00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.920
 hello everyone hello today with you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 again I and as I promised to show you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 today we will have one of the first 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.700
 lessons on making felted pears 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.220
 bulk that is, we start with a sweater with 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.040
 her darker already would have said there 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 in the previous video and many work with 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120
 light with a liver i work with a dark not 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.000
 I know why it happened so I ordered 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.350
 very big 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 packaging is very big this happiness 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.179
 so now the ceiling is over 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.590
 carrier 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.469
 so to get started with 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.179
 a leader like any other wool 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 which we will continue to tell us 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.239
 oh it will need to break for what it is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.160
 done for better entanglement of fibers 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 when tearing develops along the fibers 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.580
 then across and so forth that is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 up tearing on what strips here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 to be as small as possible here I am 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.040
 already see a little bit how much 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 there is such a lira here I am here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.899
 a little bit already prepared not big 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.729
 a ball of wool torn can it still 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:34.290
 little we are there to handle and can 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 start felting what density do we have 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 there must be a ball by sound and in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.430
 further we must demonstrate 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 remind of something wood i take 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.719
 the bun that found for the initial 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.560
 works tightly squeezing and start sticking and 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:59.390
 we put a Christmas tree bun very deep 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.759
 We try on a maximum not to injure your fingers 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.100
 because there are injuries here and very 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.990
 often 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 also about needles if you work 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.060
 in the company of his buns desirable 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.420
 don't give it to anyone because again this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.420
 you can get hurt 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 we need people we stick in the sample already 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:33.830
 began to form a clump of some 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 volume increase masters who differently 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.409
 immediately takes a lump and builds up I 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.810
 I prefer to do first small 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:48.799
 the ball before its already add volume than 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.900
 there is still such a difference if you roll 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.260
 if the belief is for the initial procurement 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.299
 for example heads we make less than she 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.060
 must actually be somewhere on the floor 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.120
 centimeter in volume from each side this 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.010
 being done in order to further 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.010
 the error of the trim we went well and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.930
 exactly and we have after that the head is not 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 it came out twice as much as her 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.290
 planning is worth the toy will be more 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.269
 than planned it is sometimes possible 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.329
 use a washcloth washcloth on my 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:28.549
 This moment is a little bit of a principle 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.000
 as the option was stuck under the straight 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.579
 by the corner 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 it is also very important to see others 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.000
 master classes 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 that's what i was talking about the rich wolf 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.760
 which is 24 notches its previous 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.550
 video that is already at this stage 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.500
 felt resistance to wool that is 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.650
 already in it hard you can hear the sound 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.340
 specifically 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:10.030
 and here in this you see it already spring 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:15.030
 3 poorly nourished fill what we do 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
 we have money for such a thing 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:23.350
 so I can see my head 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.060
 do a little bit smaller because ears 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.090
 all so gigantic in the result 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.710
 we will have a very big toy 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.220
 I would like to make it smaller than 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.220
 on the sketch 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:48.280
 I also compressed to this point, and well, 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.120
 then burning rewind but because 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.020
 they are quite laborious very convenient 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:00.310
 emerging yes and at this stage I 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.210
 replace the needle and a little bit all the same but I 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.210
 add wool 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.130
 so that's what we got here 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.169
 I think the ball and I will stop on it 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.380
 that is, if there is still so 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.250
 we can see almost closes well if 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:26.700
 the future to increase the cheek forehead back 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.620
 parts love i think thats what we see 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.020
 pretty tight ball your event 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.480
 fingers it already with quite with effort 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.060
 I can not give but he is still alive and outside 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.850
 that is, any wool sticks out of it 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.430
 because that's what we need for this to work 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.080
 happy to what extent 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.580
 run out i can drop it you hear 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.200
 wooden sound and now if the camera 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.340
 you will hear such a distinctive sound 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.560
 that only appear when you 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.680
 enough to go ahead in the 200 series will be 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.490
 not enough to fall on this here 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.320
 brilliant sound you will not hear and so 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.360
 Here are such a billet me made 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.400
 on the head and torso 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.090
 that is, on the paws, basically these are not 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.780
 do make a lot less it if 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.690
 we will do this too 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.919
 dwell later on 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.510
 this moment eatery is all 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.760
 Further videos will be already when I 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.160
 I will prepare the basis for the body that already 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.280
 what did you show and there we are more 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.669
 We become on the formation of the form 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.940
 here these counter spout Alla such here 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:38.190
 in particular because we have ears 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.979
 will be made the very most concerts 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:44.220
 tomorrow organizer in the next video we 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:49.039
 we will do junk then in a mask and then 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.039
 we will understand everything today for now
