Hey guyys !! :) 

00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:13.910
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.660
Today I have a very special video for you ^_^

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.260
And yeah ... I also wear other colors than black :&gt;

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.460
You rarely see me wearing colorful shirts haha :&gt;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.753
Well it's because I have recently received this palette 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.560
It's the Maya Mia palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
This is how it looks like

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.260
I wanna say something :)

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.434
I don't know Maya Mia in person buut

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.160
I've been following her on instagram since almost two years 

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:42.760
and her makeup pics have always been the most gorgeous ones 

00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:45.460
She has taught me so much through her videos and pictorials!

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.733
She actually follows me back 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.767
and we have commented each others pic so many times 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.554
and I'm really impressed that people can achieve something like a palette through makeup pics 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
She works together with Anastasia 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
and Anastasia has also supported me multiple times on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube 

00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:05.960
And I'm so proud of her and her achievement! 

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:08.734
Wow, congratulation! 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.160
I'm very proud of you - never stop what you're doing &lt;3

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.234
In case you see this :3

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.934
So guys ... that's what you can achieve through doing makeup ! 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
Now let's go! 

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:20.893
I'm not sure wether you have noticed it but

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.254
I tried to make my makeup fit to my t-shirt

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.860
As always I'll start with applying a primer to my eye 

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.960
Let's start with this shade called "Nude" 

00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:34.960
This shade is going to be my basis shade and I'll apply it on my whole lid

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.960
I'll pick up "Deep Brown" afterwards

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.860
It is actually no black eyeshadow but a very deep brown one ^_^

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760
I'll place this shade on my outer corner and outer v

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960
blending it into my crease 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.960
I'm also taking a fluffy blending brush to blend it 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960
As a transition color I'll use "Warm Taupe"

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.960
Blending it into my upper crease 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.960
so that there will be a perfect transition between these two shades

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.935
Before applying the really light blueish shade on my inner corner 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.960
I'll prime this area again 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.960
Next, I'll add "Aqua" to my inner corner

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.960
I'd also recommend using the blending brush that comes with the palette to blend the blue shade

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.513
so there will be no hard edges left 

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:03.960
I'll line my lids now

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.960
I'll also add some more black to my outer corner as the darkness got a little bit lost while blending 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
Blending everything together with my fluffy blending brush ...

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.560
I'll brighten up my eyelid again as it became to dark in my mind

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.780
 I'll also highlight my brow bone

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.960
using "Vanilla" - a gorgeous shimmery white shade which is perfect for highlighting 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960
Moving on to my lower lash line I'll color my waterline black 

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:53.960
Next I'll add the same color constellation as on my eye lid on to my lower lash line

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.960
Means blue - brown - dark brown

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:05.114
Last but not least I'll apply mascara 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.900
And add falsies - this is an optional step means that if 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.960
you don't like false eyelashes for some reason you can easily skip this step

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
Done with the eye makeup! :)

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:17.860
Moving on to my face I'll highlight my under eye area first  

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.960
and cover any eyeshadow that has fallen down 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.793
I decided to do a little highlight this time

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.960
Highlighting my under eye area, the bridge of my nose, my chin and my forehead

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.651
As always I'll blend it into my skin

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:45.960
To set my foundation and concealer in place throughout the day I'll apply powder all over my face

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.094
As already mentioned I have tried to make my makeup fit to my shirt 

00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:00.358
That's why I'll apply two lipsticks today

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:02.560
The Magenta one is too extreme in my eyes 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.460
while the Nude one looks way to boring

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.960
I'll apply the Nude first

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.960
and then add the Magenta on the outer corners of my lips blending it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.660
I'll also define my lips a little bit using concealer and a cut brush...

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.960
... and added transparent lipgloss ... DONE &lt;3

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.295
I hope you like the look :3

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.960
