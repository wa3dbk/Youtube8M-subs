00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.140
 14 years later the discussion about whether 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.450
 the knives of small dimensions 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.040
 They should be considered or not stab 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.380
 has returned to the congress of the deputies 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.580
 on that occasion the proposal of the pp 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.620
 to reform the security law 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.720
 citizen earned him an electoral whip 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.609
 the popular candidate to the Augustinian board 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.980
 with which it was disputed to the presidency 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.869
 as jose bono this time have been 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.220
 the nationalists of the pv who have 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.989
 presented a proposition not of law 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.550
 to be subject to the condition 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.589
 Weapon the knives under 11 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.599
 centimeters of leaf were left out 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.220
 this classification at the time the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.899
 Deputy Albacete Francisco Miller 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.640
 was in charge of debating this 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.609
 proposal already the nationalist party 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.280
 Basque acted a little bit 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.320
 let's call it political hypocrisy 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.640
 because it is not a receipt that is 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.610
 trying to ban a knife from less 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.320
 of 11 centimeters when we know which is 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.290
 the industry that has 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.290
 what is firearms and explosives 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.350
 then as I said to Mr. Barred 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.720
 you can not see 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 to the life 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.880
 in the alien eye and the beam in the eye 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.860
 own the penis v with the support of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 convergence and union ensured that the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.130
 Weapons law is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.570
 insufficient and that its use is behind 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 of 60 percent of crimes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 committed the context pp that the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.510
 Spanish legislation is adapted to the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.680
 European directives on the subject and 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.390
 that the limitations of use that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850
 they raised the nationalists are already 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 collected in our regulations 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 finally pp and psoe rejected her 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.760
 unfounded and untimely what has been sitting 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.530
 pretty bad to the cutlers 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.690
 Albacete has been that the representative 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.910
 of the pdv would refer to this activity 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.940
 disparagingly as a monoculture 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.250
 industrial what I ask is actually 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.050
 justice of justice and that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.900
 delinquent who misuses this 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.640
 tool because they catch and they apply 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.170
 the law as they have to apply it not that 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.050
 take and enter through a door and you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.930
 leave for another but the offender 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.790
 is the one who has to be caught and castellar not 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 to the manufacturer that the only thing that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.490
 is to bring the daily bread to their children 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.170
 miller explained during the debate 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.190
 parliamentary on the subject that enters 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.800
 the years 2008 and 2012 to decrease 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 37 the incidence of bladed weapons in the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.310
 commission of crimes as an example of 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.030
 the guarantees offered by the current 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.030
 legislation in this respect
