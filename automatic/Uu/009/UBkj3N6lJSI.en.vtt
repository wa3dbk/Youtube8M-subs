00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.380
 hello I'm n 36 and we're in a new 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.390
 tutorial and good today I'm going to show you 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.700
 how to make a villager generator 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.220
 infinite very easy since I have it 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.860
 asked very much very much but 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.850
 very much 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.650
 and the simplest generator that I know and 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.250
 which I always do and I never 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.470
 it fails so nothing we are going to select 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 a point where 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.150
 what will be the center of our 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.110
 generator so to speak then a 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.780
 block more 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.470
 leaving a block we will make a square of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 3 x 3 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.020
 so important to put the corners because 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.330
 she is full and a zombie comes here 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.560
 You can get it by hitting or killing or 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.820
 how you can die all of the villa 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.690
 so we do not put anything like that we make a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 barrier so they do not escape and 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.670
 we have two blocks and from this east 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.520
 block we count six up towards 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.430
 one two three four five and six and that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 will be our our platform where 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.860
 will go the villager who will activate the village 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.860
 say it like that then we'll do something like that 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.390
 we will put a villager here two villagers 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.330
 here this unfortunately I will have 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.540
 what to kill because they can not put two 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.380
 villas together so you can but not 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.729
 it will work 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.689
 so we 're going to extend the doors 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.689
 and there would be that would be the villa 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.980
 is activated to kill in the neck that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.140
 it will also affect the villa 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.180
 ok they already had this platform what 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.480
 let's do this is very important 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.400
 I do not know if it will influence but I always 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.700
 it works when I do it that way you have to 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.590
 put in this and this or where is it going to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.920
 be the platform will be in this and in the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.240
 something like this very easy 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.240
 they can do it like this 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.090
 they can do it like this 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.040
 and there but I do not know to me has not 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.480
 worked as many times as this one to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.130
 west so I recommend that you 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.989
 do so you can do it from both 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.020
 ways and but I recommend them well 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.310
 now they are going to place the doors watching 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.770
 out and another click and another here and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.560
 they will put 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.800
 Remove stress if it bothers you so much 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.870
 so that way we'll have the villa created 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.590
 and should I run them and will 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.150
 show some ways to upload to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.360
 villagers for example climb up the day 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.770
 9 we can search for what can 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.490
 do with rails 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.490
 or with 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.440
 or same with water elevators of 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.440
 Water 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.310
 over and we're going to show you how to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170
 you can go up a local village so you 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.430
 It has to be on a clear little stairway 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.890
 that is creative and is easier but 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.400
 well, it is not very difficult to do 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.400
 a stair 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.360
 and so 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.960
 this can already be removed by animals 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.740
 temporary 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.880
 so I'm not going to do it with a king 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.600
 propellers because he says they are a bit 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.760
 expensive that some will not have so 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.019
 nothing 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.270
 let's put real here for example 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.160
 have they have their villager saved here 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.080
 and I would recommend you do this if 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.510
 they have a soldier and saved them 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.780
 I would recommend that you put the main card 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.990
 push and break the block and already ride it 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.940
 remove these blocks from here I do 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.780
 pushing like this 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.280
 and the area does not come up with you 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.620
 so let's see 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.770
 they put it in there, I'm going to do it 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.090
 server because I feel that the first thing in 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.090
 put a peak but 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.389
 exact 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.720
 get in the allianz or wind or less grip 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.130
 blocks so first they're going to break 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.009
 this 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.480
 this rail and here I do not know if I put the 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.520
 It seems to me that I did not rail 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.900
 I would recommend you not to put 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.810
 close him there because it would be harder 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.740
 to remove it if the villager behaves well 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.020
 clear well and it would already be covering what is or 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.360
 not grab what I apologize would be 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.370
 cover it like that and it's ready from the liana 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.719
 these villagers at home can make 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.920
 the same way only that this is more 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:05.470
 easy because they are at ground level 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.729
 and with a water lift as it would be 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.940
 well 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.970
 would be bringing the village not to a tube 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.190
 so it 's more complicated but good 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.760
 It will make you more comfortable some times 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.760
 they have iron 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.580
 make 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.860
 they would make a very big tube yes 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.860
 with edges so they do not escape 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.220
 and so here we are going to kill this the 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.720
 plain I recommend that they hit us with 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.420
 the villagers because that's what you're about 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.920
 The villages 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.920
 can get up to date with the worst or 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.500
 better with that and what we're going to do 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.900
 is the typical typical water sensor and 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.120
 posters 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.320
 so just that this way does not 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.630
 you control both the villager but good 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.100
 let's put a poster to what poster 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.520
 here 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.090
 A) Yes 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.090
 A) Yes 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.380
 they can put up signs that also 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.390
 and I would be putting water here 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.190
 here the most about what you can 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.190
 get away so it 's one more height 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.230
 and I do here 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.919
 how can I remove are there 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.790
 we go up here one and another 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.590
 and what you have to do is put your 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.590
 the day 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.790
 can not find the main card or 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.060
 not pushing something and the allies 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.310
 as nothing will rise 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.400
 and the same thing that should be done is 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.750
 wait for him here at the moment to 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.160
 to lock it in here and that's it and those are the 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.900
 two ways I know of climbing 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.020
 villagers maybe there are others but 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.180
 nothing are not the ones that I did runner and 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.389
 the ones that I have used the most 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.330
 of the main card so if you liked it 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:13.160
 the tutorial or if it has served you please 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.110
 Give it like a share 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.110
 and see you in the next video goodbye
