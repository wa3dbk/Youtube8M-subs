pop it up to number five and then your

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.270 
pop it up to number five and then your
spins<00:02:30.600> because<00:02:31.260> he<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:32.010> going

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
spins because he on there that's going

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.260 
spins because he on there that's going
to<00:02:32.370> wash<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.850> 1200<00:02:33.720> rpm<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.430> does<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.910> up

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
to wash it 1200 rpm but that does go up

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.240 
to wash it 1200 rpm but that does go up
quite<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> lot<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:37.530> than<00:02:37.770> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
quite a lot more than that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.550

you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.180> choose<00:02:39.390> no<00:02:39.660> spin<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.320> you've<00:02:40.440> got

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you can choose no spin if you've got

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.590 
you can choose no spin if you've got
something<00:02:40.800> delicate<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> low

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600

something delicate in you can have a low
spin<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.760> there<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.420> goes<00:02:45.660> right

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
spin you can see there it goes right

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130 
spin you can see there it goes right
through<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.440> programs<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> could<00:02:48.990> hear

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
when it first came on there was a nice

when it first came on there was a nice
little<00:02:52.080> tune<00:02:52.620> plays<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:54.000> actually<00:02:54.180> mute

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
little tune plays you can actually mute

little tune plays you can actually mute
that<00:02:55.080> although<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.980> don't<00:02:56.130> why<00:02:56.340> you'd<00:02:56.520> want<00:02:56.700> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that although I don't why you'd want to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.150 
that although I don't why you'd want to
because<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.270> quite<00:02:57.570> nice<00:02:57.950> when<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
because it's quite nice when you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
keep waiting to see how long your

keep waiting to see how long your
machines<00:03:08.490> got<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:10.650> shows<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.950> here

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
machines got but this shows you here

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.600 
machines got but this shows you here
that's<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.810> 57<00:03:13.500> minute<00:03:13.770> wash<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
that's going to be a 57 minute wash and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.920 
that's going to be a 57 minute wash and
then<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:15.000> pop<00:03:15.210> back<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.810> see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
then you just pop back in and see

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.170 
then you just pop back in and see
whether<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.350> washings<00:03:16.800> done<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.790> can<00:03:17.970> see

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
whether you washings done you can see

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.270 
whether you washings done you can see
how<00:03:18.390> not<00:03:18.540> exactly<00:03:19.050> how<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> man<00:03:19.440> gets<00:03:19.470> got<00:03:19.890> left

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
how not exactly how a man gets got left

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610 
how not exactly how a man gets got left
like<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.330> said<00:03:21.510> before<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.900> got<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.230> core

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
like I said before it's got the core

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.570 
like I said before it's got the core
bubble<00:03:23.010> which<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:25.470> creates<00:03:25.890> bubbles<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
bubble which it creates bubbles on the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.970 
bubble which it creates bubbles on the
outside<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.420> your<00:03:27.450> drum<00:03:27.840> apparently<00:03:28.709> mitt

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
outside of your drum apparently mitt

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.790 
outside of your drum apparently mitt
mixes<00:03:29.640> your<00:03:30.000> detergent<00:03:30.570> with<00:03:31.020> water<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.620> air

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
mixes your detergent with water and air

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.979 
mixes your detergent with water and air
and<00:03:32.070> then<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.520> forces<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.300> bubbles<00:03:33.690> up

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and then it forces the bubbles up

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.410 
and then it forces the bubbles up
through<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.500> holes<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.310> drum<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.850> that's

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
through the holes in the drum and that's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
through the holes in the drum and that's
supposed<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> give<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> better<00:03:37.380> wash<00:03:37.800> which

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
supposed to give you a better wash which

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.400 
supposed to give you a better wash which
I<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.700> say<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:38.970> I've<00:03:39.660> used<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:40.020> machine<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
I can say is I've used this machine a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.860 
I can say is I've used this machine a
few<00:03:40.530> times<00:03:41.010> now<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.209> absolutely

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
few times now and it's absolutely

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.920 
few times now and it's absolutely
brilliant<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.590> can't<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.000> any<00:03:45.330> program

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
brilliant I can't think of any program

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.449 
brilliant I can't think of any program
on<00:03:46.050> there<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.500> would<00:03:46.709> need<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.340> it
