third of the way before it started
engaging<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.599> know<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.130> engine<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.050> tried

engaging you know the engine so I tried

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
engaging you know the engine so I tried
adjusting<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> sort<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.670> pulled<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
adjusting it and sort of pulled out so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.200 
adjusting it and sort of pulled out so
I'm<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> apart<00:00:38.210> see

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I'm going to have to take this apart see

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.459 
I'm going to have to take this apart see
how<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.660> together<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.480> put<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> cable

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
how it goes together and put the cable

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.010 
how it goes together and put the cable
back<00:00:43.710> into<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.480> hope<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> only

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
back into it I hope that's the only

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.520 
back into it I hope that's the only
problem<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:47.190> anyways<00:00:47.870> let's<00:00:48.870> take<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> quick

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
problem but anyways let's take a quick

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.670 
problem but anyways let's take a quick
look<00:00:49.739> underneath<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> looks

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
look underneath and see what it looks

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.610 
look underneath and see what it looks
like<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.160> where<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> screws<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:56.780> well<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like and where the screws are well this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
like and where the screws are well this
is<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> underside<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.609> right<00:01:02.609> hand<00:01:03.000> grip

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is the underside of the right hand grip

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.200 
is the underside of the right hand grip
assembly<00:01:04.350> thing<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:07.640> guess<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> get

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
assembly thing and I guess I have to get

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.260 
assembly thing and I guess I have to get
underneath<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> look<00:01:10.350> because

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
underneath to take a look because

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.899 
underneath to take a look because
looking<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.380> upside<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.610> with

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
looking on the you know upside down with

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.710 
looking on the you know upside down with
the<00:01:15.619> camera<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.880> can't<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.180> clearly

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the camera I can't see it clearly

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
the camera I can't see it clearly
anyways<00:01:19.229> I'll<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.650> underneath<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> take<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
anyways I'll get underneath and take a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
anyways I'll get underneath and take a
look<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> we'll<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.450> where<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.960> from

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
look and we'll see where we go from

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
look and we'll see where we go from
there<00:01:26.240> after<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.930> closer<00:01:28.290> examination<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
there after a closer examination the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.590 
there after a closer examination the
screw<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.579> assume<00:01:36.329> that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
screw to take this off I assume that's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.539 
screw to take this off I assume that's
the<00:01:36.689> screw<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.430> front<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:40.549> course

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the screw is actually in front of course

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.690 
the screw is actually in front of course
right<00:01:42.090> behind<00:01:43.640> this<00:01:44.640> plastic<00:01:45.619> piece<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
right behind this plastic piece so I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700 
right behind this plastic piece so I
have<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> take<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> plastic<00:01:48.840> first

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.010 

and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:56.590> get<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.980> that<00:01:57.010> screw

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and then I can get to that screw

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.260 
and then I can get to that screw
now<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.840> here<00:02:05.350> whoops<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.580> think<00:02:07.060> these

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
now the okay here whoops I think these

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.570 
now the okay here whoops I think these
are<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.600> only<00:02:07.720> two<00:02:07.990> screws<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.560> take<00:02:08.770> off<00:02:08.979> this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
are the only two screws to take off this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.960 
are the only two screws to take off this
one<00:02:09.850> on<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.149> side<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.370> other<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.610> on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
one on this side and the other one on

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.590 
one on this side and the other one on
this<00:02:13.330> side<00:02:15.300> well

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
this side well

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.170 
this side well
here<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:18.180> front<00:02:19.180> end<00:02:19.420> off<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:25.000> were

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
here is the front end off now there were

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.290 
here is the front end off now there were
two<00:02:25.210> little<00:02:25.630> screws<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> bottom<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
two little screws in the bottom like I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.370 
two little screws in the bottom like I
showed<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:30.220> third<00:02:30.490> one<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:32.050> front

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
showed you and a third one in the front

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.790 
showed you and a third one in the front
so<00:02:32.890> two<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> back<00:02:33.550> one<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> front<00:02:34.890> now

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
so two in the back one in the front now

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.460 
so two in the back one in the front now
now<00:02:38.800> here<00:02:39.430> are<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.700> hex<00:02:40.000> keys<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:41.110> take<00:02:41.290> this

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
now here are the hex keys to take this

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.390 
now here are the hex keys to take this
off<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.810> top<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:44.560> underneath<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:48.160> looks

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
off one on top one underneath that looks

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.110 
off one on top one underneath that looks
fairly<00:02:48.730> simple<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.440> let's<00:02:50.709> see<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.850> can<00:02:52.000> do

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
fairly simple now let's see if I can do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
fairly simple now let's see if I can do
that<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.810> course<00:02:53.020> I'll<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.530> after

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.449 

after<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:58.630> I'm<00:02:59.320> going<00:02:59.739> in<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.100> have<00:03:00.130> some

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
after I well I'm going in to have some

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:28.960 
after I well I'm going in to have some
coffee<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.030> spend<00:03:01.510> some<00:03:01.690> time<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:01.959> my<00:03:02.440> dog

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.910 

it<00:03:47.120> appears<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.989> end<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.379> cable<00:03:48.739> has

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.000 
it appears the end of the cable has
snapped<00:03:49.310> off<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.569> I'll<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.590> actually

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010

snapped off so I'll have to actually
replace<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.910> cable<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:54.500> will<00:03:54.800> take<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.010> bit

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
