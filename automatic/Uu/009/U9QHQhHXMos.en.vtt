00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.730
 few cats cattle I have the last 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.259
 time deeply absorbed in horse dung because 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.040
 it seems that you can do a lot of it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.570
 to learn 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.670
 and we are going today has a shit 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 to investigate 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 I hope actually to have pooped 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.450
 otherwise our entire pot will be investigated 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.490
 that through 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 I see all that is empty there in the corner 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.039
 Before I go pick does have a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.039
 Hand good boring 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 we are going to fill them 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 but it just pooped action from good 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 fresh turd 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 and it seems that if you want to go poo 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.030
 to investigate 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 you actually can do I deserve all 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.899
 need a big choice 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 and yes I think one of mars I had 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.710
 it's really enough for him who has one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 well lost cuddle it is also whole 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.100
 good to very often you stall out to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.660
 fattening because the less shit and the light 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 less chance is also that the poo in it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 hay is coming and so she can do less 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 are going to eat 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 know about the fun is about horses 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 phuket you can finance us 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.190
 smell immediately because pair is shit 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.590
 actually a kind of facebook for that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 can be horses in horse poo 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.960
 feeling lost they can smell or they 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 dominant , we are sad, we are happy 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 let the manure study begin that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
 I get there now you are not a full biologist 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 or one more so becomes your gloves 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.740
 chili peppers 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.630
 well we are now with the shit from before 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.729
 around and these are one of the nicest 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.619
 just plain kind of big hard 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 cobblestones but it can also be different 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.580
 look like and then you don't have to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.409
 scared because couple who very much like the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 up late and therefore eat a lot of grass 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.329
 we usually have some sort of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.280
 dark green brownish we turd and that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.689
 can be diminished by the sleepers then it is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.030
 nothing wrong with it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.799
 you also have paris in a stable say whole 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 bored much know a lot of straw 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.299
 a few who eat a lot of electricity and often 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 my eyes pop out a bit 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.909
 falls apart 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.890
 well there are a few things where you 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 really pay attention and cool me 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.610
 mean is very little yellowish and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.399
 extremely hard 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.799
 well and we can rule that out for fun 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.140
 because you see that he is not rock hard either 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.850
 not yellowish just a bit useful 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 well on cooly droid among those full 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
 cannot exclude the city 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.689
 the next thing you need to look good at 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 pay attention to the fact that there is blood in the knife and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.160
 often sina you would think blood in the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.450
 master is that turd bright red but that is 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.450
 so not so that 's a bit of it 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.980
 done dangerously 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.349
 is a very easy way to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.730
 test if there is blood in it you take it 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.870
 brother 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.890
 an smear or a white leaf 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.370
 look you can then it just your name 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.610
 write and now you can see it 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 nice green dark brown 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 if there is blood in it then it colors 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.980
 pink leaf and that is very dangerous 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.019
 then you must be a real veterinarian 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.760
 call because then it can be a stomach ulcer 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.500
 have or have a stomach bleeding that's real 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.450
 very dangerous that of the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.349
 exterior soft and dry out well 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.180
 it is also very nice to meet the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.090
 look inside what exactly 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.060
 in does not look very much the hoi 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.390
 You all come across hay and Ned saw 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.069
 I also already a piece of px that fit muesli 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.720
 I have not seen any forks yet 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.849
 in a very fascinating way 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.799
 further explore that format 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.640
 chunks of hi are all ground in the 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:10.209
 just choose here very small place the four 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 small pieces of hay it funny horses 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.890
 have 16 to 24 meters of intestine on average 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.660
 and they then have to work continuously 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.760
 stay because you know it is real 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.620
 very important we can 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.090
 we can of course surrender and if 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 we are not doing something well in the gut 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.290
 we can surrender a few cans 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.389
 only through the comes out so that there 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
 have kept it well keep going and 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.780
 for that , a lot of beautiful nature 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.579
 feel about you eating that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.549
 all she is it is she not that we 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.560
 continuously working those bits of it 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.720
 grind own how it is 10 to 12 hours 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.760
 be busy with roughage 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.500
 well dear nice and busy i just grab it 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.910
 the new turd and on the outside they 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.980
 back you looked good on the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.079
 inside looked good in months 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.359
 cumbersome way where you can text very well 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.590
 if your horse is healthy and that's him 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.730
 are going to heat up the test 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.260
 well i him and dry now to the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.299
 washing place and we will investigate whether 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.160
 forms in sitting and you can do that whole 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.599
 do it conveniently through him in one 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.069
 the coffee shop just to throw one 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.989
 normal coffee filter 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.060
 and him you go and filter with water 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.560
 and ultimately you look at what remains 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.220
 is a species that occurs the most 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.040
 the white and the red ones are the blood worms 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.289
 and with every form of money, the smaller it is 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.940
 form is how dangerous there is even meaner 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.090
 which is so you should not be scared if 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.880
 your son really lives 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.169
 that is often the less 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.800
 aggressive 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.800
 just the tap 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.360
 must have had a snake not too hard 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.000
 if you spray very hard then it suddenly comes 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.740
 or large hole in the fall everything is gone 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.180
 very slowly 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.180
 Gently turn the tap 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.970
 youth of all parts that oven is so and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.300
 eventually if you get it completely right 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.220
 such has been done until everything is out 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.600
 You have to see what the public can do 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.120
 here see that for something bigger 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.650
 pieces of hay are left over 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.530
 but here you can clearly see that none 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.410
 words in it 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.870
 she draws me that you have no forms so 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.460
 that is super good news 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.889
 Well last swing when it briefly 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.990
 neatly dump our poop on the dung heap 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.030
 and know what happens to each 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.860
 corn syrup is collected by knife farmer 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.510
 and it is brought true to mushroom 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.490
 fields so if you ever again 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.070
 mushroom eat eat tasty to it 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.750
 grows thanks to horse poo thank you 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.520

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.510
 really cool is you just the name of you
