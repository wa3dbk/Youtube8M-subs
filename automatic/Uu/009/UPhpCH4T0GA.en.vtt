the exact steps um of course is also

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.740 
the exact steps um of course is also
written<00:02:19.599> steps<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.930> which<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:23.000> will<00:02:23.629> get

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
written steps of this which you will get

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.410 
written steps of this which you will get
a<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.140> God<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:25.430> well<00:02:25.819> with<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.209> video

exactly what I'm doing

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.130 
exactly what I'm doing
so<00:02:29.810> first<00:02:30.079> step<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.760> also<00:02:31.760> insert<00:02:32.269> your<00:02:32.750> SIM

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
photo SIM card which is the SIM card

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.979 
photo SIM card which is the SIM card
that<00:02:37.670> doesn't<00:02:38.030> work<00:02:38.209> with<00:02:38.389> this<00:02:38.510> point<00:02:38.720> it's

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
that doesn't work with this point it's

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.800 
that doesn't work with this point it's
Rogers<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.859> I've<00:02:40.519> inserted<00:02:40.849> a<00:02:41.120> fido
