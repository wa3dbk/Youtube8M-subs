here and reappears quickly here okay

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.420 
here and reappears quickly here okay
same<00:05:42.419> full<00:05:42.690> speed<00:05:43.040> it'll<00:05:44.040> look<00:05:44.250> something

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
same full speed it'll look something

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.230 
same full speed it'll look something
like<00:05:44.640> this

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
like this

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.600 
like this
you<00:05:45.600> would<00:05:45.750> say<00:05:45.900> okay<00:05:46.140> watch<00:05:46.350> carefully<00:05:46.979> one

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
you would say okay watch carefully one

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.150 
you would say okay watch carefully one
two<00:05:48.300> three<00:05:49.260> okay<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.820> right<00:05:51.030> timing<00:05:52.160> makes

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
two three okay so the right timing makes

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.790 
two three okay so the right timing makes
this<00:05:53.310> trick<00:05:53.700> I'll<00:05:54.540> look<00:05:54.930> much<00:05:55.290> much<00:05:55.530> more

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
this trick I'll look much much more

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.380 
this trick I'll look much much more
better<00:05:55.979> okay<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.669> course<00:05:56.729> if<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.120> have<00:05:57.270> the

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
better okay of course if you have the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.270 
better okay of course if you have the
wrong<00:05:57.570> timing<00:05:57.870> something<00:05:58.200> like<00:05:58.530> this<00:05:58.740> I<00:06:01.280> mean

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
wrong timing something like this I mean

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.400 
wrong timing something like this I mean
it<00:06:02.669> looks<00:06:03.150> impressive<00:06:03.450> but<00:06:03.780> it's<00:06:04.080> not<00:06:04.260> that

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
it looks impressive but it's not that

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.350 
it looks impressive but it's not that
impressive<00:06:04.800> if<00:06:05.100> it<00:06:05.550> would<00:06:05.700> happen<00:06:05.940> at<00:06:06.240> the

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
impressive if it would happen at the

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.110 
impressive if it would happen at the
same<00:06:06.570> time<00:06:06.840> okay<00:06:07.500> and<00:06:07.740> once<00:06:08.370> you<00:06:08.580> have

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
same time okay and once you have

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.740 
same time okay and once you have
produced<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:09.660> card<00:06:09.930> and<00:06:10.140> made<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.740> disappear

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
produced a card and made it disappear

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.360 
produced a card and made it disappear

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
first of all you pause for a second so

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.440 
first of all you pause for a second so
this<00:06:16.830> packet<00:06:17.190> you<00:06:17.250> can<00:06:17.280> see<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:17.700> and<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:18.300> need

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
this packet you can see it and you need

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.510 
this packet you can see it and you need
that<00:06:18.600> hold<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:19.350> calibrate<00:06:19.830> underneath<00:06:20.370> the

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
that hold to calibrate underneath the

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.610 
that hold to calibrate underneath the
top<00:06:20.729> card<00:06:21.060> once<00:06:21.750> you<00:06:21.870> have<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.200> break
