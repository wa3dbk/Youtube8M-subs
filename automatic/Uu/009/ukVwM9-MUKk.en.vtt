00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello everyone for a long time not seen now how 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.719
 u can see and opened dota not second and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 first I opened now we dota and I 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.400
 opened warcraft 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.680
 and the first dota is just a warcraft map 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.430
 which gained popularity 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.510
 improved and it turned out 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.330
 miracle as the second dota 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.529
 but experienced everybody knows I decided to 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 tell their heroes what they were 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
 first, that is what you all know 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 they are not as such that Rikimaru 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.790
 you can see ulta inesse there now 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
 things in the initial dota they were a little 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 on another even to say very strongly 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 differently their little by little 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 perfected daughters added something 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.360
 cleaned and it turned out such that we 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 now we see but at the beginning it was 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.879
 completely different I consoled myself from the open 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.539
 project and about all the heroes to tell 1 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.879
 series 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.730
 one hero is coming right now 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 the dota card and we look at the hero 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 rikimaru 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.449
 Well, that's the dotan of the very first version as 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 you can see it looks like 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.330
 the interface is all similar but damn it all 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.939
 cool soldering when not bout also 7 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.939
 tobot 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:21.180
 as you can see here is such a boss but Tipo 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.170
 such there as one seller and there 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 all and in the first dota as you can see 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.549
 winding 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.240
 Socle relic here in general cool okay 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.450
 our goal is now rikimaru and to survey it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 survey as well, just like in the way here 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.360
 second dota the huckster they were called here 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.659
 they stand for dyre and for sintela so here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 pike and rikimaru as you can see 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.070
 his 2 taverns are very few heroes so 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.170
 peeped go teleport appear here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.509
 so here as you can see it is red 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.259
 satyr is called it fat and steel 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.030
 assassin che there is in general so here it is 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.810
 leaving visually as to not Rikimaru 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.940
 very similar but if so take a closer look 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.650
 the similarity is a cool Russian voice acting 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.280
 By the way in the first dota that I really 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.560
 liked it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.010
 very cool voice acting 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.830
 on skills first skill and how everything 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 accustomed to 1 3 skill swing at first 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.989
 ulta levels on the sixth in the first dota in 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.520
 The initial maps were different 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.220
 the first skill is swinging on the third level 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.260
 second skill the third skill can be downloaded in 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.900
 first level ulta as usual what 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.720
 I poured out and Ulta way to swing at three 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.879
 left as usual she is two labels here 3 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.879
 lvla three leveled 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:48.660
 so here is 1 of 1 skill 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.360
 he is in english but if i'm not mistaken 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.030
 translated so the hero goes into 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.310
 invisibility if no one is attacked as 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 familiarly second skill 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.019
 this blink maginy is the same here 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.940
 cool thing i mean dota 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.780
 present as dlink to any 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 unit still deals damage and third skill 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.060
 like the cult of the amortization just creed 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.920
 probability of 15 percent warrior get comfortable 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.450
 it's just an ability gets a chance 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.580
 inflict additional damage in each 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.200
 attack doubled triply 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.799
 fourfold increase in damage 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.180
 probability of 15 percent passive and 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.220
 ulta 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.140
 and ulta he has something that we were like 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.920
 how on world she translates he 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.440
 urges 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.730
 damage trap 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.530
 hero well and so damage heroes here on 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.400
 first level is 75 damage one by one 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.540
 targets that is at the second level 25 damage 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.409
 on two goals 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.439
 Well, in general , let's just go for a run 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.739
 convey and see how not thick 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:04:00.700
 Forests here I do not remember how to say it so 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:05.019
 would not be the boss to be honest like a harmless 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.019
 and by the way in the head of the dota cards 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.540
 Aegis, he does not fall out of his boss 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.269
 buy and it acts three times like this 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.769
 Well that's garbage candy we went 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.000
 nuclear knows everything + 2 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.070
 everything here is the throne is I do not think that 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.820
 that I just opened the map there settings 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.780
 you can do it here too t4 as a card 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.360
 barracks all played on the development here 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.060
 such here it seems to have been created 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:41.070
 this is the card from this one 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:44.169
 let's go a little huckster in general, that's all 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.020
 Well, in general, okay, that's the same thing, everything is there 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.450
 all and the rack sayings hours somehow 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.870
 I'll find a version later that is now 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.270
 version seems to be 6.6 something but this version 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.669
 096 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.410
 Now some version 5 and see 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:07.389
 Is this version 5.36 changed there? 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.950
 and there are 8 to these versions there is little 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.590
 changed so I didn't 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:18.490
 bother here is version 5.36 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:21.280
 from the wards rica maru he already became 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.370
 less well as red as the devil 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.970
 some such skills he has all the same 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.979
 the most but but but as we can see already 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.520
 quietly quietly they already 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.160
 change now costa on 50 there was 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.139
 I do not remember the other now, but 10 kcal gave on 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.050
 first level for 4 2 seconds cooldown 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:45.120
 it's all just lovely as 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.729
 seconds cooldown too cool on what 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.950
 To go nuts think like blink third skill 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:55.770
 already the same thing almost 15 percent everywhere 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:02.830
 but what is it 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:05.520
 15 times normal damage and exactly 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.890
 that is, 15 percent odds and a half 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.760
 percent oh one and a half creed then two 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.280
 interest loan 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.100
 athermal home to a total of one and a half from 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.890
 normal damage creed 2 2 bedrooms in 3 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.710
 times more ataman damage and ulta 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:24.220
 it can be started the most four catching 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.970
 swing the first level is 60 damage and 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:32.290
 one goal moto85 runner well these traps 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.700
 the girl spoke two targets 110 damage 2 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.820
 target and 150 damage 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.970
 three objectives that have fallen slightly changed 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:44.110
 appeared incidentally by the way good roshan 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.990
 he's already a little other creep already more 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.950
 the creeps habitual to us are not greedy 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.860
 and now more dense forest inhabited 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.040
 neutrals 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.230
 I will lose such here if the throne and they are the same 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.120
 most like 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.870
 in general, that's not the norm some changes already 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.810
 in 5.36 small but not all the same there but 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.050
 with primary skills not yet now 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.780
 and again check and this is one of the last 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.650
 Dota cards honestly did not find in which 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.650
 map 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.810
 and changed the look of his rikimaru here honestly 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.850
 I say a lot court rummaged and here it is 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.860
 sent one of the most penultimate 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:28.120
 then we choose it 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:31.150
 he is already in his appearance of such a family 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.250
 already changed in not the red devil and here 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.190
 already skills that we already know 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.190
 ultop photo stealth if nobody 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:44.860
 attack 3 2 1 second 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:49.610
 from the back creed 050 75 125 blink to the unit 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:54.320
 and here . that is, already 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:57.270
 that is, the river has changed not so long ago 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.570
 Well, in general, that's all this is my first 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.180
 thank you very much project 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:05.580
 add what to add what to remove for 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.190
 It is very important to me because I am long 

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:11.480
 with this release bother 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.480
 Well, that's all thanks to you all bye
