00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.139
 one of the very common 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.969
 delusion 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.969
 what not to drink while training 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.869
 This technique does not hydrate the body. 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.300
 present but it is already professional 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.550
 sport if you are a normal person and you 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.119
 do fitness fitness or 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.470
 just improving yourself and you 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.159
 today you can call it like you 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.510
 I would recommend you to drink water 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.550
 during your workout if you don't drink 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 water and you sweat then your blood 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.040
 thickens and here it is this process it gives 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.140
 you have a very high load 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.570
 cardiovascular system ie 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 it's very hard for my heart to pump viscous 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 blood and your brain will not get 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.860
 enough oxygen because 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 that viscous blood will no longer be normal 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.970
 pass through the capillaries of the head 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.600
 brain there are many newbies who 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.830
 come to the hall and or other girls who 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.340
 come to engage in group 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.579
 programs 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.860
 first time ie they are during the day 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.600
 drank a little water from them quite strongly 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.060
 blood clots during the training session 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.740
 there is a load for them high and that is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.689
 they get dizzy and it happens 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.179
 up to the loss of consciousness that is and even 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.840
 happen 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.350
 incident so in order to avoid 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.080
 no negative points during 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.870
 training in small portions is 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.540
 12 small smoothly every five ten 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.180
 do it there for minutes, drink it regularly 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.780
 water and you will feel good 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.910
 if the geek should put your plans 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.980
 quite ambitious and you want 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.320
 achieve impressive sports 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.290
 results you can make yourself 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.690
 some drink 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.080
 amino acid solution or protein cocktail 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 which you will drink closer to 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.690
 the end of the workout that is in the end 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.220
 help speed recovery 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.290
 processes but drinking protein or 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.420
 amino acid solutions on nissan 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.860
 training was enough 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.020
 high digestive load 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.620
 the system after all the organism will be this all 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.660
 assimilate the cash and no longer work 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 get such a summer house training 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 process
