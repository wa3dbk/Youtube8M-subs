00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because by them actually taking the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.310 
because by them actually taking the
extra<00:01:25.890> step<00:01:26.400> SN<00:01:27.180> by<00:01:27.330> yoshida<00:01:27.780> they're

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
extra step SN by yoshida they're

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.420 
extra step SN by yoshida they're
actually<00:01:28.619> showing<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.100> care<00:01:29.340> about

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
actually showing how they care about

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 
actually showing how they care about
their<00:01:29.579> fans<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.780> reason<00:01:31.170> they're<00:01:31.290> probably

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
their fans the reason they're probably

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.350 
their fans the reason they're probably
not<00:01:31.680> making<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> compatible<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> box

not making it compatible out of the box

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120 
not making it compatible out of the box
is<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.900> want<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.500> more

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
is because they want it to have more

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.770 
is because they want it to have more
potential<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.329> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.689> be
