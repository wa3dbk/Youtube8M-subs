00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 for the cndh the English and today as they can 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 see I bring you some ideas of how 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.160
 You can wear your scarves are super 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.260
 simple some of them maybe already 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.179
 to the station for yourselves 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 but I want to show you some of the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 ideas that I have of how they can 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 take it especially now that in some 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 countries is doing well a fried well 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 rich as in mine that regularly does not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.960
 he does it and in others it 's getting cold 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 super huge basically all the video 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.289
 I will be using the same when 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 that is white one of my favorites 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.070
 of coverage or bad if you like this 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 kind of example videos here in the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 comments on what they would like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 speak a next video like this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 giving him tip and now let's start with 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 the first way is very simple 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 we take the scarf and fold it in two 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 as you can see here and it looks like 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 this holes and in the middle just what 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.489
 what we do is pass it here and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 we enter the part that remains for us here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.570
 we can tighten a little we take the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.570
 hair 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.520
 and we have something like this, this is the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.530
 easiest way to wear the scarf 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.350
 this other way resembles the previous one 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.120
 we took the hole we had but a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.220
 place between the two points what 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 we do is we take one of the tips 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.470
 we introduce it later what we are going to 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.380
 do with this hole is that we're going to 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.310
 twist the little one and we enter the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.270
 another tip and this is the result 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.030
 another way I like to use 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 my scarf is simply I open it the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.460
 it went over my neck and what I do 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.460
 is to form a knot in this way 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.630
 perhaps I take out my hair 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.760
 and this is the way it was like that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.250
 type ties 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.010
 another very simple way in which 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.380
 we can take it is we take the scarf and 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.510
 we throw it back 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.910
 we take one of the tips and throw it 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.890
 forward to the opposite side and the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.710
 another one we are also forward 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.350
 towards the opposite side and we take a 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.420
 little bit this is right is one of my 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.730
 favorite way to use it when you do 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 cold is very good for the winter 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.540
 what to do this is that it protects here 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.900
 the throat and so you also carry a 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.299
 Very nice style with your scarf 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.430
 another way is that we can take the 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.799
 scarf we put here wool more 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.659
 backwards in the back what 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.000
 let's do is cross it and then 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.340
 take it again forward we go 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.590
 to talk a little here and we're going to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.250
 do after taking this tip here 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.260
 and not to pass it totally and we are going to form 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 as if it were a bun in this part 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.739
 then I'm going to take the other tip and I'm going 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.010
 to go through the hole that we already had and 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.080
 that's what it looks like after we finish 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.879
 and also in this way that I'm going to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.769
 teaching is super simple only 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.930
 we take the scarf we put it from 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.150
 back and what we're going to do is first 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.510
 we are going to give it a cross like that and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.489
 the wings back then again the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.650
 we crossed and launched the remaining east 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.840
 What I'm going to do next is talk 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.150
 little here what we had already formed 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 I'm going to pull the hair so it does not 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.739
 bother you can put a little bit 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.629
 tips here below this style too 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.489
 It's very good for those days when he does 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.799
 very cold because this area protects us 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.049
 of the throat and goes very well with his 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.090
 super big friends that are used in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.099
 countries where it is also very cold 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.200
 I hope you liked all the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.030
 styles and if they like how I told them in
