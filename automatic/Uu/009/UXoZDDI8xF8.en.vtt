00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 I would not fit in my head that a game 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 has been in the market for more than 16 years 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.569
 they can have such a weak security 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.910
 for your users 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.860
 today they planned to upload a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 video related to the killer fit and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 its addons since I had the most 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.529
 of the material recorded since a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 back then I just lacked 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.160
 Marian aggravate access so 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.930
 after several months he returned to enter 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.580
 my character to find that my 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.740
 set that cost me a lot of time and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 effort valued roughly in about 3 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.640
 millions of gold pieces are not 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 I found it in its place and that my account 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 bank did not have the amount of gold that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 I left him the last time of course this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.420
 I was not surprised 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.550
 in fact I must say that I expected it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 but here's where the worrying thing is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 it is sad that the biblical community 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 if it is still part mixed to it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's be used to that security 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 of our accounts is violated with 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 ease although it is true that we have 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 the recovery key that is the key 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 what they give you when you create an account 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 with which you can recover it in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.379
 case of a robbery we do not have the time 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.850
 Enough to be like nannies 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 waiting for someone to enter our 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 account to use the aforementioned key 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.549
 most of the time we enter the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 account and the items are no longer found 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.039
 in her 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.240
 I can bet what you want to 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.770
 that most of those who are me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.899
 watching in this video has happened in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.149
 some time and they understand me the most 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.619
 worrying is that certainly sir soft 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.600
 does not offer an accessible way of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 keep yourself protected just the fact 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 that they charge you real money for changing 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.090
 the name of your account would put in cloth 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 of judgment the love that is supposed to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 executives of the game have their audience 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.439
 in other games, change the name to your 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 account is free lately has it 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 asked how it is that you check a 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.929
 account since before or at least what 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.509
 that I remember if you were a player of the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.369
 easy life is to say if you used bots 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.500
 macros or multi client ran the risk 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 of being hacked because by those 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 programs the hackers and is that we can 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 call them that way they took your account 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 using a keylogger you have more than 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 a program that registers the keys that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.259
 you touch even the last time you reach 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.119
 see one in action you could see the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.459
 victim's desk and close their 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.009
 Will programs sound very pro 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.689
 truth is not so much if you that you're 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.369
 watching you want to do it you can do it 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.739
 looking for a tutorial on the internet or 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.720
 even here on youtube and just 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.459
 cases of 12- year-old children who do 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.410
 fast and easy as 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.540
 it's certainly nothing 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.370
 proof that immature people can 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 achieve this type of acts is the fact of 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.450
 that often take your account 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.550
 only for leisure and throw objects 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.350
 to the diphoto to a river so that they pass to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.570
 directly affect the player in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.640
 a matter of time and effort without a 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.030
 real reason or at least reasonable 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.070
 then seen all this you think that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.560
 could do something ship shop to improve 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.420
 your safety sincerely do you think that the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880
 game safety is fine as well as 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.440
 it is currently certainly this 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.330
 video is not made with the intention of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.610
 offend only I want to express to 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.950
 respect since it is such a usual subject 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.020
 in the community that we take it for granted and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
 It should not be that way too, I have to 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.790
 clarify that it is not the first time that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.350
 this happens or will it be the last 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 unfortunately as we want to see you 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.070
 the next week in a warm video 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.020
 I'll be all week trying 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.930
 retrieve the items from my character to 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.280
 be able to bring videos more easily 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.200
 Excuse me if this lukewarm video was not 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 what they expected with the edition 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.520
 stories and others I suppose in some 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380
 aspects in regard to warm 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.510
 we must be used to expect what 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.340
 worse for today is all remember that my 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.110
 links you find them in the description 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.750
 and that your comments are welcome 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.879
 until after you have a good day 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.680
 late or good night and do not steal them 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.680
