00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
can explain it it sends all your data

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.029 
can explain it it sends all your data
just<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> move<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.239> controller

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
just say when you move your controller

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.349 
just say when you move your controller
to<00:00:56.039> another<00:00:56.670> giant<00:00:57.360> pc<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.359> records

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to another giant pc which then records

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.260 
to another giant pc which then records
the<00:01:00.600> screen<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.680> us<00:01:01.770> onto<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.370> PC<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the screen and put us onto your PC I

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
the screen and put us onto your PC I
know<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.260> doesn't<00:01:04.650> work<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.700> bunch

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
know it doesn't work like that a bunch

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
know it doesn't work like that a bunch
trying<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> explain<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.229> people<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:08.070> actually

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
trying to explain to people how actually

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
trying to explain to people how actually

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
works are know a lot of people who

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
works are know a lot of people who
actually<00:01:10.979> can't<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:12.030> how<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> works<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
actually can't think how it works but it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
actually can't think how it works but it
is<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:14.010> works<00:01:14.340> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is actually how it actually works just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
is actually how it actually works just
say<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> TV<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> you've<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
say if you have a TV and you've got the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.240 
say if you have a TV and you've got the
onlive<00:01:17.310> box<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
onlive box what you do is is on that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
onlive box what you do is is on that
online<00:01:20.490> box<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.450> connects<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> internet

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
online box it connects to the internet

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
online box it connects to the internet
you<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.030> least<00:01:24.060> two<00:01:24.479> Meg<00:01:24.720> or

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you have to have at least two Meg or

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
you have to have at least two Meg or
above<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.200> most<00:01:25.799> English<00:01:26.310> people<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
above which most English people have

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.289 
above which most English people have
temec<00:01:27.270> most<00:01:28.140> American<00:01:28.650> people<00:01:28.920> f7<00:01:29.369> Meg<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
temec most American people f7 Meg so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.950 
temec most American people f7 Meg so
it's<00:01:30.479> fine<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.409> anyway<00:01:32.119> what<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> does<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it's fine but anyway what it does is is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's fine but anyway what it does is is
it<00:01:34.409> connects<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> internet<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it connects to the internet and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
it connects to the internet and
obviously<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.290> controller<00:01:37.979> connects<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
obviously your controller connects to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.690 
obviously your controller connects to
the<00:01:38.700> box<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.350> what<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.530> does<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.369> just

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the box and what that does is is just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100 
the box and what that does is is just
say<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> connect<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> internet

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
say when you connect to the internet

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
say when you connect to the internet
you're<00:01:43.380> connecting<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.130> server<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you're connecting to their server and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
you're connecting to their server and
when<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> connect<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> server<00:01:47.149> you're

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
when you connect to this server you're

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.600 
when you connect to this server you're
basically<00:01:48.390> connecting<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> giant<00:01:50.189> massive

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
basically connecting to a giant massive

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
basically connecting to a giant massive
pc<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.720> crunches<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.649> games<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
pc that crunches all your games for you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
pc that crunches all your games for you
and<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> does<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.350> relays<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:57.079> video

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and when it does it then relays a video

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
and when it does it then relays a video
stream<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.799> TV<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.119> you're

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
stream to your TV to see what you're

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.170 
stream to your TV to see what you're
actually<00:02:00.509> playing<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.549> say<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
actually playing so just say if you go
