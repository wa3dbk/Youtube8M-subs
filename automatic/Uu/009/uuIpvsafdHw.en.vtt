custom<00:06:10.330> work<00:06:10.360> install<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.139> flag<00:06:11.409> on<00:06:11.620> there<00:06:11.830> and

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:12.689 
custom work install a flag on there and

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.059 
custom work install a flag on there and
that's<00:06:13.689> a<00:06:13.779> three-dimensional<00:06:14.379> flag<00:06:14.649> I<00:06:14.860> think

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
that's a three-dimensional flag I think

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.800 
that's a three-dimensional flag I think
it's<00:06:15.189> put<00:06:15.370> on<00:06:15.430> styrene<00:06:16.000> because<00:06:16.479> of<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:16.629> real

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
it's put on styrene because of the real

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.139 
it's put on styrene because of the real
model<00:06:17.139> or<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:18.099> real<00:06:18.279> prototype<00:06:18.669> has<00:06:19.120> a

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.149 
model or the real prototype has a

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.659 
model or the real prototype has a
three-dimensional<00:06:19.839> flag<00:06:20.050> it's<00:06:20.949> not<00:06:21.189> painted

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
three-dimensional flag it's not painted

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.209 
three-dimensional flag it's not painted
on<00:06:21.819> to<00:06:21.939> the<00:06:22.029> actual<00:06:22.300> car<00:06:22.569> it<00:06:22.899> is<00:06:23.219> a

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 
on to the actual car it is a

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.550 
on to the actual car it is a
three-dimensional<00:06:25.120> piece<00:06:25.689> and<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.259> wanted

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
three-dimensional piece and I wanted

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.860 
three-dimensional piece and I wanted
that<00:06:27.149> represented<00:06:28.149> correctly<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.629> he<00:06:28.719> did

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
that represented correctly and he did

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.420 
that represented correctly and he did
that<00:06:28.990> for<00:06:29.229> me<00:06:29.259> put<00:06:29.649> Jim<00:06:29.860> Adams<00:06:30.039> on<00:06:30.279> there

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
that for me put Jim Adams on there

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.550 
that for me put Jim Adams on there
because<00:06:30.699> that's<00:06:30.819> the<00:06:30.969> car<00:06:31.210> it<00:06:31.330> is<00:06:31.960> supposed<00:06:32.469> to

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
because that's the car it is supposed to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.480 
because that's the car it is supposed to
model<00:06:32.979> and<00:06:33.339> also<00:06:34.080> I<00:06:35.080> know<00:06:35.769> a<00:06:35.860> lot<00:06:36.009> of<00:06:36.039> you<00:06:36.250> who

buff's<00:06:37.210> know<00:06:37.570> that<00:06:38.230> the<00:06:38.440> yupi<00:06:38.830> tender<00:06:39.250> is<00:06:39.370> a

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
buff's know that the yupi tender is a

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.590 
buff's know that the yupi tender is a
little<00:06:39.640> different<00:06:40.000> in<00:06:40.120> shape

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
little different in shape

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.510 
little different in shape
nobody's<00:06:41.080> accurately<00:06:41.650> done<00:06:41.800> that<00:06:41.980> so<00:06:42.250> I<00:06:42.280> had
