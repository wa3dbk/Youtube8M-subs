 Hi guys, how are you? I'm a fan. It's the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.120
 blagnac corner of teaching 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 I'm here to record the second 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 episode of the tutorial series for 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 plays the sims 2 and uses content 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.760
 custom out I had 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 I'll try to be brief so I do not stay a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 very long video 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 in the field today to teach and how to install 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.579
 custom content a deviation of 2 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.219
 there are two ways to install content 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 Conditional 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.989
 and that is the use that is with a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 little problem senate that 12 pec who 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 scale is what I'll leave the link to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.160
 download there in the blog then people 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 when you create an end in the studio of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.750
 creation and packaging it will appear in the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.300
 work area in that right format 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.399
 when you lower a lot to sin and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.010
 extra it is also in this format 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.680
 good it is to install very simple to click two 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.200
 times on top of the file it will open 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
 these coach who is of their own destiny 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 you click on install your sim will be 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 installed inside your rate 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 downloads side game 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 if you have not a page 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.610
 downloads create ok now let's go to fame 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 I do not climb the contents 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 that it is with a program that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 have you previously called 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.799
 two tech klinz to apply to the far you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 found there on the blog or you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.240
 ask why I use this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.329
 program and not on the game scale 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.670
 People I use this program is good to have 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.220
 better control over downloads 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 to keep my folder organized 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.439
 and avoid certain errors in the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.759
 instillation know I'll show you 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.970
 now you will understand what I am 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.970
 Speaking 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.280
 the installation is also very simple and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.580
 follows the same line as the other 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.800
 you stay twice on top of the file 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.660
 He's going to open this little hockey pane. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.210
 You will see that it is completely 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 different from the other because you can see 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.480
 every pound that is attached to a bundle 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:37.510
 who is there will install it inside the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:40.300
 download store fee 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 how all my things are 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.920
 placed inside folders 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.060
 now without wasting time let's go to the lot that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.459
 It is a little different but we are this 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.840
 way to avoid possible mistakes and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.800
 ensure that it will appear on the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:24.400
 batch catalog ok then when you 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:29.640
 download a file or extract are you have 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 a folder with files needed picks 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.950
 the lot gets it and puts it in there 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.330
 of your download page 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.190
 I already occupied the files folder. 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.570
 required into the my 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.910
 downloads page 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.769
 now they will install hate the same thing 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.130
 you double-click on top of that 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.150
 file and will open this window 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.310
 now attention when you went there 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.870
 install select this here 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.550
 There is that word but that's it and 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.430
 select and select the download folder that 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.620
 that's where he's staying and that's where you 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.840
 put bales 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:17.209
 If you want you can even choose the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 the folder you want to install loch o 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.950
 but in the case it is that you put to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.240
 seek to bring into the folder 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.560
 downloads 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.990
 I'm going to let it loose and inside 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.110
 download page even though it is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:35.419
 But it did not end there, you go. 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:39.680
 you need to re-install only the 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.320
 lot only selects the box that is 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.790
 to ensure that it will appear on your 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:51.380
 batch catalog does not affect the area of the 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.660
 The way you 're installing, okay? Okay? 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.000
 finally I'll talk about clothes 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.070
 hair and stir 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.990
 so let's go to a lot of people 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.539
 difficulty with mexico 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.850
 What is this annoying thing that prevents 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.700
 my custom content 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.919
 appeared a game well people stir is the 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.340
 shape of object 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.210
 I would describe it as a sculpture 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.479
 White is well that we move as 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.910
 was a white sculpture and the records 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.150
 generally what we lose without 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.289
 Move is what gives body is what gives coast 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.479
 white sculpture is the stir is what gives 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.539
 new ways to play 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.600
 that's just it and it's very important 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:42.080
 clothes and hair even simpler you 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.510
 download the extracted file and put the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.229
 files that are extracted into the 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.780
 downloads have no requirement is just that 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.180
