also<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> be

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
also what do you think it's going to be

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.230 
also what do you think it's going to be
named<00:00:22.670> personally<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
named personally I think it's going to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.390 
named personally I think it's going to
be<00:00:24.300> named<00:00:24.539> links<00:00:25.109> since<00:00:25.529> those<00:00:25.830> trademarks

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
be named links since those trademarks

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.490 
be named links since those trademarks
have<00:00:26.519> already<00:00:26.730> been<00:00:26.880> purchased<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.289> think

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
have already been purchased and I think

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
have already been purchased and I think
blinks<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:28.980> probably<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> good<00:00:29.490> name<00:00:29.789> but

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
blinks would probably be a good name but

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
blinks would probably be a good name but
you<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:31.500> really

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have to drag it all in there again so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
have to drag it all in there again so
I'd<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.030> system<00:01:33.360> could<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
I'd like it if the system could do that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
I'd like it if the system could do that
by<00:01:34.020> itself<00:01:34.409> without<00:01:34.770> those<00:01:35.130> problems<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> the
