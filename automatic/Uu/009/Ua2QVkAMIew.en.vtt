00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.170
 when they told us that the experience 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.940
 It was submersible that resisted the water 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.500
 we say now let's take it one day 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.580
 everyday we are going to take the flower 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.289
 and let's water the grass 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.000
 let's use it as a little table for 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.100
 disperse the water because surely in 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.480
 an experience can disperse a 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.429
 little better among the masters to live 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.769
 the jet of half we are also of 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.419
 new started simply question of 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.949
 use it to get the water to 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.480
 everywhere because we throw out there to 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.640
 side a rock and we started to use 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.079
 to disperse but in the distance we 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.370
 we said good let's go for a while we go 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.440
 to mess it up a bit in getting a 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.270
 little bit of grass throw us a little 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.740
 land out there also in total and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 after it is a cistern is cleaned let's go 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.760
 play a while with expedientar recipe 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.860
 then we totally wash it is very 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.140
 easy we directly fit jet 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.460
 water over and the problem that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.440
 can we both say good we go 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.880
 in finish with homework hands 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.070
 that was a dirty dishes and things of the day 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.990
 Yesterday's dinner yesterday and we put 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.210
 clean all the cutlery we are going to put 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.370
 a little bit of argente in itself and more such not 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 he's all ready with those glasses 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 things that were not dirty we cleaned it 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 we use the step as a backlight in 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.810
 the total tablet this bar where 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 needs from below is copado we go to 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.200
 clean your hands and then we're going to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.360
 clean up what we have left 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.799
 from the tablet of papers to how is the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.840
 foam we will be a little bit more 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.759
 near all the excess things 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.899
 they came after so much hard work 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.060
 we said good let's remember some 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.710
 young we are going to grab about three with 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 they are going to cut one half of the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.189
 board and do not scratch with gondra stone and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 follow the problem we are going to open 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.939
 one by one we cut there the second 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 we'll finish cutting there 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.619
 we finished with the second grapefruit we are going to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 grab the third by milo and the last 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.050
 we do not cut it above this nor 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.880
 xperia is ready 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.440
 and after opening the grapefruit which is what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 what are we going to do, gentlemen and obviously 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.740
 we will make our table so 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.990
 now let's quickly write everything 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.450
 the juice and we will see that after 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 squeeze all three grapefruits that we 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.050
 they were left six half room you have to throw 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.790
 directly the juice by the expert 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.490
 talk et cetera and we are going to fill all the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.750
 glass with the juice ignore all the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.100
 game that is running away for me 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.690
 outside because good obviously is 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
 impossible to put it inside but 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 look at I can do all the things of 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.610
 all day with the experience is worth z 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.060
 I never told him this we go a little bit more 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.860
 to see if you can lower the juice a little 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 of the pulp then obviously I took 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.250
 all the juice because they thought that we 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 forced to take if it was good then to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.400
 end of the day we said well let's 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.200
 give us a bath relaxing a bath 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
 foam then we throw in the bathroom 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.590
 foam then we take out the paid 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.600
 obviously because the tablet can not be 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.340
 stay there wandering all day in the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.160
 bathtub and we see that at the end of the day 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.050
 works perfectly fine without minutes 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570
