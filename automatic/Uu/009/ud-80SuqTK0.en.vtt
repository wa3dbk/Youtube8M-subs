00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello welcome are like in this video 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.639
 I'm going to teach you how to make such claws 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.920
 fun how are you can use them 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.900
 to play with your friends to go 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 with a good costume for what you want 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.710
 you know that the result is very good as well 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.509
 let's see how we can do them 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.820
 what we are going to need is a sheet 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.259
 normal of all life din a4 me in this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.660
 case I am a green but obviously 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.769
 you can use a white one without problems and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.079
 then also use a pencil to 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.430
 ticking the folds to start 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.290
 we're going to have to double any of 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.720
 the four corners to the other side 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.070
 here and make sure it looks good 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 bent and not quiet and the tip is left 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.039
 here perfectly bent 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.100
 we have here how we doubled it and then 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.750
 we mark the rest of the paper 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 because we have this what I'm going to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.890
 do is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.100
 mark with him 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.350
 with the pencil and improve the fold and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 now we take this tip from here up 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.089
 and we bend it in and what 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.000
 we take to the other corner of such 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.330
 so that we have a kind of house 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 like this one 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.120
 here we see that the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 fold we go over it a bit 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.930
 once we have this kind of house the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.250
 base what we 're going to do is fold it 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.470
 inward 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.569
 we take double 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.569
 [Music] 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.000
 here we have one and we do the same with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.990
 the other side 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990
 and we double up 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.000
 as we go doing 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.330
 Folds as we go bending 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.440
 the paper will not be costing better now 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.260
 next what we are going to do is 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.970
 once we have this form this part the 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.350
 let's put it just above so 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.800
 We are going to use these lashes 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.620
 hide 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.050
 we take here 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.330
 and we take it up we see that 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.920
 fits well and now what I'm going to do 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.810
 is to re-emphasize everything with the pencil 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.210
 I repeat what you can do with the pencil or 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.909
 with what you prefer a rule 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.789
 it would also serve 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.160
 once we have done this we see here 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.580
 what is left this flat part what we are going 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.410
 to do is to fold in here already 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.569
 it's going to cost a lot more to double this 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.379
 that we are going to do it with care 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.379
 we come to the other corner 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 up to this point 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.760
 and little by little we doubled to the point 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.290
 this triangle must remain but 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.720
 Now what we are going to do is go back to 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.610
 open the fold that we just made and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.930
 the corner this right we're going to 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.940
 bend inward in such a way that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.520
 is touching this line people from 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.270
 center that we have made 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.270
 and we are going to do 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.960
 we take like this 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.780
 and as we see 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 we have done the previous fold of this 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.490
 way and I'll go over it with the pencil 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.530
 so that later it will be easier 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.420
 we have this form of agreement what 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.860
 we have to do is fold the tab 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.450
 is bigger than we have towards 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.960
 inside therefore above the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.960
 that we had 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.750
 in this way 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.750
 in agreement we mark the fold 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.620
 and we turn it over and fold it again 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.330
 towards us in this case when 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.830
 we bend instead of bending straight what 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.260
 let's do is fold with us 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.390
 from this area here in such a way that 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.210
 we will stay 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.610
 practically the claw made here already what 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.610
 we have we will finish marking everything 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.690
 and now we only need one step that 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.220
 it will be a little more complicated and we have 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.470
 to force a bit the paper that is 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.440
 to put this tab here within 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.180
 this opening that we have here is worth 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 we can open it a bit with your finger 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.240
 and then what I recommend is that 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.150
 double 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.010
 inward in this way once 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.959
 we mark here 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.700
 we mark this a little bit and then 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.640
 it was much easier 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.430
 enter it inside the package as 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.980
 we see here we have this gap here and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 what we do is introduce this 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.280
 way 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.620
 once we have introduced it 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.380
 we re-emphasize 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.669
 and we will have our claw done in 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.020
 this case what we have to do is 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.830
 put 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.650
 our finger where we want 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.140
 we open here and we have to open the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.030
 figure that we have been tightening it and 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.150
 Carefully you are making a hole 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.480
 until you can enter the finger that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.480
 you want 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.370
 and we have 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.370
 we have made our claw 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.460
 good and here we have the result already 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.770
 had taught at the beginning of the video 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.729
 how are these claws in this case I 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.380
 what I have done that did not fit me 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.060
 well the finger is cut this area of 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.740
 here so you can enter well from 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.770
 agreement so you can fold well 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.030
 the fingers and nothing evidently in 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.069
 function of the number of fingers that 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.470
 you want what you want to do then you will do 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.210
 more or less amount of claws as you see 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.740
 They are quite tough only 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.229
 I do not know what it is to go anybody anymore 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.610
 that even if it's paper, the tip can 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.830
 get to hurt you so do not use it 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.979
 to hit anyone because I think that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.300
 it can hurt and nothing 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.680
 I hope we hope very much that I have 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.810
 liked or if you liked it please 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.550
 subscribe to our channel and any 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.960
 thing you doubt or what you want us to do 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.460
 can some comments that we 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.220
 we appreciate any comments 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.560
 that you agree with us so nothing 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.789
 thank you very much and until the next 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.789
 video until then
