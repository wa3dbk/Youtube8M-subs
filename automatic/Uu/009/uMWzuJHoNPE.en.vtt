00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.240
 I never believed in the fact that I could 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.240
 exist life beyond the earth 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.170
 but days ago those were answered 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.170
 questions that I never asked 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 I lost my house 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.910
 I have lost a friend 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.910
 I have lost my dignity 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.280
 and I'm losing my sanity 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.430
 yes 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.869
 one 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.810
 I never imagined I could get to 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.820
 this point running by my own 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.670
 survival and taking refuge in cabins 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.010
 abandoned had not eaten since 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.980
 three days but that day I saw one 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.090
 opportunity that should not miss that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.430
 day 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.000
 I would eat deer 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.000
 much 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.910
 I have you corral small side surrender no 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 you have nothing to lose your parents 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 Now that I think about it, I live nothing is 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.050
 a week in fact this talking cairn 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.980
 is looking for your son for me are you 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.980
 how much have you grown 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.579
 no, I do not think that's how you do not have anything 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.579
 lose good 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.640
 and now as low 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.590
 after becoming a murderer 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.989
 cold blood I decided to return to my only 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.810
 refuge to enjoy my food but I 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.090
 I found the cabin with a big surprise 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.890
 the number of questions was no longer 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 that came to my mind would not prevent 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.150
 I ate what I had gotten 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.970
 good good good good well you want a little 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.970
 little cow 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.720

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.880

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.930

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:00.280

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.280
