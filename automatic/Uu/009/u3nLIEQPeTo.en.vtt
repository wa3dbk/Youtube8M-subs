00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.170
 stood up for theo janssen dances that was also with black ops two years ago 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.910
 last year this month of August the opportunity is offered for chance 2 on the same 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.469
 location have just played more than 3 live the multiplayer 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.580
 but I have I come there anyway I think that was nice 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.730
 yes we are busy has not even started yet we actually have one of them 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.350
 the biggest advantage of being able to tackle games financially 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490
 yes it started with achievement and in it 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.899
 they came with a trailer 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.899
 and about 50 south of Poland 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.480
 when the movable mt yes that is that feeling we really had and then we 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.869
 to the associations 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.360
 because it can't help but your dad back anp 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.330
 aptroot who readers on Tuesday just like the czech 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.060
 Mexico 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.479
 pascalle team and that gives you up respect special picture is the knmi in the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.570
 Bilt is It is of course the book can make things worse 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.369
 just as a goal 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.020
 making big leaps is therefore not entirely because it is perspective 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.170
 not really of a different order 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.979
 a lot i liked then that is not only in the air you can also do the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.560
 cashier 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.280
 breda a butt by the jury he watched by tjeren the other on the side 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.560
 band members didulica seems to succeed in an arm fracture makes the latter clear 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.439
 One of them went by accident so it's a freaky thing to go to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.060
 followers mothers away 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.960
 at the trailer it looked very easy that you also understand 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.919
 to add a gas turbine that he was chased by a very often approached 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:13.069
 I think it is a bit of a backwind to even more yes it is not 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.260
 so that you succeed with you and that you turn out whether an apartment building a gas leak 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 theo janssen 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.199
 so there is a show oi 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:23.379
 enjoy military resources other things that more and more brands have taken over 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.930
 of fierce ticket and system now I have a 13th century 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.799
 10 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.150
 and they still have the turn 3 3 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.870
 say the club can return a lot of well-known camps and besides the fairs Thursday 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 exodus it is the first player of the kids in a certain way you can 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.830
 Here those users can for example 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.240
 too crazy to break acid in a valve 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.500
 whether from a clock king or a spin off there will also be extra life or a tropical one 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.710
 storm center in buildings and that costs energy and there was a lot too 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.709
 once a lot of bourgeus makes to gent is this meets your life 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.569
 the public and the know 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.709
 In addition, you also have the purser, he thinks 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.019
 the 46th stock market can do on 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.169
 I don't have it on both exoskeleton now 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.820
 samendes and texts normally 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.900
 with the new 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.080
 like you also kind of the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.819
 kind of dreaming 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.249
 here is a unique look and the enemy what I rouvoet myself, it is simple 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.929
 the man must also have a grenade tossed by the public 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 business consists of the company 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.759
 and whatever I want you to be and stay with something deeper 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.539
 and you can walk 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.539
 it's the nicest bob killstreaks you now also have phil vedett lager ups 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:36.209
 communicated 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.489
 repels cor snare 6 that was 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.949
 so we now have the suspension are in return 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.849
 and m that I find good news in itself I'm really someone who goes for the 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.629
 objects it is not for the guys of course but also for the mauritz rails 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.199
 each other variants acid as a supervisor before we often miss it is that one time 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.879
 not on 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.250
 of course when you die paper 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.159
 The nice thing about this is that things are following customizing 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.569
 Jessica You Can Do It With Qredits You Can For example By Checking The Provider 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.339
 for example a roccuzzo from the left to energy corner nani or that you can get rid of me 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.819
 then pull along with sailing and in dokkum you can do that with practicality 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.739
 the suspension is you can do that 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.289
 and that really seems very interesting compared to the order studied from the suspension 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.819
 act against the first team politics but also that you now gorssel 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.800
 determined in which order way 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.919
 how many good directions 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.710
 you can do for me 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080
 good luck 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.570
 the suspension Sinterklaas 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.570
 but the brief consultation with both should be on his side 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.569
 14 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.569
 because 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.629
 even in the sand, for example, if you moorburg employer's chairman is rejected 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.059
 then the pan already with me 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:49.379
 gets into the red light district and because of that a suspension and then I dare to 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.549
 limit and soldiers yes then we get it down to both points 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 imagine 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.069
 not so much trouble to do it is not good then 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.360
 he also wants to be clean 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.099
 do you know what it is like to be one so he said it was a lot of land and 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.099
 property decree from oath that guest names come 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.409
 in short Jan you played out and restrained play what did you think of it 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.300
 but I liked it more, it feels very fresh and new 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.330
 9 I thought it was also convinced four completely different brands 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.000
 he did and what i still have a fashion a hefty new build that is just 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.660
 poured out 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.850
 the manageress balls have led ball it is kind and there is kind 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.650
 satellite ball and you have to grab it and it is hoped that you get a suit 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.629
 don't shoot people with spots 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.090
 and you have to do that in a sort of sorting that you can do 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.789
 throw on the ring or you can even jump in if you are all that 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.559
 the opposite is that left and then you get goals yes if you have that ball too 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.909
 throw out to the man's family if he can't shoot then you can never go down again 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.199
 I shoot that we are not opponents I have this 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.620
 don't show up so well now and nobody could 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.900
 the head comes from 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.950
 but I think that in the end a whole game of awards will be asked and what 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.199
 I also want to say if I have the idea that also want some more back 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.210
 are going to choose tomtom, the largest firmament at the sports facilities saab 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.249
 and you can now all largely back yes 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.249
 in short wear speed 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:15.469
 Many the big plans with the multiplayer of call of duty make the answer look good 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.029
 listened to the rank and file 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.240
 well listened to the followers and those ex the games played a woman one 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.689
 and a good addition, I think 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:26.820
 I have a little sauce to refresh 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.450
 about the call of duty fans right here I just need better 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.710
 what works 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.969
 after my first participation messed up there must be what you want 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.969
 after the shelves 7 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.979
 virtuoso vacation with a pencil 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:49.809
 on the exhibition floors
