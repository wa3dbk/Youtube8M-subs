00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
you get added to your school but there's

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.880 
you get added to your school but there's
definitely<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.750> balance<00:02:02.110> between<00:02:02.229> getting<00:02:02.709> a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
definitely a balance between getting a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.430 
definitely a balance between getting a
good<00:02:03.129> time<00:02:03.369> multiplier<00:02:03.849> and<00:02:04.259> getting<00:02:05.259> enough

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
good time multiplier and getting enough

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.940 
good time multiplier and getting enough
points<00:02:05.649> in<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.950> level<00:02:06.160> when<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.369> finish<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
points in the level when you finish so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.499 
points in the level when you finish so
you<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.129> see<00:02:09.280> here<00:02:09.459> Jules<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:09.970> activated<00:02:10.450> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
you can see here Jules just activated a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.670 
you can see here Jules just activated a
bunch<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> time<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.080> pick<00:02:11.230> ups<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.500> time

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
bunch of time to pick ups the time

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080 
bunch of time to pick ups the time
pickups<00:02:12.040> are<00:02:12.190> worth<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.550> lot<00:02:12.580> more<00:02:12.790> than

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
pickups are worth a lot more than

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.280 
pickups are worth a lot more than
regular<00:02:13.239> pickup<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:13.780> he's<00:02:13.930> backtracking

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
regular pickup so he's backtracking

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.600 
regular pickup so he's backtracking
across<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.890> bridge<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.099> pick<00:02:15.400> those<00:02:15.580> up

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
across the bridge to pick those up

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.860 
across the bridge to pick those up
because<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.090> very<00:02:16.239> important<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.599> get<00:02:16.780> his

because it's very important to get his

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.360 
because it's very important to get his
score<00:02:17.110> higher<00:02:17.319> before<00:02:17.530> he<00:02:17.739> crosses<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.099> next

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370

advanced players know that you can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.610 
advanced players know that you can
actually<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.810> multiplier<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.500> up

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
actually get this multiplier going up

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.170 
actually get this multiplier going up
higher<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.130> kill<00:02:40.370> more<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.610> them<00:02:40.880> so

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
higher if you kill more of them so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.240 
higher if you kill more of them so

dyeing and dyeing a lot which is really
important<00:03:16.640> there's<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.660> gallery<00:03:18.020> here<00:03:18.230> you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
important there's a gallery here you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.990 
important there's a gallery here you
haven't<00:03:18.680> noticed<00:03:18.950> it's<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.670> one<00:03:19.760> thing<00:03:19.880> I

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
haven't noticed it's the one thing I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
haven't noticed it's the one thing I
didn't<00:03:20.239> have<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.510> didn't<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> lot<00:03:20.959> of

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
didn't have to I didn't have a lot of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.449 
didn't have to I didn't have a lot of
people<00:03:21.290> through<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.650> does<00:03:21.830> add<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> lot<00:03:22.340> of

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
people through it does add a lot of

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.699 
people through it does add a lot of
pressure<00:03:22.700> now<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.930> critical

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
pressure now we go to the critical

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.940 
pressure now we go to the critical
endgame<00:03:25.489> here<00:03:25.520> or<00:03:26.680> you've<00:03:27.680> got<00:03:27.860> your

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
endgame here or you've got your

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.640 
endgame here or you've got your
multiplier<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.459> 27<00:03:29.320> don't<00:03:30.320> get<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.500> pretty

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
multiplier up to 27 don't get it pretty

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.020 
multiplier up to 27 don't get it pretty
high<00:03:30.830> on<00:03:30.860> this<00:03:31.070> last<00:03:31.250> section<00:03:31.459> pretty<00:03:31.820> sure<00:03:32.000> I

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
high on this last section pretty sure I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.030 
high on this last section pretty sure I
finish<00:03:32.360> this<00:03:32.390> level<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> 38<00:03:33.350> multiplayer

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
finish this level with a 38 multiplayer

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.340 
finish this level with a 38 multiplayer
I<00:03:34.280> think<00:03:34.790> my<00:03:34.880> time<00:03:35.090> bonus<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.450> one<00:03:35.630> point<00:03:35.780> on<00:03:36.049> it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
I think my time bonus is one point on it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.650 
I think my time bonus is one point on it
on<00:03:36.709> us<00:03:36.799> right<00:03:36.920> now<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.160> 2.3<00:03:37.640> are<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.420> killing

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
air crate that probably would've taken

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.280 
air crate that probably would've taken
care<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.450> air<00:04:17.570> creator<00:04:17.900> if<00:04:18.019> you'd<00:04:18.140> gone

care of the air creator if you'd gone
across<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.859> bridge<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.190> little<00:04:19.400> bit<00:04:19.489> more

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
across that bridge a little bit more

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:20.800 
across that bridge a little bit more
quickly<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.359> one<00:04:20.540> thing<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.750> do

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
quickly this is one thing I do

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.270 
quickly this is one thing I do
differently<00:04:21.200> from<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.709> across<00:04:21.950> that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
differently from you going across that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.740 
differently from you going across that
narrow<00:04:22.490> ledge<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:22.940> actually<00:04:23.120> boost<00:04:23.540> jump

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
narrow ledge I actually boost jump

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.180 
narrow ledge I actually boost jump
across<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.140> whole<00:04:24.410> thing<00:04:24.620> that's<00:04:24.830> reasoning

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
across the whole thing that's reasoning

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.400 
across the whole thing that's reasoning
anybody<00:04:25.520> because<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:25.910> might<00:04:26.060> lose<00:04:26.240> one<00:04:26.510> okay

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
well that about wraps it up hopefully
