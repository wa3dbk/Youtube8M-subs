00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.310
If you were playing Sim City, you’d want
to go about building your metropolis the same

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.710
way the Saudi’s have with King Abdullah
Economic City.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.429
And just like other great leaders of men,
you’d probably name it after yourself too,

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.469
which is exactly what King Abdullah did.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.910
You’d also focus on job-creating infrastructure
and a dream university to attract the best

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.080
and brightest.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.290
Saudi Arabia is the world’s dominant oil
producer, and is a country that knows how

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.960
to play the game.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.750
While its flashier neighbors like Abu Dhabi
and Dubai get all the publicity for their

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.700
megaprojects, the Kingdom is embarking on
a far more ambitious project that’s focused

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.680
squarely on creating the most cohesive, well-planned
city in the Arab world.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.160
The $100 billion enterprise on the coast of
the Red Sea is about an hour’s drive north

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.350
of Jeddah, the second-largest city in Saudi
Arabia, and plans to expand into an area about

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.800
the size of Washington DC.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.670
That location is no coincidence, says Fahd
Al Rasheed, the man who’s in charge of growing

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.030
King Abdullah Economic City - which we’re
going to shorten to just its initials, KAEC

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.120
- “you’re talking about 24 percent of
global trade going through the Red Sea, and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.960
this is a trend that’s never been addressed
by a Red Sea port.”

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.990
That’s why KAEC’s port is going to be
massive, with an annual capacity of over ten

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.420
million shipping containers, which would make
it one of the busiest ports in the world.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.630
So cargo is KAEC’s first major transportation
hub.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
The second is Haramain station, one of four
stops on Saudi Arabia’s planned high speed

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.490
rail network that will connect the new megacity
to Jeddah, Makkah, and Madinah.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.969
This will bring thousands of visitors to KAEC
right from it’s inception, with officials

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.990
hoping that some will naturally take jobs
and stay there, fueling its expansion.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.799
At first, the whole plan struggled to gain
much traction with investors, “but,” says

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.219
Al Rasheed, “then we reoriented ourselves
towards building that demand, creating that

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.009
support and it’s completely shifted.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.979
Now we have captive demand — all our apartments
are full and we have waiting lists for hundreds

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.009
of people, literally.”

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.260
Part of that shift focused on KAEC’s Industrial
Valley which is centered on a large petrochemical

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.980
plant and has more than 70 companies lining
up to set up bases there.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.920
And then there’s the cornerstone of any
thriving city: a great university.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.189
Enter, King Abdullah University of Science
and Technology - which began instruction in

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.930
2009 with a staggering $20 billion endowment,
making it the third best-funded university

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.920
in the world behind Harvard and Yale.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.189
This capital injection has allowed it to lift
off like a rocket in its first five years.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.739
It’s recruited some of the best talent from
over 60 countries around the world--scientists

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.910
who’ve carried the school to an eye-opening
99.9% research record score.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.430
The research teams at King Tech are advancing
many important fields like solar cell technology

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.620
and cancer therapy.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.849
It teaches in English and is the first mixed-gender
university in the Kingdom.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.700
Plus, with just 1200 postgraduates on an 8,900
acre campus, there’s plenty of room to expand

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.480
in every direction.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.879
With forty percent of Saudi Arabia’s citizens
under 15 years old, the plan is for the megacity

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.569
- by itself - to create upwards of a million
jobs for all of those young people to grow

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.569
into.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.470
In the end, it may be true that Saudi Arabia
would be a bone-dry desert wasteland without

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.420
it’s exploitation of the vast fields of
black gold underneath it, but at least - in

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.640
the twilight of his life - King Abdullah is
doing all he can to set his people - and the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.249
rest of the world - on a slightly better path
than the one they were on when he took over

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.080
just nine years ago in 2005.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.849
And if that’s his legacy, he deserves to
have a city named after him.
