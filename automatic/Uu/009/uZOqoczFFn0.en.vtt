00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
have close okay so inside each package

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
have close okay so inside each package
you<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:29.699> belt<00:00:29.970> clip<00:00:30.210> toy<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
you get a little belt clip toy you get a
card<00:00:31.859> stickers<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
card stickers and then I think this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
card stickers and then I think this
piece<00:00:33.899> goes<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> rocket<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.100> think

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
piece goes to the rocket which I think

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.510 
piece goes to the rocket which I think
clips<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:36.079> right<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> back<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
