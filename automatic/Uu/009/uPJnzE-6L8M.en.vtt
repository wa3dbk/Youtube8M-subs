they're<00:00:22.750> super<00:00:22.990> rugged<00:00:23.289> yeah<00:00:24.100> see<00:00:24.280> what<00:00:24.400> the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
they're super rugged yeah see what the

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.430 
they're super rugged yeah see what the
old<00:00:24.520> spinning<00:00:25.119> disk<00:00:25.390> car<00:00:25.600> drives<00:00:25.840> I<00:00:26.110> was

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
old spinning disk car drives I was

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.529 
old spinning disk car drives I was
always<00:00:26.590> worried<00:00:26.920> about<00:00:26.980> losing<00:00:27.789> my<00:00:27.970> data<00:00:28.210> if<00:00:28.390> I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
always worried about losing my data if I

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.560 
always worried about losing my data if I
thought<00:00:29.080> my<00:00:29.170> laptop<00:00:29.500> oh<00:00:29.910> if<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.119> drop<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:31.449> like

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
thought my laptop oh if you drop it like

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.180 
thought my laptop oh if you drop it like
this<00:00:32.969> yep<00:00:33.969> oops<00:00:34.629> see<00:00:35.170> if<00:00:35.230> it<00:00:35.409> seems<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.069> work

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
this yep oops see if it seems to work

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.649 
this yep oops see if it seems to work
well<00:00:36.489> it's<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:36.850> good<00:00:36.940> thing<00:00:36.999> it's<00:00:37.210> got<00:00:37.359> an<00:00:37.449> intel

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
well it's a good thing it's got an intel

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.139 
well it's a good thing it's got an intel
SSD<00:00:38.079> inside<00:00:38.409> well<00:00:39.069> it<00:00:39.550> doesn't<00:00:39.670> look<00:00:39.879> like<00:00:39.969> the

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
SSD inside well it doesn't look like the

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.450 
SSD inside well it doesn't look like the
laptop<00:00:40.569> survive<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.199> drop<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:42.039> let's<00:00:42.280> see<00:00:42.399> if

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
laptop survive the drop so let's see if

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.160 
laptop survive the drop so let's see if
the<00:00:42.550> SSD<00:00:42.969> did<00:00:44.639> hear<00:00:45.639> you<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:46.780> let's<00:00:46.960> see<00:00:47.050> what

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
the SSD did hear you now let's see what

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.549 
the SSD did hear you now let's see what
we<00:00:47.260> got<00:00:47.379> Oh<00:00:50.789> looking<00:00:51.789> good<00:00:52.319> looks<00:00:53.319> like<00:00:53.440> your

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
we got Oh looking good looks like your

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.840 
we got Oh looking good looks like your
files<00:00:53.739> are<00:00:53.889> still<00:00:54.010> there<00:00:54.159> I<00:00:54.399> guess<00:00:54.729> this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
files are still there I guess this

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.729 
files are still there I guess this
brings<00:00:54.940> up<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.239> question<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:56.499> how<00:00:56.530> rugged

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
brings up the question just how rugged

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.869 
brings up the question just how rugged
are<00:00:56.920> these<00:00:57.039> solid<00:00:57.249> state<00:00:57.370> drives<00:00:57.579> they

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
are these solid state drives they

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.509 
are these solid state drives they
survived<00:00:58.209> the<00:00:58.359> hallway<00:00:58.629> drop<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.469> let's<00:01:00.190> see

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
survived the hallway drop so let's see

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.509 
survived the hallway drop so let's see
if<00:01:00.879> maybe<00:01:01.420> it'll<00:01:02.260> survive<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.829> drop<00:01:03.039> from<00:01:03.399> a

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
if maybe it'll survive the drop from a

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.500 
if maybe it'll survive the drop from a
little<00:01:03.819> higher<00:01:04.149> say<00:01:05.280> girl<00:01:06.280> tall<00:01:07.119> building

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.080 

maybe<00:01:11.510> not<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.810> building<00:01:12.430> alright<00:01:13.430> how

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
maybe not that building alright how

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.300 
maybe not that building alright how
about<00:01:14.120> our<00:01:14.330> building<00:01:14.860> cool<00:01:15.860> let's<00:01:16.130> see<00:01:16.220> how<00:01:16.280> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
about our building cool let's see how it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.969
