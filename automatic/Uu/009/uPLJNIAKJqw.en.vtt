00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.119
 the text was tapped in this time there look publishing pcm has its own 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.990

 it's a dark mysterious trend disaster that traditionally doesn't really like it 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.870
 a little bit about nevertheless the camp does not have the clear one 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.000
 chairs since then played high squatters and the strong shoulders dark 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 lipstick dibi if you do not pay attention to gala in the spring, it is also a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 example of a little kardashian bear also showed by his hands 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.589
 that you really don't just have to wear the dresses 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.689
 this is my outfit with this trend, it wasn't for the bad ones either 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.689
 image quality it was a strong dark guild 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.829
 ned 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.899

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.899
 the duel 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.229
 you were already known to call the shooting sport remarkable and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.839
 and the elderly it is not directly a new trend in my opinion where I still find 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:16.219
 always that for this summer I really like to bump into what you naturally decide 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.239
 the holes counted numbers on clothing stripes on clothing 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.639

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.869
 for that who if I can of course also close some of the spring break 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.899
 I am also really crazy about my own outfit, this trend is 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.899

 tnt just says it all but everything in the mix is â€‹â€‹actually just everything 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.439
 to wear in and then you give this trend a sign in bright color 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.400

 And in earlier times, lipstick was a little regretting to illness 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.749
