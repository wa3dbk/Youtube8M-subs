up so yes here is my sternum 5017 that I
will<00:04:19.199> be<00:04:19.350> building<00:04:20.959> overseen<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:24.360> yeah<00:04:24.870> there

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
will be building overseen so yeah there

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.920 
will be building overseen so yeah there
we<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.970> new<00:04:26.970> airplane<00:04:27.449> that<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.780> are
