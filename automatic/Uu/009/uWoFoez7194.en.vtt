good stories really engage you so we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.810 
good stories really engage you so we
have<00:01:44.300> within<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.050> limited<00:01:45.350> sandbox<00:01:46.009> scenarios

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
have within a limited sandbox scenarios

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.490 
have within a limited sandbox scenarios
what<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.150> call<00:01:47.300> wide<00:01:47.690> linear<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.320> have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
what we call wide linear you have

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.109 
what we call wide linear you have
choices<00:01:48.740> but<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:49.640> there's<00:01:49.790> other<00:01:49.940> times

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
where you start off with let's say a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.480 
where you start off with let's say a
high<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> scene<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.740> then<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.190> end<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
high in the scene and then you end on a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.730 
high in the scene and then you end on a
low<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:28.910> called<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.360> turn<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:30.410> also<00:02:30.530> have

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
low it's called it the turn we also have

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.250 
low it's called it the turn we also have
something<00:02:30.920> called<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.220> gap<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> gap<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
something called a gap so a gap is the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.620 
something called a gap so a gap is the
gap<00:02:33.860> between<00:02:33.980> expectation<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.790> result<00:02:35.120> so

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
gap between expectation and result so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.270 
gap between expectation and result so
you<00:02:35.690> expect<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.230> go<00:02:36.319> into<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> seen<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> certain
