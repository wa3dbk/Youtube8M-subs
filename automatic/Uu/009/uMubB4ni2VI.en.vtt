into<00:00:13.280> two<00:00:13.490> sections<00:00:13.960> take<00:00:14.960> a<00:00:14.990> small<00:00:15.320> section

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
into two sections take a small section

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.620 
into two sections take a small section
of<00:00:15.889> hair<00:00:15.950> from<00:00:16.130> the<00:00:16.309> top<00:00:16.610> of<00:00:16.790> your<00:00:16.910> head<00:00:17.150> divide

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
of hair from the top of your head divide

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.630 
of hair from the top of your head divide
it<00:00:17.750> into<00:00:17.900> three<00:00:18.230> parts<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:18.740> create<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:19.400> Dutch

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
it into three parts and create a Dutch

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.570 
it into three parts and create a Dutch
braid<00:00:20.020> this<00:00:21.020> braid<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.410> very<00:00:21.859> similar<00:00:22.340> to<00:00:22.460> the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
braid this braid is very similar to the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.820 
braid this braid is very similar to the
French<00:00:22.789> braid<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.600> only<00:00:23.869> difference<00:00:24.260> is<00:00:24.470> it

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
French braid the only difference is it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.859 
French braid the only difference is it
is<00:00:25.010> formed<00:00:25.430> by<00:00:25.520> placing<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.000> strands<00:00:26.390> under

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
is formed by placing the strands under

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.010 
is formed by placing the strands under
rather<00:00:27.170> than<00:00:27.439> over<00:00:27.770> each<00:00:27.920> other

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.610

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.389 
I've got the goodest a phone they call
the<00:00:37.800> end

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.779 

that's<00:00:43.320> pretend<00:00:44.320> it'll<00:00:44.620> feel<00:00:44.800> like<00:00:45.039> giving<00:00:45.550> it

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
that's pretend it'll feel like giving it

that's pretend it'll feel like giving it
if<00:00:46.000> nothing<00:00:46.570> else<00:00:46.809> I'll<00:00:47.260> imagine<00:00:47.829> bye<00:00:48.360> until

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
if nothing else I'll imagine bye until

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.810 
if nothing else I'll imagine bye until
then<00:00:50.350> let's<00:00:51.219> pretend<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.339> reach<00:00:54.579> the
