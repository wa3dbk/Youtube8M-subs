00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.700
 take individualities then because 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.460
 we did not see pastore we did not have 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 seen from feathers to February beginning 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 February I think we've seen rabiot 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.619
 individualities because they are 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 all put tonight in conditions 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.830
 which are not optimal 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.630
 because they are put in a 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.070
 compo with people who do not have 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.840
 used to play playing together 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.820
 it's easy to put a guy new 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 in the colomé cartonne but then there is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.390
 six to seven energy players well if 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.700
 What is the problem 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.400
 tonight the podium tonight is really 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.360
 seriously, this is not to hurt yourself 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.030
 so get in shape cavani see a 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.330
 little bit everything all the workforce and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 that's what's the purpose of this evening 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.920
 was a moment you realize that at the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.750
 middle you miss the three years to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 a title as much and fashion and matuidi 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.280
 they are replaced by three very good 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.570
 the belgian is really bis rue marquinhos 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.039
 once again demonstrates that it is a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.339
 player in the making but everything for the 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.550
 moment 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.930
 he can not dislodge alex no jalibert he 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.100
 mark a lot for a defender it's 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.210
 the third goal in the Champions league 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.590
 there are going to be a lot of defenders who 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.000
 do that it's true that now with 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.710
 functions no I do not look at his 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.289
 stats guardian but just to say 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.300
 you see it's in the surface it's 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.700
 often present after a little bit i was going to b 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.200
 will allow léa van der wiel to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.369
 to rest a little more than van der wiel 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.770
 has in recent weeks these 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.689
 last few months that playing south is 10 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.729
 attention for the France team but 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.070
 worthy can play the post for me with 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.070
 maxwell for me maxwell him again 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.450
 broad political differences either one 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.670
 like current is far superior 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.939
 paulo you did not expect anything else 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.409
 more of the group 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.030
 not necessarily your way against 4 0 to 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.869
 the go you can not hope much 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.329
 I I 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.530
 given the current crisis of the Bayer Leekkusen 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.439
 what was interesting was 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.000
 to try to make one to match 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.079
 near correct I still find 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.729
 that there is a lot more waste from 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.689
 side of leverkusen than paris who 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.899
 also had a lot of absent from the side 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.899
 the hours
