 &gt;&gt; Jin Lee: Hello, my name is Jennifer and I work for the Google Search Quality Team. Frequently Asked Questions 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.330
 What we hear from new site owners, "How do I show my site in Google search results?" 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.099
 Well, start with the good news, that Google may have already found the new content. 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.590
 You can easily determine whether Google is showing your site in search results by making an action 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.590
 So-called site search. To do this, from the Google search bar, type site and then the colon 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:33.360
 And then the domain name without any spaces. If something appears, congratulations, your site is within 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.440
 Google search results. If there are fewer pages already displayed on your site, 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.770
 Make sure we can search for and crawl content and provide value to users. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.940
 It's also possible that we have not discovered those pages yet. In this case, your best bet is yours 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.410
 Is to be patient, as you are likely to notice the change soon, if you want to speed up from 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.610
 This process, add content to Google via the gadget on Google.com/submityourcontent. 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.610
 On the other hand, if you never see anything in your site search, there may be a group 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.210
 Factors behind this, and one of the most common reasons why your site may be blocked for crawlers 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.830
 Through a so-called robots.txt file. You can learn more about this at 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.350
 Help Center resources. If you recently purchased your domain, it probably does not work well 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.420
 Because it officially guarantees unwanted content or its problems. If you think that may be the reason 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 You'll need to sign in to Webmaster Tools and add and verify your new site 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.310
 Then submit a request for reconsideration with this information. If your site appears in search results however 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.710
 Pages do not work the way you want, remember that Google detects new pages 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 On your site as users do by following links from page to page. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.670
 This means that the easier users browse the site, the easier it is for Google to discover its content. 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.729
 Adding a bar or menu to navigate to your site is a common way 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.740
 And safe to improve site navigation. You can always find more information by 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.139
