into<00:01:24.210> about<00:01:24.600> why<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.990> such<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> bad<00:01:25.530> thing

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
into about why that's such a bad thing

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
into about why that's such a bad thing
what<00:01:26.280> triple<00:01:26.520> capping<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
what triple capping is is when you go

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
what triple capping is is when you go
into<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> domination<00:01:28.320> game<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.070> capture

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
into a domination game and you capture

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
into a domination game and you capture
all<00:01:29.579> three<00:01:29.820> flags<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> same<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.020> B<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
all three flags at the same time a B and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
all three flags at the same time a B and
C<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.890> why<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.250> such<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> bad<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.030> do

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
C now why that's such a bad thing to do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
C now why that's such a bad thing to do
is<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> capture<00:01:34.380> those<00:01:34.500> three<00:01:34.770> flags<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
is when you capture those three flags it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
is when you capture those three flags it
really<00:01:35.670> leaves<00:01:35.820> no<00:01:36.060> spawn<00:01:36.450> point<00:01:36.750> available

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
really leaves no spawn point available

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
really leaves no spawn point available
for<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> enemy<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> be

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
for the enemy so they're going to be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
for the enemy so they're going to be
spawning<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> map<00:01:39.720> anywhere<00:01:40.200> they

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
spawning all over the map anywhere they

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
spawning all over the map anywhere they
can<00:01:40.439> spawn<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:41.009> there's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> teammate

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
can spawn where there's not a teammate

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.609 
can spawn where there's not a teammate
currently<00:01:42.390> ad<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> puff

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
stomper you know how frustrating it is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
stomper you know how frustrating it is

have that one guy that's not on your
party<00:01:48.720> push<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> spawns<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
party push into the spawns and take that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
party push into the spawns and take that
third<00:01:50.369> flag<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> you'll<00:01:51.240> end<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.479> dying<00:01:51.750> from

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
third flag and you'll end up dying from

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
third flag and you'll end up dying from
the<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.619> USC<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.280> majority<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the back and as USC a majority of the

game<00:01:54.180> plays<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.540> YouTube<00:01:54.930> nowadays<00:01:55.409> are

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
game plays on YouTube nowadays are

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
game plays on YouTube nowadays are
running<00:01:55.950> spawns<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.549> strike<00:01:57.119> zone<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
running spawns on strike zone and the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
running spawns on strike zone and the
reason<00:01:58.170> why<00:01:58.259> they're<00:01:58.469> able<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
reason why they're able to do that is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
reason why they're able to do that is
because<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.969> capture<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.750> B<00:02:00.899> flag<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
because they capture a and B flag and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
because they capture a and B flag and
they<00:02:01.500> leave<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:02.159> flag<00:02:02.430> open<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.060> capture

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
they leave see flag open or they capture

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.149 
they leave see flag open or they capture
C<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> B<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.079> leave<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.380> flag<00:02:04.619> open<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
C and B and leave a flag open and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.260 
C and B and leave a flag open and
they're<00:02:05.310> able<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:06.060> they

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
they're able to do this because they

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.340 
they're able to do this because they
have<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.509> map<00:02:06.719> control<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.259> they

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
have good map control and they

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
have good map control and they
understand<00:02:07.799> how<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> map<00:02:08.220> works<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> they

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
understand how the map works and they

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.339 
understand how the map works and they
have<00:02:09.060> good<00:02:09.239> understanding<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> spawn

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
have good understanding of the spawn

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.990 
have good understanding of the spawn
points<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.400> leave<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.640> one

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
points so if you just leave that one

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
points so if you just leave that one
flag<00:02:12.300> open<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> make<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> spawn

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
flag open it's going to make the spawn

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.120 
flag open it's going to make the spawn
system<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.920> lot

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
system a lot

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.650 
system a lot
more<00:02:14.280> easier<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.330> you're<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.600> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
more easier for you and you're going to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.090 
more easier for you and you're going to
understand<00:02:16.140> where<00:02:16.290> their<00:02:16.410> spawning<00:02:16.710> because

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
understand where their spawning because

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.920 
understand where their spawning because
if<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> leave<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:17.880> flag<00:02:18.150> open<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.780> it's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
if you leave that one flag open and it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.150 
if you leave that one flag open and it's
the<00:02:19.050> enemies<00:02:19.380> that's<00:02:19.740> where<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> know

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the enemies that's where you know

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.260 
the enemies that's where you know
they're<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.640> spawning<00:02:20.910> out<00:02:21.120> you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
they're going to be spawning out you're

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.250 
they're going to be spawning out you're
going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> give<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> basic<00:02:22.140> understanding

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
going to give it a basic understanding

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
going to give it a basic understanding
of<00:02:22.890> what's<00:02:23.160> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> happen<00:02:23.670> when<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> leave

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that one flag open the next thing that I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500 
that one flag open the next thing that I
note<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.850> sure<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.150> run<00:02:27.390> in

note it down is to make sure you run in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.910 
note it down is to make sure you run in
parties<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.290> before<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.710> actually

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
parties because before I actually

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.740 
parties because before I actually
started<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.610> hard<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> call<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.240> duty<00:02:30.360> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
started going hard in call of duty I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.870 
started going hard in call of duty I
realized<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.010> running<00:02:32.190> solo<00:02:32.670> I'd

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
realized that if I was running solo I'd

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.490 
realized that if I was running solo I'd
end<00:02:33.090> up<00:02:33.120> getting<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> lot<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:33.930> times<00:02:34.350> than

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
end up getting be a lot more times than

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.200 
end up getting be a lot more times than
I<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.860> running<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.220> parties<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I would be running in parties and as a
