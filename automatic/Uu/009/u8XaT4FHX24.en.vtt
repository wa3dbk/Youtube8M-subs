00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
disgusting to relic but other ones I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.760 
disgusting to relic but other ones I
kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
kind of like it and this one I think the
rollicking<00:00:35.040> makes<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> play<00:00:36.120> better<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
rollicking makes it play better and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.130 
rollicking makes it play better and
probably<00:00:36.989> affects<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> sound<00:00:37.860> they've<00:00:39.140> worn

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
all the finish off the back so it's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.950 
all the finish off the back so it's
silky<00:00:42.629> smooth<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> super<00:00:44.969> thin<00:00:45.450> I

maybe<00:05:07.850> I'll<00:05:08.000> do<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:08.180> as<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.540> different<00:05:09.020> a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
maybe I'll do that as a different a

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.020 
maybe I'll do that as a different a
different<00:05:10.760> video<00:05:11.330> clip<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:13.700> sounds

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
different video clip so it sounds
