that<00:02:28.300> they<00:02:28.480> would<00:02:28.660> be<00:02:28.720> relevant<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.610> next

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
that they would be relevant in the next

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.180 
that they would be relevant in the next
format<00:02:31.420> once<00:02:32.260> these<00:02:32.410> guys<00:02:32.620> come<00:02:32.920> out<00:02:32.950> well

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
