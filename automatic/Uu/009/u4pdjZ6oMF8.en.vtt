00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
expose the adhesive and then consider

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.920 
expose the adhesive and then consider
the<00:03:40.170> circuit<00:03:40.560> board<00:03:40.769> side<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:42.450> gonna<00:03:42.660> place

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the circuit board side just gonna place

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.870 
the circuit board side just gonna place
that<00:03:43.400> right<00:03:44.400> down<00:03:44.549> there

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.660 

make<00:03:47.880> sure<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> connectors<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:50.239> are<00:03:51.239> free

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
make sure the connectors are are free

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.590 
make sure the connectors are are free
just<00:03:53.670> push<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.120> down

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
just push it down

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.640 
just push it down
yeah<00:03:58.240> all<00:03:59.240> right<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.690> XO<00:04:00.080> we're<00:04:00.200> just<00:04:00.320> needs<00:04:00.470> to

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
yeah all right so XO we're just needs to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.260 
yeah all right so XO we're just needs to
take<00:04:00.920> out<00:04:01.130> these<00:04:01.250> two<00:04:01.310> screws<00:04:01.580> here<00:04:02.030> at<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
take out these two screws here at the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:21.940 
take out these two screws here at the
end<00:04:07.540> hopefully<00:04:08.830> these<00:04:09.830> don't<00:04:10.100> get<00:04:10.190> lost<00:04:20.950> then

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
end hopefully these don't get lost then

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:30.510 
end hopefully these don't get lost then
we're<00:04:22.130> going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.490> flip<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.420> end<00:04:23.690> out<00:04:29.500> alright

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
we're going to flip this end out alright

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.070 
we're going to flip this end out alright
alright<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:31.700> next<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.660> something

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
alright so next I just something

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.540 
alright so next I just something
connected<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.890> connector<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:36.920> will<00:04:37.100> slip

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
connected the connector and we will slip

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:45.340 
connected the connector and we will slip
it<00:04:37.730> into<00:04:37.880> here<00:04:38.600> like<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.780> put<00:04:44.780> these<00:04:44.990> two

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
it into here like that and put these two

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:55.110 
it into here like that and put these two
screws<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:46.010> which<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.700> provide<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.350> in<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.500> bag

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.159 

just<00:04:56.120> gonna<00:04:56.270> get<00:04:56.419> them<00:04:56.510> out<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.780> set<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.140> right

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
just gonna get them out and set it right

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.909 
just gonna get them out and set it right
here<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:59.510> then<00:04:59.570> we<00:04:59.990> will<00:05:00.110> begin<00:05:00.260> putting<00:05:00.680> them

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
here and then we will begin putting them

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.610 
here and then we will begin putting them
in<00:05:02.230> you<00:05:03.230> can<00:05:03.380> see<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.710> two<00:05:03.919> holes<00:05:03.950> here<00:05:05.620> let's

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
in you can see the two holes here let's

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.760 
in you can see the two holes here let's
get<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.010> light<00:05:08.380> just<00:05:09.380> started<00:05:09.650> taking

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
get it in the light just started taking

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.670 
get it in the light just started taking
them<00:05:10.040> in<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:13.630> there's<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.720> very<00:05:14.990> small<00:05:15.320> screw

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
them in and there's a very small screw

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.650 
them in and there's a very small screw
is<00:05:15.830> very<00:05:16.040> fragile<00:05:16.520> so<00:05:16.910> just<00:05:17.090> be<00:05:17.240> careful<00:05:17.419> not

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
is very fragile so just be careful not

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.890 
is very fragile so just be careful not
to<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:18.140> strip<00:05:18.620> them<00:05:18.770> out<00:05:19.690> then<00:05:20.690> we're<00:05:20.810> gonna

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
to I strip them out then we're gonna

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.100 
to I strip them out then we're gonna
simply<00:05:21.350> take<00:05:21.560> this<00:05:21.710> back<00:05:21.979> cover<00:05:22.960> slip<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
simply take this back cover slip it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.770 
simply take this back cover slip it
under<00:05:24.350> here<00:05:25.180> don't<00:05:26.180> believe<00:05:26.419> it<00:05:26.600> really

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
under here don't believe it really

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.810 
under here don't believe it really
matters<00:05:27.110> which<00:05:27.380> way<00:05:27.590> it<00:05:27.740> goes<00:05:30.490> gonna<00:05:31.490> pop<00:05:31.790> that

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
matters which way it goes gonna pop that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.730 
matters which way it goes gonna pop that
into<00:05:32.180> there

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.379 

and<00:05:37.740> then<00:05:37.830> what<00:05:37.979> insert<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.400> screws<00:05:38.729> or<00:05:39.060> on

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
and then what insert the screws or on

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.350 
and then what insert the screws or on
either<00:05:39.600> side<00:05:40.430> all<00:05:41.430> right<00:05:41.580> now<00:05:41.970> it's<00:05:42.180> all

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
either side all right now it's all

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.960 
either side all right now it's all
closed<00:05:42.630> up<00:05:45.380> now<00:05:46.380> we'll<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:46.650> connect<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.460> USB

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
closed up now we'll just connect the USB

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.159 
closed up now we'll just connect the USB
port<00:05:48.630> or<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.320> USB<00:05:49.560> cord<00:05:50.449> USB<00:05:51.449> cable<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:51.930> guess

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
port or the USB cord USB cable I guess

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:01.770 
port or the USB cord USB cable I guess
is<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:53.030> proper<00:05:54.030> Jam

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.360 

let's<00:06:02.440> see<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.710> has<00:06:02.890> two<00:06:03.160> ends<00:06:03.400> on<00:06:03.640> it<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:05.370> then

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
let's see it has two ends on it and then

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.970 
let's see it has two ends on it and then
this<00:06:06.670> end<00:06:07.860> just<00:06:08.860> plugs<00:06:09.250> right<00:06:09.370> into<00:06:09.640> here
