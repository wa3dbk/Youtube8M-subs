00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
get one vote or else that'd be kind of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
get one vote or else that'd be kind of
weird<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.220> stranger<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.880> happened

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
but I would assume we're only getting

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
but I would assume we're only getting
one<00:01:40.350> vote<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.280> course<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.670> finalists<00:01:42.240> are

a<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.020> not<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> criminal<00:02:37.010> case<00:02:37.220> that's

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
a it's not like a criminal case that's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.520 
a it's not like a criminal case that's
going<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.820> here<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.660> NFL<00:02:38.930> that's<00:02:39.290> in

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
going on here it's the NFL that's in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.010 
going on here it's the NFL that's in
charge<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.360> they're<00:02:41.600> obviously

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
charge of all this so they're obviously

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.820 
charge of all this so they're obviously
going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.470> appeal<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:44.410> they<00:02:45.410> might<00:02:45.650> get

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
going to appeal it and they might get

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.190 
going to appeal it and they might get
something<00:02:46.100> reduced<00:02:46.660> because<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.140> said

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
something reduced because like I said

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.050 
something reduced because like I said
before<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.650> think<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:49.010> pretty<00:02:49.100> harsh<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.670> lot

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
before I think it's pretty harsh a lot

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.040 
before I think it's pretty harsh a lot
of<00:02:50.090> people<00:02:50.239> were<00:02:50.450> saying<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.900> wasn't

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
of people were saying that it wasn't

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.300 
of people were saying that it wasn't
enough<00:02:51.380> some<00:02:51.560> people<00:02:51.590> were<00:02:51.830> saying<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.190> it's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
enough some people were saying that it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.660 
enough some people were saying that it's
too<00:02:52.459> much<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:54.739> they<00:02:54.980> could<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.550> reduced

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
too much but they could get it reduced

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.790 
too much but they could get it reduced
because<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.239> think<00:02:56.420> there's<00:02:56.570> any

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
because I don't think there's any

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.490 
because I don't think there's any
definitive<00:02:57.800> evidence<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> yet<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:02.500> but

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
definitive evidence of it yet and but

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.900 
definitive evidence of it yet and but
it's<00:03:03.620> looking<00:03:03.769> it's<00:03:04.100> looking<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
it's looking it's looking like and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.030 
it's looking it's looking like and
because<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.050> criminal<00:03:06.260> court<00:03:06.590> they

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
because this is in a criminal court they

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.949 
because this is in a criminal court they
don't<00:03:07.220> have<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.550> prove<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.900> a

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
don't have to prove it like it's a
