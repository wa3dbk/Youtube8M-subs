00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
going to strum

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.130 
going to strum
like<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:41.240> let's<00:01:41.390> get<00:01:41.480> our<00:01:41.600> fingers<00:01:41.750> on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.080 
like that so let's get our fingers on
the<00:01:42.770> chords<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.220> we're<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.520> need<00:01:43.700> for

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the chords that we're going to need for

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.790 
the chords that we're going to need for
the<00:01:44.180> intro<00:01:44.540> first<00:01:44.810> we're<00:01:45.380> going<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.560> start

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
the intro first we're going to start

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.370 
the intro first we're going to start
with<00:01:45.980> this<00:01:46.100> standard<00:01:46.490> D<00:01:46.610> chord<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.990> then

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
with this standard D chord and then

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.110 
with this standard D chord and then
we're<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.620> to<00:01:48.680> go<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.100> kind<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.940> D

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
we're going to go to this kind of D

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.650 
we're going to go to this kind of D
variation<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:50.990> major<00:01:51.290> 7<00:01:51.710> with<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> 2<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.250> there

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
variation to a major 7 with a 2 in there

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.600 
variation to a major 7 with a 2 in there
so<00:01:53.660> we've<00:01:53.810> got<00:01:53.990> open<00:01:54.260> D<00:01:54.530> string<00:01:54.560> two<00:01:55.400> frets

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
so we've got open D string two frets

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.150 
so we've got open D string two frets
above<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.000> capo<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.510> G<00:01:57.350> two<00:01:57.620> frets<00:01:57.830> above<00:01:58.040> the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
that will help a lot and we're going to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.610 
that will help a lot and we're going to
start<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.970> these<00:02:41.569> intro<00:02:42.050> riffs<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.410> we're

start with these intro riffs that we're

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.180 
start with these intro riffs that we're
going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.800> learn<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.760> sounds<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.030> this

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.200 

second<00:02:52.190> time

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.640 

all<00:02:59.020> right<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.230> we're<00:02:59.350> kind<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.500> just

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
all right so we're kind of just

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.100 
all right so we're kind of just
outlining<00:03:00.070> these<00:03:00.310> chords<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.760> arpeggios<00:03:00.850> and

outlining these chords and arpeggios and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.380 
outlining these chords and arpeggios and
F<00:03:02.260> right<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.650> we've<00:03:02.770> got<00:03:02.800> 14th<00:03:03.760> fret<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.030> G<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
F right so we've got 14th fret of G and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.690 
F right so we've got 14th fret of G and
then<00:03:04.540> we're<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.780> Barre<00:03:04.960> 13th<00:03:05.680> fret<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.130> B

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
then we're going to Barre 13th fret of B
