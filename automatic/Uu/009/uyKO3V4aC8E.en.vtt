finishing the knot it's best to have the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.060 
finishing the knot it's best to have the
last<00:00:35.730> point<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.540> fairly<00:00:37.200> close<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
last point be fairly close to where you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
last point be fairly close to where you
started<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.480> too<00:00:39.690> close<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.590> about

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
started but not too close this is about

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
started but not too close this is about

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
with the not just complete this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.900 
with the not just complete this
component<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.180> closed<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.710> open<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.820> we're

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
component as closed or as open so we're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
component as closed or as open so we're
going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> close<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:49.129> then<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.219> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
going to close up this one then we can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.279 
going to close up this one then we can
go<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> main<00:00:50.820> member<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> our<00:00:51.930> newly<00:00:52.260> created

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
go to main member that our newly created

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:02.150 
go to main member that our newly created
not<00:00:53.149> now<00:00:56.300> try<00:00:57.300> relaxing<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.710> go<00:01:01.160> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
not now try relaxing it there we go if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
not now try relaxing it there we go if
instead<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.670> wanted<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> sketch<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> knot

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
instead you wanted to sketch a knot

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.609 
instead you wanted to sketch a knot
which<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:09.650> something<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:12.470> going<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
which is something or other going to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.999 
which is something or other going to
sketch<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.689> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.560> over

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sketch and if you want to start over

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
sketch and if you want to start over
delete<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:22.520> click<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> drag<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
delete all and click and drag to go to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
delete all and click and drag to go to
create<00:01:25.650> an<00:01:25.740> alternating<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:27.030> doesn't

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
create an alternating not this doesn't

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.219 
create an alternating not this doesn't
always<00:01:27.540> work<00:01:27.780> perfectly<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.530> sometimes<00:01:30.229> when

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
always work perfectly but sometimes when

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.920 
always work perfectly but sometimes when
I<00:01:31.320> close<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.640> close<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> main<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> try

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I close that and close it main and I try

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.330 
I close that and close it main and I try
relaxing<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.979> we'll<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.100> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
relaxing this know I can we'll see like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
relaxing this know I can we'll see like
we<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.740> trip<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:41.040> knot
