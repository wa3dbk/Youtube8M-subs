00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.900
 the driver the ancients 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.630
 then in the commitment initially 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.030
 the promoter the new law c 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.200
 0 nana in Sao Paulo 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.020
 taking advantage of this evaluation even dead 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.520
 federal prosecutors 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490
 talking to everyone manufactured 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.240
 and with 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 see I gave my eyebrows 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 ef 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 the wave of better quality and technology he actually recorded centimeters 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.480
 are the actions of the seven doors 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.570
 the stand of the city of samarra 21 dead should grow and create the bases of peace 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.420
 for sure 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.580
 In Brazil today, evaluate. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.880
 to provide the engines one option is to buy a motorcycle 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.980
 Since she was little 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.290
 as it was made mine did not appear summary of the game 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.229
 just as it was with timely counsel that they especially of the dead 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 exclusive 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 the same does not happen on Friday but warns that a good formation 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.840
 I sincerely apologize for the program done so when I walk corvette now 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.980
 why is looking 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.210
 It's a joke, man. 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 are also 505 horsepower 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 on an American icon 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.659
 We're talking corvette. 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.449
 the people 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.589
 I was going to turn a thought of the mobilis 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.709
 because if such is it 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.369
 How can you say 'yes' 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.679
 you have idea of ​​the injury author that if a horse space motor he is 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.759
 used even in the competition stores here 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.709
 this is his key 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.329
 this one finds the car 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.429
 and you'll soon have a corvette with me here in cuiabá 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.579
 to show you that here you also have asylum cases of 550 times one 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 machine with a resulting death 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.699
 the barcelona click here 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.379
 in contact with ge net 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.329
 nothing more, nothing less 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.259
 five year old daughter 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.719
 keep calling me, it's a dream of the real Americans 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.889
 fish here 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.199
 he is an American icon 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.119
 He's a guy as soon as he leaves us. 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.529
 really because he felt like a pilot 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.769
 You get a car from these. 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.529
 Do you really want 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.409
 Do you realize that a car 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.169
 in fact it is done 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.579
 to make you feel like a racing driver 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.279
 on the spot rebel 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:32.059
 and you sit there will walk with your family because it is a car of two 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.679
 seats is a car 800 bikes bring 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:36.799
 very strong car 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.889
 we have answers you can understand 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.979
 because every car mainly sports them they change reason 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.339
 they change the drivability 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.629
 what the vision you have here has changed many things 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.419
 It's important that you know 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.649
 cocoa highlight in that it was medical of 30 people 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:04:00.219
 like cars tourism is american cars is an american car 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:06.349
 that affects the counting on ferraris with the paulista an American chaos with great 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.479
 balances between the same sports 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.449
 do not let 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.999
 not a bit to be desired 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.050
 including 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.749
 he is a general gm car of the dead 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.749
 he is a car a ford gt is manufactured 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.349
 the general theme dead in the bio gourmet world we have and if you are in a 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.949
 shape and 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.390
 he is crazy 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.909
 the fish 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.999
 oo our friend at the inn speaks up I've seen so many bands buffets or emerson 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.090
 fittipaldi 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.770
 He drove a car from this one. 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.840
 when or by itself central car 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.050
 nice view 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.680
 dd for his mother is also the pet 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.069
 the idea is to follow along 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.520
 the situation he is calculating the pat on the formula-indy she arrived 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.800
 to be fired but doubts and not here 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.430
 they so with the car-godmother they do not comment everything in a stream ran very 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.150
 because the cars have no formula 1 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.770
 when they unduly need to maintain a certain speed because 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.559
 I believe in this speed because they need 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.979
 ground cooling on the spot a veto they will lose the fear of the press in the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.040
 average car enough inside the car 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.860
 for that 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.190
 they use balsamic aceto and there happens the announcement of itep where it goes 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.669
 can do 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.150
 In a situation like this, it was in this job that he needed to be with a 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.939
 car bomb I was very 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.249
 everything is very strange is that we gave everything in the city limits can not 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:28.159
 for sure 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.899
 to make fun, we can not go over here, at the speed allowed 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.860
 I already made a violent mistake 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.129
 because 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.639
 and make my mistake 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.740
 I had not placed without security 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.559
 I am from what? 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.559
 end up happening this 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.460
 put them safely 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.360
 now i put it 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.400
 know how it is that I was moved image mounted this new engine 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.569
 to have been acquitted is that it exists in horses you get fierce in the middle 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.999
 but what happens to you? 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.599
 know the power of your car 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.439
 There you fascinate half-day study of cigarettes 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.759
 I've seen a magazine in English to catch a flight to avoid a war 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.759
 civilian but rebounding but sometimes 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.629
 there is a big difference between ct 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.659
 505 horses made by having slight 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.479
 a car like these 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.080
 around the world 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.520
 We're going to Newcastle 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.860
 which is really cool anywhere in the world if it's with the truth 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.550
 so many the lack is a rope of areas of the center of limeira 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.029
 if we say anything about these people 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.250
 Let's go crazy 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.909
 res 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.029
 bush 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.809
 good 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.089
 all this 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.089
 that 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.860
 when we are talking about something designed 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.110
 depends on the braking ability 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:03.180
 biden suspension for this type of motorization error has 561 points I will 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.909
 Talk to you guys, I'm going to take a quick stint. 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.999
 How does it work better? 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.869
 also depends on pmdb 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:21.869
 a hope good will 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.330
 nothing explains enem can do this much 

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.930
 and until 1h the sin of the vacancies each 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.619
 but for our struggle to get here do not further from kings 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:34.839
 who can compare 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.860
 but the idea was this but for you 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.419
 building 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.149
 It's a wonderful car. 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:42.930
 Ricardo says the process 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.620
 in hair
