be<00:01:26.710> close<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.820> hundred<00:01:27.909> percent<00:01:28.180> if<00:01:28.570> not<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
be close to a hundred percent if not and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
be close to a hundred percent if not and
hopefully<00:01:30.130> they'll<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.580> able<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.880> clear<00:01:31.150> me<00:01:31.270> by

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
a receiver that goes over the middle and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
judge that I think it's one the timely

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.600 
judge that I think it's one the timely
of<00:01:52.210> when<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.510> get<00:01:52.660> your<00:01:52.690> surgery<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
of when you get your surgery and the

of when you get your surgery and the
recovery<00:01:55.240> process<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:56.140> how<00:01:56.260> your<00:01:56.530> body

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
recovery process and how your body

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.190 
recovery process and how your body
adapts<00:01:57.790> everyone's<00:01:58.120> body<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.510> different<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.140> I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
adapts everyone's body is different so I

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.620 
adapts everyone's body is different so I
can't<00:01:59.500> really<00:02:00.130> judge<00:02:00.610> for<00:02:00.940> Cody<00:02:01.210> we've

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
can't really judge for Cody we've

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.970 
can't really judge for Cody we've
already<00:02:01.840> discussed<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.560> differences

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980
