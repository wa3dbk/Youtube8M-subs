he'll<00:00:00.149> break<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:01.110> actually<00:00:01.589> found<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.310> own

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319 
he'll break I actually found my own

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.170 
he'll break I actually found my own
exploit<00:00:04.319> it<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.740> all<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.670> boot<00:00:05.940> ROM

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
exploit it is all of this is boot ROM

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.950 
exploit it is all of this is boot ROM
based<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> untethered<00:00:08.700> jailbreak

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
based so this is a untethered jailbreak

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.870 
based so this is a untethered jailbreak
there<00:00:09.960> will<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.380> instructions<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
there will be instructions and a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the link is in the video I'm not going

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.210 
the link is in the video I'm not going
to<00:00:16.080> put<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> description<00:00:16.529> because<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to put in the description because I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.550 
to put in the description because I
don't<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.490> people<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.990> really<00:00:18.990> spread<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
don't want people to really spread this

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.490 
don't want people to really spread this
out<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.400> yet<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> jailbreak<00:00:22.320> is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
out just yet but the jailbreak is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
out just yet but the jailbreak is
actually<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.039> linux<00:00:23.400> you'll<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.820> something

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
actually for linux you'll need something

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.550 
actually for linux you'll need something
like<00:00:24.510> Ubuntu<00:00:25.140> Ubuntu<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.880> install

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
like Ubuntu Ubuntu to actually install

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.870 
like Ubuntu Ubuntu to actually install
but<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> end<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.369> video<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.849> show

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.610 
you how to do this now this is a very
basic<00:00:32.189> jailbreak<00:00:32.930> mobile<00:00:33.930> substrates<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
basic jailbreak mobile substrates is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.610 
basic jailbreak mobile substrates is
actually<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.160> working<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.260> sbsettings<00:00:37.260> does

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
actually not working so sbsettings does

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.030 
actually not working so sbsettings does
not<00:00:37.800> work<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:39.090> none<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.629> stuff<00:00:40.040> so
