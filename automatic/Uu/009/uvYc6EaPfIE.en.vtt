00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
trying to wreck you form a talk fighter
this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.260> first<00:00:22.529> attempt<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
this is my first attempt at it and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
this is my first attempt at it and
they're<00:00:24.270> using<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.720> factored<00:00:25.050> form<00:00:25.260> so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
they're using this factored form so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
they're using this factored form so
hopefully<00:00:26.520> it<00:00:26.640> works<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:28.350> moment
