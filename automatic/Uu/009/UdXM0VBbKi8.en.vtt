00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
camera in the direction that the rocket

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
camera in the direction that the rocket
should<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:44.040> we'll<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> peek

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
should be and maybe we'll see a peek

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.150 
should be and maybe we'll see a peek
through<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.180> clouds<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> never<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.260> oh

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.770 

this<00:00:50.160> scientist<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.940> came<00:00:51.180> across<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> live

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this scientist just came across the live

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650 
this scientist just came across the live
stream<00:00:52.170> he's<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:52.949> red<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.360> three

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
stream he's like we are red for three

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.920 
stream he's like we are red for three
different<00:00:54.840> weather<00:00:55.260> constraints<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:57.140> yeah

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
different weather constraints so yeah

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
different weather constraints so yeah
that's<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.170> funny<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.579> than<00:01:02.670> likely

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that's really funny so more than likely

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
that's really funny so more than likely
won't<00:01:03.270> launch<00:01:03.420> today<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> next

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
won't launch today and I think the next

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
won't launch today and I think the next
launch<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> tomorrow<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.850> we'll<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.210> we'll

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
launch is tomorrow so we'll see we'll

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.880 
launch is tomorrow so we'll see we'll
