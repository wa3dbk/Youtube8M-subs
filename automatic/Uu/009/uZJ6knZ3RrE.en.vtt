00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.330
Hey what's going on cajon players, welcome
back to a new here on my channel. I've got

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.360
a new groove for you guys to learn! The first
thought behind this groove was to do something

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.230
a little bit heavier with a bit more of a
punk feel. But the second thought was that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.040
there are a few very valuable exercises in
here for your technique and your timing. So

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.760
we're going to look at both aspects. So firstly,
let's bring it down to a slow tempo so I can

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.760
show you guys what's going on. And then we'll
talk about how to make it really sound good after that.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:35.977
Okay, so now we've started working on our groove for today.

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.785
Now that feels like quite a good work out or exercise to me

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:41.935
For a few different reasons.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Firstly, we're playing this slow enough right now that there's enough space between each beat and the click of the metronome

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.425
That we can really hear ourselves when we miss the beat.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:54.860
So this is great practice for our timing.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.940
The second great thing happening here is for our technique.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.560
Now there's a lot of bass with both right and left hand.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.360
The same goes for the snare.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.820
Now, you know there are a lot grooves out there where you can play without using too much of the left hand on the bass

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.800
Or something similar, that's a problem that I personally have.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:16.975
Now, what this does is.

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:19.960
It really gives me a chance to practice that left hand

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.080
Because right now, at this tempo.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.500
It's so obvious and it really sticks out when this left hand doesn't make the big bouncy bass tone that the right hand does

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:38.573
So when you get that BOOM boom, BOOM, boom. You can really hear it

00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:41.440
And it gives a chance to identify that, so that we can work on it.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.200
And the other thing that this really helps with is practicing subdivisions

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.100
So we've got most of that groove just in 8th notes.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.460
Just one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four e and a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.860
So we've got that change up there.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.080
Now the best thing about having a metronome on at the same time is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.220
We can help make that transition from 8th to 16th, back to 8th.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.740
A nice smooth process, with no jitters coming in or out.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.320
And those are some things that you can think about when you're practicing anything.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.120
Not just this groove. Whenever you're practicing something new, 

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:25.878
Think about "how does this affect my ability to land on the beat.

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:28.800
How am I looking at my technique? How does it sound when one hand isn't quite getting it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.547
And finally, how does this help me with subdivisions or any other factor

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.560
So it's just good to think about those things when we're practicing this

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.060
because you can apply that to just about anything

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.160
So there are some benefits of bringing the tempo right down

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.100
And practicing with a metronome

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.380
But for now, let's start to speed things up

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:51.775
So I can show you how this groove can sound when we get it to a higher tempo

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.780
So there we go cajon drummers!

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.636
There is something to satisfy that urge to play something heavy on the cajon

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.700
Or if not, there's a few valuable exercises in there

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.860
When you really bring down that tempo

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.960
And focus on the important things

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.600
So that's where I'll leave it for today

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.620
I'll see you guys probably in a week

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.914
For another cajon lesson

00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:39.895
Until then, enjoy your practice time
