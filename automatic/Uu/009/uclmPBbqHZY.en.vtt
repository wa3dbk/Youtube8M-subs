00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello, how are you in this video? 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.650
 teach how the entry works 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.060
 auxiliary that I put to my car is a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 auxiliary input 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.660
 to present to be bringing discs 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.930
 and the father of this entry 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.780
 is that he adapts 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 from the original sphere 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.210
 Then, in this way, you can already 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.390
 put your cellular ipod because it has some 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 player the entrance is up here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.239
 this is reached to see more or less is the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.239
 entrance is a jack of three and a half 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 and well, it allows you to continue using 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.410
 the controls that brings in the corsa 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.900
 our music in 2002 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.210
 the biggest outside since it is a cd of 2005 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.300
 baby 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.239
 and then let's see how they work 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.239
 telethon we can learn the outside 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.070
 I was surprised 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.070
 the case of the cde 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.840
 and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.289
 it is a yes that has a 13 this follows 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.310
 that's why it's not read by the outside 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:30.100
 you can put a 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 disc in mp3 or with some track that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.819
 do not have recorded anything happened mp3 money 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 then we put the cd to mark error 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.909
 how can you realize now brand 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.909
 error 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.670
 to stay there and that will stay and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.010
 we need now we count the iac 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.180
 the wire 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.180
 who indicated they 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.450
 remains 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 the cable and they really realize the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.360
 cable does not interfere 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.360
 and we put the ipad 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.990
 we connect the other part of the cable 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.990
 we went up 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.599
 but we click 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.069
 you change 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.540
 yes yes 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.120
 very very easy has many of having the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.519
 Cable are because three disks and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.379
 independent of that I really do not 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.640
 like how cars look with others 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.160
 mysteries 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.380
 with cross in a separate way this started 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.380
 in double din stereo you have to 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.510
 buy an adapter and independent to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.180
 Independent harness is also 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.000
 in stereo that just comes between 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.349
 2,000 3,000 people outside regulate the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.510
 my car case you have speakers that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.019
 they are very good it was very strong 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.709
 even having this entry, let's go to 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.709
 do a test 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.760
 and who does not 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.370
 chains 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.060
 it sounds pretty good enough I hope 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.120

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.420
