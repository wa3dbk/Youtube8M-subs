let's<00:00:58.399> get<00:00:58.670> started<00:00:59.379> here<00:01:00.379> are<00:01:00.440> all<00:01:00.649> the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
let's get started here are all the

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.139 
let's get started here are all the
ingredients<00:01:01.429> you<00:01:01.460> will<00:01:01.730> need

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.559 

okay<00:01:08.149> first<00:01:08.420> I'm<00:01:08.569> going<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.899> measure<00:01:09.109> the

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
okay first I'm going to measure the

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.359 
okay first I'm going to measure the
crimping<00:01:11.569> starch<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:12.229> bought<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.130> my

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
crimping starch I bought it from my

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.099 
crimping starch I bought it from my
local<00:01:13.640> Korean<00:01:14.140> grocery<00:01:15.140> store<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.359> think

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
local Korean grocery store so I think

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.740 
local Korean grocery store so I think
people<00:01:18.560> also<00:01:18.679> start<00:01:19.009> online<00:01:19.270> from<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.390> basket

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
people also start online from the basket

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.849 
people also start online from the basket
so<00:01:21.280> how<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.340> crimping<00:01:23.000> start<00:01:23.500> I'm<00:01:24.500> probably

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
so how the crimping start I'm probably

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:31.899 
so how the crimping start I'm probably
using<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.219> metal<00:01:25.549> cup<00:01:27.429> I'm<00:01:28.429> using<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:30.909> there's

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
using a metal cup I'm using the there's

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.380 
using a metal cup I'm using the there's
half<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.209> cup<00:01:33.429> so<00:01:34.429> I<00:01:34.459> don't<00:01:34.849> really<00:01:35.119> want<00:01:35.299> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.559 
hollering to my America the major secret
you<00:02:03.890> know<00:02:04.009> thing<00:02:04.429> about<00:02:04.609> this<00:02:04.700> recipe<00:02:05.269> is<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
you know thing about this recipe is the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.809 
you know thing about this recipe is the
ratio<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.469> water<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:07.129> the<00:02:07.159> crimping

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
ratio of the water to the crimping

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.800 
ratio of the water to the crimping
starch<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:09.709> has<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.069> be<00:02:10.129> 1<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.670> 6<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.630> you're

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
starch and it has to be 1 to 6 so you're

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.420 
starch and it has to be 1 to 6 so you're
leaving<00:02:11.959> one<00:02:12.380> portion<00:02:12.829> out<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.130> curbing

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
leaving one portion out for curbing

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.860 
leaving one portion out for curbing
starch<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.630> 6%<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.650> water<00:02:16.510> what<00:02:17.510> I'm<00:02:17.630> going

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
starch and a 6% of water what I'm going

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.449 
starch and a 6% of water what I'm going
to<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:18.079> is<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.410> mean<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.889> know<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.160> butter

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
to do is I mean you know have butter

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.580 
to do is I mean you know have butter
here<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.359> my<00:02:20.480> magic<00:02:20.780> cup<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.170> use<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.440> two

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
here in my magic cup I use just two

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.129 
here in my magic cup I use just two
measures<00:02:21.950> easier<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.549> way<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.940> think<00:02:23.870> one

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
measures easier that way I think one

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.009 
measures easier that way I think one
portion<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.889> the<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:26.120> once<00:02:26.389> they<00:02:26.569> sell<00:02:26.780> water

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
portion of the like once they sell water

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.789 
portion of the like once they sell water
let's<00:02:27.290> suppose<00:02:27.470> we<00:02:27.650> use<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.069> putting<00:02:28.790> here

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
let's suppose we use and putting here

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.819 
let's suppose we use and putting here
I'll<00:02:30.799> only<00:02:31.040> make<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.489> lap<00:02:31.760> first<00:02:32.829> because

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
I'll only make this lap first because

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.289 
I'll only make this lap first because
from<00:02:34.190> being<00:02:34.430> starch<00:02:34.700> are

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
from being starch are

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.809 
from being starch are
they're<00:02:36.139> super<00:02:36.470> sticky<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.370> know<00:02:37.489> my<00:02:37.639> own

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
they're super sticky you know my own

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.509 
they're super sticky you know my own
together<00:02:38.030> stick<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> pot<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.380> boil<00:02:40.190> them

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and next time keep using my magic up

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.140 
and next time keep using my magic up
together<00:02:43.849> another<00:02:44.150> five<00:02:44.599> hops<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.230> water

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
together another five hops more water

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.849 
together another five hops more water
remember<00:02:47.150> our<00:02:47.359> secret<00:02:47.780> ratios<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:48.680> two

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
remember our secret ratios one two

the bottom of the cup okay I'm I'm you
a<00:03:04.420> nonstick<00:03:05.420> pot<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.050> can<00:03:06.230> see<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.740> said

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
a nonstick pot as you can see I said

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.550 
a nonstick pot as you can see I said
that<00:03:07.550> before<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.810> greatest<00:03:09.230> art<00:03:09.410> is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that before the the greatest art is

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.330 
that before the the greatest art is
super-sticky

so we listen no no stinking coat and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.790 
so we listen no no stinking coat and
turn<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> heat<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.150> high<00:03:17.350> before<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.590> pour

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.100 
turn the heat to high before you pour
into<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.100> pot<00:03:19.340> make<00:03:19.610> sure<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.850> mix<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.210> again

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.840
