00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
fits the other one is heat I always have

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.300 
fits the other one is heat I always have
heat<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:52.690> blast<00:00:52.990> of<00:00:53.200> heat<00:00:53.380> you<00:00:53.950> can<00:00:54.100> see

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
heat little blast of heat you can see

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.979 
heat little blast of heat you can see
from<00:00:54.550> some<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.030> other<00:00:55.210> ones<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.570> took<00:00:55.630> out

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
from some of the other ones I took out

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.960 
from some of the other ones I took out
yet<00:00:56.320> distorts<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.010> plastic<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.579> little<00:00:57.820> bit

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
yet distorts the plastic a little bit

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.780 
yet distorts the plastic a little bit
but<00:00:58.960> that's<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.530> bottom<00:00:59.829> side<00:01:00.040> so<00:01:00.100> who<00:01:00.550> cares

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
but that's the bottom side so who cares

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.120 
but that's the bottom side so who cares
and<00:01:01.780> I<00:01:01.870> guess<00:01:02.050> one<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.410> biggest<00:01:02.590> tricks<00:01:02.980> of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
and I guess one of the biggest tricks of

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.639 
and I guess one of the biggest tricks of
this<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.489> right<00:01:04.390> on<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.689> end<00:01:04.869> there's<00:01:05.379> this

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
this is right on the end there's this

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.380 
this is right on the end there's this
little<00:01:05.979> white<00:01:08.190> piece<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.400> plastic<00:01:09.909> there's<00:01:10.270> a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
little white piece of plastic there's a

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.130 
little white piece of plastic there's a
screw<00:01:10.780> under<00:01:11.080> each<00:01:11.229> side<00:01:11.500> there<00:01:11.800> too<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:13.140> let's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
screw under each side there too so let's

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.990 
screw under each side there too so let's
give<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.650> shot<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.040> see<00:01:15.190> how<00:01:15.370> good<00:01:15.760> this<00:01:15.940> is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
give it a shot and see how good this is

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.630 
give it a shot and see how good this is
gonna<00:01:16.300> actually<00:01:16.540> work

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.830 

I<00:01:29.950> also<00:01:30.950> recommend<00:01:31.490> some<00:01:31.909> kind<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:32.240> magnifying

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
I also recommend some kind of magnifying

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.770 
I also recommend some kind of magnifying
glass<00:01:33.170> because<00:01:33.970> these<00:01:34.970> screws<00:01:35.330> are<00:01:35.510> damn

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
glass because these screws are damn

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.420 
glass because these screws are damn
small<00:01:37.270> now<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.300> just<00:01:38.570> want<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> heat<00:01:38.990> them

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
small now you just want to heat them

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.249 
small now you just want to heat them
just<00:01:40.430> want<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.640> heat<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.970> screw<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:45.110> you'll

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
just want to heat the screw and you'll

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
just want to heat the screw and you'll
just<00:01:45.470> see<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.740> plastic<00:01:45.979> start<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.700> bubble<00:01:47.030> a

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
just see the plastic start to bubble a
