shields from electromagnetic and parent

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.240 
shields from electromagnetic and parent
interference<00:01:11.580> without<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.659> death<00:01:12.900> yes<00:01:13.259> what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
interference without a death yes what

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
interference without a death yes what
did<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> screw<00:01:14.759> go<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:17.540> we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> do

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
did this screw go to we're going to do

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
did this screw go to we're going to do
this<00:01:19.020> screw<00:01:19.670> maybe<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:23.420> looks<00:01:24.420> like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this screw maybe this is it looks like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.179 
this screw maybe this is it looks like
I<00:01:27.140> really<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:28.560> idea<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.039> these

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I really have no idea where all these

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.200 
I really have no idea where all these
screws<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:30.030> into<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.380> pull

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
screws go back into if I just pull

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.289 
screws go back into if I just pull
