the<00:02:29.110> main<00:02:29.290> problem<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.980> combo

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the main problem I have with this combo

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.539 
the main problem I have with this combo
is<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:31.360> uses<00:02:31.630> up<00:02:31.900> your<00:02:31.930> red<00:02:32.320> md<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.220> ends<00:02:33.489> up

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
is it uses up your red md if it ends up

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.270 
is it uses up your red md if it ends up
in<00:02:33.700> grave<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:35.080> uses<00:02:35.260> up<00:02:35.530> two<00:02:35.709> guys<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.190> two

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
in grave and it uses up two guys and two

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.520 
in grave and it uses up two guys and two
hieratic<00:02:36.580> dragons<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.420> tombs<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.500> is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
hieratic dragons of the tombs so this is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.410 
hieratic dragons of the tombs so this is
a<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.799> good<00:02:39.010> combo<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.940> end<00:02:40.120> off<00:02:40.269> with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
a really good combo just to end off with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.009 
a really good combo just to end off with
style<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.959> guess<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.060> only<00:02:43.269> like<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
style I guess but it the only like the

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.690 
style I guess but it the only like the
only<00:02:44.110> good<00:02:44.320> thing<00:02:44.350> about<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.739> combo<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.310> that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
only good thing about this combo is that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.120 
only good thing about this combo is that
it<00:02:46.090> has<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.269> boat<00:02:46.750> VK<00:02:47.110> beater<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.410> start<00:02:48.040> either

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
it has a boat VK beater and start either

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.460 
it has a boat VK beater and start either
