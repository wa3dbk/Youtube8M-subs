00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
lip brush this actually is not a lip

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.460 
brush this is a Billy be brush another
one<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.090> love<00:04:13.329> his<00:04:13.479> brushes<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.379> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
one I love his brushes this is the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.710 
one I love his brushes this is the
number<00:04:14.739> seven<00:04:15.159> but<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:15.639> like<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.000> shape<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.599> it

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
number seven but I like the shape of it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.719 
number seven but I like the shape of it
and<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.049> would<00:04:17.229> use<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.560> for<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.799> lip<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.130> I

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
and I would use it for the lip and I

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.279 
and I would use it for the lip and I
think<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.030> would<00:04:19.120> be<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.239> great<00:04:19.389> alternative<00:04:19.630> if

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
think it would be a great alternative if

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.870 
think it would be a great alternative if
you<00:04:20.440> want<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.709> really<00:04:20.859> blend<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.519> your<00:04:21.700> lip
