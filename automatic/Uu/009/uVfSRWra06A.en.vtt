 as it is good I hope and they are well 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.750
 available even for ios 6 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 Well the reason for this video is for 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 that install the applications but from 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.370
 your computer can not install from 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.980
 install is not working 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.050
 good what they would have to do is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.650
 put this page that they leave in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.020
 description of the video and good 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.850
 they select their application is the same as 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 install in fact this is the directory 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 of urges from here download your 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.040
 applications good selection in your 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.230
 application for example I chose this my 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.800
 put that requested as in installs 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.800
 a captcha 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.730
 Well, I put it and then we go and 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.089
 the download page 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.320
 then this once they have 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.870
 Discharged 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.130
 they will leave a document a file 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:18.250
 but in this way if bread 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 well now to install it this is 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 go back to your device 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.540
 good once you are in your 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.540
 device are going to get like this and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.600

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.540
 they go to sources edit and add 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.540
 good added the following repository 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.100
 I leave them in the description of 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.500
 video so that if they do not reach it 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.610

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.440
 give to add source 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 I 'm going to give you cancel because I already 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.980
 I have 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.650
 once you finish installing it goes 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.690
 to leave this repo 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.690
 they get in and they look for apps and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 good looking for the one that is for ios 5.0 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.870
 here where he tells me to modify them is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.860
 say install install it and it's going to 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.300
 be a little respite 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.000
 good once I finish installing it 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:43.370
 now they are going to open their itunes 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 and good connect their devices 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.760
 good once they have open they go 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.129
 to applications and they're going to look for this 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.709
 its application I for example I already have 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.200
 here one is that I had downloaded and 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.000
 they will simply drag it to the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.270
 Applications 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.070
 and good is already 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.840
 you just synchronize them and here's my 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.820
 good application I have these already 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.180
 I had also downloaded previously 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.390
 good and once you are already here 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.340
 that have synchronized their application here 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.610
 in this part 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.130
 well always mention and I already told 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.710
 its vice 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.300
 and then they want to choose one of the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.830
 applications that have downloaded by 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.120
 example I already had this minecraft 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.120
 it is simply the palomeo 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.140
 and I give to apply 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.800
 and good as you can see out already is 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.800
 synchronizing 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.189
 and good is already finished 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.909
 I got good sync and gave me 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.829
 here in the application here is very 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.319
 good and it would be a way of 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:05.010
 synchronize the applications there is another 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.780
 way but good if you are interested 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.909
 if it does not work for them then follow 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.299
 watching the video so good would close 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.299
 distance 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.190

 well we open it and wait for us 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.000
 detect the eye device and well here we 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.690

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 and here we simply give you here in 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.349
 install and good in your downloads 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.120
 they will leave the applications that 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.560
 have downloaded depending on where 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.539
 have downloaded them if saved in 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.969

 devices unlock it and then because 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.900
 you can see that they also have that 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:20.889
 application that they just synchronized 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.800
