00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.380
 Hello to all your requests in this video, I 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.910
 I'll show you this original technique. 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.230
 weaving on the tail 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.089
 if there are several for you 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.190
 it's hard to do it on high 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.020
 the tail you can use low 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.910
 tail side since my own 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.010
 hair is too short for this 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.590
 hairstyles here I will use the strands on 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.210
 barrettes I have them fixed on the technique 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 which I showed in one of my 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.960
 previous videos start with the fact that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.000
 separate the thin strand of hair right 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 sides of the tail and divide it into three 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.860
 equal parts we will lay external 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.930
 strands on the middle adding new strands 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.300
 hair from the tail to the middle strand braids 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.820
 in other words we will repeat 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.739
 next steps right strand is laid 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 on the central left strand 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.460
 laid on the central hotel to them 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.730
 a thin lock on the left side of the tail 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.110
 and add it to the center strand 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.000
 continuing to weave in this technique we 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.000
 we get the diagonal roe deer 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.140
 fasten the ends of the braids rubber band and our 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 hair ready such a spit great 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.400
 fit her every day is very easy 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.440
 convert the elegant beam to the output 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.180
 we only need to wrap carefully 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.860
 our braid around its base and 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.860
 secure with stealth 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.360
 it remains only to decorate our hairstyle with 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 flower 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.799
 to make us horizontal 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.959
 a ladder take a strand of hair right 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.390
 side of the tail and transfer it to the left 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.549
 side under the tail with this strand we 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 We will interweave our thin hide and seek in 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.269
 while the remaining hair will tie 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.579
 tail so that they do not bother us now we 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.500
 we can weave as well as we pass 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.510
 we will shift our outer strands 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.920
 spit on the inside adding all new 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.739
 hide and seek on the left side 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.659
 this braid can be woven to the tips 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.319
 can be fixed about whipping just 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.319
