this mask um was originally done by

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.769 
this mask um was originally done by
rubies<00:00:15.139> back<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.560> 2004<00:00:17.480> I've<00:00:18.480> done<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
rubies back I think in 2004 I've done a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.750 
rubies back I think in 2004 I've done a
lot<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> changes<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.800> mask<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
lot of changes on this mask to make it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.140 
lot of changes on this mask to make it
more<00:00:20.939> film<00:00:21.359> accurate<00:00:22.820> originally<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> mask

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
more film accurate originally the mask

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.730 
more film accurate originally the mask
had<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:25.070> fake<00:00:26.070> teeth<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:28.050> area<00:00:28.439> here

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
had a fake teeth and the this area here

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.930 
had a fake teeth and the this area here
so<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> trimmed<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.920> give<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> more

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so I trimmed that out to give it a more

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.479 
so I trimmed that out to give it a more
realistic<00:00:33.239> approach<00:00:34.070> I<00:00:35.149> kind<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:37.190> trimmed<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
realistic approach I kind of trimmed the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.350 
realistic approach I kind of trimmed the
left<00:00:38.790> eye<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:40.370> right<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.120> a

exactly<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> same<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> front<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
exactly the same as the front of the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.820 
exactly the same as the front of the
mask<00:01:40.640> as<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> see

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.530 

that's<00:01:46.830> how<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.250> looks<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.360> did<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that's how it looks now I think I did a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.480 
that's how it looks now I think I did a
pretty<00:01:51.600> good<00:01:51.869> job<00:01:52.340> redoing<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.549> mask<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
pretty good job redoing this mask I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
pretty good job redoing this mask I
think<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.549> could<00:01:56.729> put<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
think I could put it on for you if you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:22.020 
think I could put it on for you if you
just<00:01:58.320> give<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.680> second<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.369> hold<00:01:59.610> on

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.260 

as<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.080> much<00:02:23.230> more<00:02:23.470> effective

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
as you can see it's much more effective

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.600 
as you can see it's much more effective
this<00:02:25.270> way<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.460> have<00:02:27.580> my

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
this way I don't know if I have my

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.170 
this way I don't know if I have my
camera<00:02:28.150> right<00:02:28.800> oops<00:02:30.900> sorry<00:02:31.900> about<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.140> guys

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
camera right oops sorry about that guys

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.970 
camera right oops sorry about that guys
but<00:02:34.180> as<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.440> see<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:37.360> looks<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.840> better

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.220 

so<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.190> have<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.340> rubies<00:02:42.820> deluxe<00:02:43.600> mask

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
so if you have a rubies deluxe mask

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.820 
so if you have a rubies deluxe mask
I<00:02:44.260> suggest<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:46.200> customize<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.650> did

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
I suggest you customize it like I did

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.920 
I suggest you customize it like I did
mine<00:02:48.540> because<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.720> makes<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.170> look<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> lot<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
mine because it makes it look a lot a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
mine because it makes it look a lot a
lot<00:02:52.930> better<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:55.440> unfortunately<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.709> next

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
lot better and unfortunately the next

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.970 
lot better and unfortunately the next
step<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.580> uh<00:02:58.260> probably<00:02:59.260> put<00:02:59.440> some<00:02:59.620> foam<00:02:59.830> in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
step is to uh probably put some foam in

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380 
step is to uh probably put some foam in
the<00:03:00.100> back<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> head<00:03:00.610> because<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.150> mask

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the back to the head because this mask

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.229 
the back to the head because this mask
is<00:03:01.630> pretty<00:03:01.989> large<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.770> usually<00:03:03.489> put<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> few<00:03:04.030> bags

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
is pretty large I usually put a few bags

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.920 
is pretty large I usually put a few bags
to<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.570> back<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:04.989> head<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.130> my<00:03:06.250> face<00:03:06.459> can

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to the back of the head so my face can

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.979 
to the back of the head so my face can
stick<00:03:07.930> out<00:03:08.370> properly<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.860> fix<00:03:12.010> that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
stick out properly so I got to fix that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.810 
stick out properly so I got to fix that
so<00:03:13.989> this<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.290> pretty<00:03:14.500> much<00:03:14.560> how<00:03:14.709> my<00:03:15.400> Rudy's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
so this is pretty much how my Rudy's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.290 
so this is pretty much how my Rudy's
mask<00:03:16.090> looks<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.950> Ruby's<00:03:18.430> mask<00:03:18.670> I'd<00:03:18.970> have

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
mask looks and for Ruby's mask I'd have

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.990 
mask looks and for Ruby's mask I'd have
to<00:03:19.480> say<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.530> best

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
to say it's one of the best

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.050 
to say it's one of the best
