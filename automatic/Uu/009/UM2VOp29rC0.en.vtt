was<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.700> interesting<00:01:14.909> i<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
was very interesting i think a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
was very interesting i think a
positional<00:01:16.710> game<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.280> Balotelli<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.240> i<00:01:18.330> have

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
positional game with Balotelli so i have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.179 
positional game with Balotelli so i have
a<00:01:18.689> winning<00:01:18.930> position<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.740> blundered

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
a winning position and just blundered

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
a winning position and just blundered
this<00:01:20.400> intermediate<00:01:21.299> checks<00:01:21.659> i<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this intermediate checks i think it was

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
this intermediate checks i think it was
really<00:01:22.650> nice<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.220> place<00:01:23.430> another<00:01:23.759> Grand
