00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
finished my build 100% so I figured I

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.670 
finished my build 100% so I figured I
just<00:00:05.879> make<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> really<00:00:06.569> quick<00:00:07.350> walk<00:00:07.649> through

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
a 97 acura integra redid the alternator

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.540 
a 97 acura integra redid the alternator
now<00:00:13.679> has<00:00:13.980> 170<00:00:14.790> amp<00:00:14.910> high<00:00:15.120> output<00:00:16.100> all<00:00:17.100> excess

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
now has 170 amp high output all excess

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.439 
now has 170 amp high output all excess
power<00:00:17.789> big<00:00:18.000> three

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
power big three

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.269 
power big three
everything<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.140> zero<00:00:19.350> gauge<00:00:19.560> excess<00:00:19.920> power<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
everything is zero gauge excess power in

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.580 
everything is zero gauge excess power in
this<00:00:20.400> car<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> hood<00:00:21.720> battery<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.109> did<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
this car for the hood battery I did a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.150 
this car for the hood battery I did a
d50<00:00:23.519> 100<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.180> great<00:00:25.170> battery<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:25.949> liked

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
and the this huge behemoth of a trunk

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.180 
and the this huge behemoth of a trunk
got<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> rep<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.430> sound<00:00:39.059> cubed<00:00:39.390> stickers<00:00:40.190> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
got to rep my sound cubed stickers and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.970 
got to rep my sound cubed stickers and
this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> trunk<00:00:42.059> looks<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.450> now

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
this is what the trunk looks like now

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360 
this is what the trunk looks like now
completely<00:00:43.980> did<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> uh<00:00:45.890> there<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> the

like<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:52.980> talking<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.309> zero<00:00:53.699> gauge

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
like I was talking about zero gauge

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.860 
like I was talking about zero gauge
excess<00:00:54.449> power<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> trunk

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
excess power so that's the trunk

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.639 
excess power so that's the trunk
sometimes<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
sometimes now with a lot of this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.439 
sometimes now with a lot of this
paneling<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> takes<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.789> times<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> clothes

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
paneling it takes two times the clothes

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.390 
paneling it takes two times the clothes
let's<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.680> close<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.340> time<00:01:02.579> there

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
let's see up close the first time there

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.649 
let's see up close the first time there
now<00:01:05.400> here's<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> inside<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> ripped

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
apart the old wall redid it this is what

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
apart the old wall redid it this is what
it<00:01:08.760> looks<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> new<00:01:10.680> all

two rockford fosgate r16 and a half's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.340 
two rockford fosgate r16 and a half's
and<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.979> Power<00:01:26.610> Acoustik<00:01:27.140> tweets<00:01:28.140> up

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and then two Power Acoustik tweets up

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
and then two Power Acoustik tweets up
top<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.310> Power<00:01:29.579> Acoustik<00:01:29.930> kind<00:01:30.930> of

them I hid one over there and the other

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
them I hid one over there and the other
ones<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> over<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.520> then

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
ones kind of over on this side well then

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.830 
ones kind of over on this side well then
that<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.090> HDC<00:01:37.070> 318<00:01:38.070> port<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.119> too<00:01:39.329> small<00:01:39.600> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that is the HDC 318 port is too small I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410 
that is the HDC 318 port is too small I
know<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.860> screwed<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> port<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.299> bit

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
know I screwed up the port a little bit

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.069 
know I screwed up the port a little bit
it's<00:01:43.409> still<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.220> mean<00:01:44.430> I've<00:01:44.579> tuned<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
it's still I mean I've tuned it

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's still I mean I've tuned it
specifically<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
specifically for a bit of a you know a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.660 
specifically for a bit of a you know a
higher<00:01:47.810> note<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> still<00:01:50.040> gets<00:01:50.250> low<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
higher note but it still gets low and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.800 
higher note but it still gets low and
I'm<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> make<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> quick<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.360> demo

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I'm going to make a quick little demo
