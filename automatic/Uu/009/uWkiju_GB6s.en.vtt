miners took place of rock raiders you
can<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> tell<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> yeah<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.230> like

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
can kind of tell so yeah I really like

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.720 
can kind of tell so yeah I really like
his<00:00:52.710> drill<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.850> detailed<00:00:54.270> thought

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
his drill this really detailed thought

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
his drill this really detailed thought
though<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> probably<00:00:56.969> didn't<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.600> Lego<00:00:57.930> long

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
though it probably didn't take Lego long

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.610 
though it probably didn't take Lego long
to<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.449> yeah<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.750> he's<00:01:01.170> holding<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
to make this yeah so he's holding the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.450 
to make this yeah so he's holding the
switch<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.290> use<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.860> chop<00:01:05.220> up

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
switch and it's gonna use it to chop up

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.210 
switch and it's gonna use it to chop up
the<00:01:05.729> crystal<00:01:06.570> pink<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:08.210> critical<00:01:09.210> King<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
the crystal pink now critical King is

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
the crystal pink now critical King is
really<00:01:11.220> cool<00:01:11.400> he<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.360> bunch<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> crystals<00:01:13.260> all

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
really cool he has bunch of crystals all

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.929 
really cool he has bunch of crystals all
over<00:01:13.409> his<00:01:13.740> body<00:01:13.890> he's<00:01:14.280> made<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> rock<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
over his body he's made of rock and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.169 
over his body he's made of rock and
crystals<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.900> guess<00:01:16.610> his<00:01:17.610> mouth<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.210> open

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.190 

like<00:01:24.179> so<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:25.679> let's<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.460> say<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.719> minor<00:01:27.929> get

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like so and let's just say the minor get

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
like so and let's just say the minor get
strapped<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:29.069> blows<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> crystal

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
strapped in and he blows the crystal

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.980 
strapped in and he blows the crystal
coming<00:01:30.929> up<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.259> these<00:01:31.409> data<00:01:31.679> mine<00:01:32.240> yeah<00:01:33.240> he

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
coming up with these data mine yeah he

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
coming up with these data mine yeah he
has<00:01:34.079> spikes<00:01:34.469> all<00:01:34.709> over<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.280> find<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
has spikes all over which I find is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.279 
has spikes all over which I find is
really<00:01:36.000> cool<00:01:36.209> over<00:01:36.390> pieces<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> crystals

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
really cool over pieces the crystals

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.880 
really cool over pieces the crystals
make<00:01:40.469> him<00:01:40.679> shiny<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.880> cool<00:01:42.409> if<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.709> also

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
make him shiny and cool if you can also

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:55.960 
make him shiny and cool if you can also
hold<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:49.380> shame<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.219 

stupid<00:01:56.970> thing<00:01:58.070> pieces<00:01:59.070> fall<00:01:59.369> off<00:02:00.049> these<00:02:01.049> are

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
stupid thing pieces fall off these are

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.270 
stupid thing pieces fall off these are
very<00:02:01.439> easily<00:02:03.680> yeah<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.830> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> hard<00:02:05.220> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
very easily yeah it's kind of hard to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
very easily yeah it's kind of hard to
put<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:08.039> works<00:02:09.140> it's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
put them on but and then it works it's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.650 
put them on but and then it works it's
kind<00:02:10.350> of<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> Bionicle<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.569> have

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
kind of like a Bionicle because I have

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660 
kind of like a Bionicle because I have
some<00:02:12.840> technique<00:02:13.260> pieces<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.720> legs

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
some technique pieces in here and legs

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.270 
some technique pieces in here and legs
movables<00:02:17.670> or<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.209> arms<00:02:18.800> yeah<00:02:19.800> that's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
movables or the arms yeah that's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.570 
movables or the arms yeah that's
basically<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.819> for<00:02:20.940> today<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:23.160> got
