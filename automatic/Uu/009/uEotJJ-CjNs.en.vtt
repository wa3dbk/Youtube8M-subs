this<00:00:57.929> does<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> Kirk<00:00:59.690> blk<00:01:00.690> 7<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this does have the Kirk blk 7 which is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.740 
this does have the Kirk blk 7 which is
the<00:01:01.829> L<00:01:02.129> bracket<00:01:04.850> can't<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.000> video<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.630> L

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the L bracket can't do video with the L

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.900 
the L bracket can't do video with the L
bracket<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.770> microphone<00:01:08.009> won't<00:01:08.640> plug

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
bracket because my microphone won't plug

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.240 
bracket because my microphone won't plug
in<00:01:09.090> yet<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.899> don't<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> L<00:01:10.740> bracket<00:01:11.100> for

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
in yet so I don't use the L bracket for

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.740 
in yet so I don't use the L bracket for
video<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.270> landscapes

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
video that's pretty much for landscapes

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.200 
video that's pretty much for landscapes
only<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.280> landscape<00:01:14.729> camera<00:01:15.060> that's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
only that's my landscape camera that's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.279 
only that's my landscape camera that's
the<00:01:15.450> Pentax<00:01:16.229> VA<00:01:16.770> star<00:01:17.220> 16<00:01:17.820> millisecond<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> 15

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
the Pentax VA star 16 millisecond to 15

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.199 
the Pentax VA star 16 millisecond to 15
so<00:01:19.950> there's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.190> size<00:01:20.460> comparison<00:01:21.679> okay

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
so there's a size comparison okay

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.900 
so there's a size comparison okay
look<00:01:24.209> at<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.860> makes<00:01:26.069> that<00:01:26.220> camera<00:01:26.459> look<00:01:26.610> huge

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
look at that makes that camera look huge

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.059 
look at that makes that camera look huge
the<00:01:27.119> L<00:01:27.209> bracket<00:01:27.539> those<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.780> power<00:01:27.869> foot<00:01:28.229> so

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
the L bracket those in power foot so

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.370 
the L bracket those in power foot so
there's<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.550> for<00:01:30.360> size<00:01:30.569> comparison<00:01:30.599> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there's that for size comparison so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
there's that for size comparison so
there's<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.899> better<00:01:34.110> yeah<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.429> there's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
there's the get better yeah so there's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.680 
there's the get better yeah so there's
the<00:01:35.910> 21<00:01:36.890> tiny<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.099> is<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> great<00:01:38.729> focal

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
the 21 tiny that is what a great focal

millimeter filter on there so it's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.789

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.989 
driver I mean I like the 31 and it's a
1/8<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:40.289> it's<00:06:40.409> a<00:06:40.499> bigger<00:06:40.680> lens<00:06:40.949> but<00:06:41.729> it's<00:06:41.849> not

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
1/8 and it's a bigger lens but it's not

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.619 
1/8 and it's a bigger lens but it's not
like<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.300> 16<00:06:42.840> to<00:06:43.050> 50<00:06:43.409> zoom<00:06:43.680> so<00:06:44.669> yeah<00:06:45.330> maybe<00:06:45.539> a

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
like a 16 to 50 zoom so yeah maybe a

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:46.969 
like a 16 to 50 zoom so yeah maybe a
little<00:06:45.810> faster<00:06:46.139> aperture<00:06:46.499> would<00:06:46.590> be<00:06:46.710> nice<00:06:46.830> I

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
little faster aperture would be nice I

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.140 
little faster aperture would be nice I
mean<00:06:47.069> if<00:06:47.189> they<00:06:47.279> came<00:06:47.460> out<00:06:47.580> with<00:06:47.699> a<00:06:47.729> 20

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
mean if they came out with a 20

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.489 
mean if they came out with a 20
millimeter<00:06:50.090> 2.0<00:06:51.090> I'd<00:06:51.599> probably<00:06:52.020> jump<00:06:52.319> all

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
millimeter 2.0 I'd probably jump all

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.320 
millimeter 2.0 I'd probably jump all
over<00:06:52.529> that<00:06:52.740> but<00:06:53.279> probably<00:06:53.759> have<00:06:53.879> both<00:06:54.060> right

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.629 
over that but probably have both right
