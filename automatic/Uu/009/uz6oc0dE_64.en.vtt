 the fanatic and good has already been designed 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.170
 today I bring you a short and fast video 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.540
 and simple that is about what you think 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.550
 what will happen to the arm of the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.809
 parrot is simply that I think what 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.030
 leave in the comments 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.220
 and now I am going to tell you my opinion is 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.949
 say what I think will happen very well 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.500
 I 've been looking at William and you 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.070
 I will say what it says about the cope 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.870
 open or I'm worth it then ate at the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 ope open or me a devil fruit 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.790
 type for media that gives you the power 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.940
 to make modifications at will 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.989
 within the doubt determined area outside 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.689
 what those who remain 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.570
 stuck in your role that is the room 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.780
 locked that can be considered 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 in quotes patients in a room 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.570
 operations is to say I am now 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.869
 leaving in children about fighting and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.520
 all that I what I believe as he does with 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.439
 some soldiers of the navy who 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 He tears off his head and changes them 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 cannons 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.020
 of the marine and thallium I think what 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.940
 will do is to hook his arm again 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 as if nothing had happened is to say 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.620
 as a kind of tables for example 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 is not fighting now against a 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.810
 flamingo vale don flamingo 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.430
 attack attacked in flamingo 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.670
 if you have seen in the past 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 chapters he was nailed a sword a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 flamingo but it turned out that it was a 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.000
 doll is to say that they would have to play 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.910
 with a little bit of advantage to both of you you know 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 with flamingo is a doll I think what 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.070
 You can also have the advantage of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.900
 restore your body parts because 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.110
 if I would not be very unequal to give the fight 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.770
 Y 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.050
 like the 12 now does not stop like that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 the fights has to be an epic fight 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.800
 if it would not be a disaster for me apart 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.960
 all when it starts something to a character 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.500
 for example with zhang makes it more team 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.730
 for example be next lost his arm 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 protecting light and that was ripped 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.220
 how is it called a king of these sailors not 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.260
 I think all of them and I had to 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 pull the arm some character be 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.090
 simply that it is cut and it is already 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.099
 that's why it's my opinion leaving the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.340
 what do you think about what will happen in the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.590
 comments and before leaving I would like 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.030
 tell you a curiosity that I have seen 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 in the last chapter that is the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.829
 Mr. pink's weakness is to say this 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.599
 character belongs to the family of 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.209
 golf team friend and before the truth 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.150
 is that he has made a big change because 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.180
 before he was tall handsome 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.069
 you're not quite trained and such and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.169
 now he is underweight and takes advantage of a 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.609
 a lot of the aunts is that I do not understand and 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.389
 apart I understand how the aunts 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.060
 You may like something like that if it was before 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.460
 but good thing is that his weakness 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.830
 is 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.420
 when he sees a helpless animal that 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.210
 need help help stay a little 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.600
 argentino good when he needs help what 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.450
 What Mr. Pin does is go help him is 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.640
 say he does not care about his life because if 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.230
 you have seen in the last chapter clear 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.420
 is that if you have not seen it 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 you do not know what I'm talking about but 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.640
 in the last chapter franklin fight 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.910
 against Mr. pin and frank and he throws a 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.610
 attack a cat unintentionally and the lord 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.560
 end is put there he does not care and they give 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.600
 whole back but he does not care what 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.880
 important is to defend the cat is the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.090
 simple curiosity that I do not know 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.800
 something quite shocking appeared that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.350
 a ruthless weapon like that that 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.239
 belongs to a ruthless family can 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.340
 have such a sensitive weakness and so 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.410
 cookie to say it somehow 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.690
 well said all this I hope that you 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.400
 Like to sign up if the next one 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.100
 week I found out with a theory that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.389
 is going to leave open-mouthed a greeting and 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.389
 until another nothing more 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.180
 to
