00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.189
 despite the fact that motorola kush laz 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:10.690
 Russian 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.250
 as a result, do not return yet 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 going I could not pass by 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.320
 opportunities to hold in your hands 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 new parties from June 4 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.859
 the company calls this smartphone the most 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.889
 powerful in the world and he is really powerful 

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:32.070
 both externally and internally with him 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 installed chip nvidia tegra 2 familiar to us already 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.800
 passport he gave jeep elbow 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.410
 collapse 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 only installed here 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.530
 really capacious battery for 1930 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 milliampere hour 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.910
 therefore, he can work further from 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.609
 sockets 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.909
 10 hours and even more in active mode 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.210
 testing 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.920
 no less impression 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.450
 produces th size night ahead of the car 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.020
 more permissions than any other 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 existing android background 960x540 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.449
 points almost like the last background ah 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.239
 behind there is a curious window to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.590
 locking combined with 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.850
 fingerprint scanner especially 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 paranoid mates can 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.829
 use your transition instead 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.710
 his own park is not stable 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.710
 you can do a lot of work like this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.630
 but overall the external atheist is not 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.220
 represents nothing special 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.200
 although not bad in the hand and plastic pleases 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.330
 qualities 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.710
 but iron is just iron without 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.340
 bad but nobody needs 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 Android 2.2 is installed here. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440
 shells motta dishes 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.160
 a bunch of useful widgets 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.210
 dimensions that can be changed directly to 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 liturgies 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 In general, I liked the device very much 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.680
 original with its special 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.460
 interesting chips and the main thing is the first 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.009
 smartphone with dual core chip 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.440
 who worked for me a whole working 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.250
 day 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.000
 and besides the very a 3 4 b motorola introduced 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.040
 a kind of bonus is such a docking station 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.160
 which turns a smartphone 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 a laptop 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.409
 You can connect mice to it and 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.219
 keyboards later however full 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.339
 the laptop does not do so because of his fault 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:16.389
 no law 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.120
 but the whole load falls 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.730
 on power and nvidia tegra 2 thousand inside motorola atrix 4g 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.919
 and even despite the failure of the disconnecting 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.439
 full trades 3 6 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.549
 heavy site on it tosses 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.299
 barely barely 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.599
 new ideas are interesting but to 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.180
 unfortunately not viable
