take you outside the map or on top of
the<00:01:16.080> building<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.070> does<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the building because it does that it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
the building because it does that it
does<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.659> random<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> doesn't<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.680> a

does this at random it doesn't have a
definite<00:01:20.340> spot<00:01:20.729> where<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> land

definite spot where you're going to land

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
definite spot where you're going to land
we<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> most<00:01:22.799> part<00:01:22.920> either

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we do it but for the most part either

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.210 
we do it but for the most part either
land<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> building<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.390> outside<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> map

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
land on a building or outside of the map

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
land on a building or outside of the map
so<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.640> outside<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.090> map<00:01:27.270> able

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so then when you're outside the map able

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
so then when you're outside the map able
to<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.320> plant<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.619> tack<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:30.150> much

friend arlys jr. was trying it he
actually<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.740> able<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> top<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
actually was able to get on top of the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
actually was able to get on top of the
whole<00:01:45.329> map<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> Osprey<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
whole map because the Osprey would just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
whole map because the Osprey would just
it<00:01:47.850> took<00:01:48.030> them<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> different<00:01:48.450> route<00:01:48.780> than<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it took them a different route than it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
it took them a different route than it
what<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> took<00:01:49.530> me<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.610> um<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> most<00:01:51.780> part

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
what it took me but um for the most part

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
what it took me but um for the most part
you'll<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.590> you'll<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.040> somewhere<00:01:53.430> where

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you'll get you'll get somewhere where

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
you'll get you'll get somewhere where
you're<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.750> supposed<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> guess<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you're not supposed to be I guess you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
you're not supposed to be I guess you
can<00:01:55.799> say<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.270> some

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
can say you're going to get in in some

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
can say you're going to get in in some
type<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> glitch<00:01:58.350> either<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> map<00:01:59.040> or

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
type of glitch either out of the map or

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.429 
type of glitch either out of the map or
on<00:01:59.430> top<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> map<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> most<00:02:01.320> part

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on top of the map and for the most part

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.980 
on top of the map and for the most part
you<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.490> usually<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.570> doesn't<00:02:03.719> drop

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you don't really usually it doesn't drop

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
you don't really usually it doesn't drop
you<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.290> back<00:02:04.860> inside<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.399> map<00:02:05.549> that's<00:02:05.759> very

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you off back inside the map that's very

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
you off back inside the map that's very
rare<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.659> does<00:02:06.750> happen<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> does

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
rare but it does happen so if it does

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
rare but it does happen so if it does
happen<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.459> try<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.700> again<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:09.479> get

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
happen just try it again don't get

now<00:02:11.200> right<00:02:11.410> here<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.710> how<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.950> get<00:02:12.160> under<00:02:12.460> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
now right here is how you get under the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.730 
now right here is how you get under the
map<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.420> walk<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.720> any<00:02:13.930> edge<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> map

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
map you can walk to any edge of the map

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.710 
map you can walk to any edge of the map
except<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.370> west<00:02:15.760> side<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.510> map

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
except for the west side of the map

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.960 
except for the west side of the map
because<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.410> will<00:02:17.620> fall<00:02:17.890> off<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.760> it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
because you will fall off and you and it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.940 
because you will fall off and you and it
won't<00:02:19.180> kill<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> you'll<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.380> keep<00:02:20.530> falling

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
won't kill you you'll just keep falling

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.790 
won't kill you you'll just keep falling
forever<00:02:21.100> but<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.360> walk<00:02:22.540> off<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:23.140> any<00:02:23.380> other

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
forever but if you walk off of any other

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
forever but if you walk off of any other
edge<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> map<00:02:24.670> you're<00:02:25.270> able<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.930> go

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
edge of the map you're able to just go

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.440 
edge of the map you're able to just go
right<00:02:26.470> under<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> map<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.280> go<00:02:27.670> actually<00:02:28.270> back

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
right under the map and go actually back

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.600 
right under the map and go actually back
into<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.930> mat<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.500> under<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.460> can

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
into the mat but be under it you can

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.510 
into the mat but be under it you can
kill<00:02:30.850> people<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.360> really<00:02:31.690> fun<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.170> and

kill people it's really fun to do and
Arlie<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.820> right<00:02:34.180> there<00:02:34.360> he's<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.690> top<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
Arlie is right there he's on top of the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.020 
Arlie is right there he's on top of the
map<00:02:35.350> he's<00:02:35.800> able<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.130> just<00:02:36.400> jump<00:02:36.580> right<00:02:36.700> down

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
map he's able to just jump right down

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.050 
map he's able to just jump right down
and<00:02:37.270> um<00:02:37.540> get<00:02:38.230> out<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> map<00:02:38.710> but<00:02:39.460> um<00:02:39.640> I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and um get out of the map but um I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.820 
and um get out of the map but um I
recommend<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.990> always<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> grenade

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
many places and on any map that is you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.930 
many places and on any map that is you
can<00:02:47.530> always<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:47.980> stuck<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.520> want<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> have
