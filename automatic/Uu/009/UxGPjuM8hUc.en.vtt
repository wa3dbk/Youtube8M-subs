00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.610
 Many people who want to increase their muscle mass do not know how to start their 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.799
 training 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.869
 The first thing you should keep in mind to increase muscle mass is that they should 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.039
 to have a training plan 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.970
 oo how much and where to train 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.640
 Here are some tips for a workout that helps increase muscle mass 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 Quick 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.689
 your training has to be brief 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.999
 your sessions to gain muscle mass should not last more than 45 minutes 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.190
 the fundamental reason is that if the training is hard enough 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 after 30 minutes of session your body starts to secrete cortisol 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 a catabolic hormone that destroys your muscle tissue 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.190
 another reason why training should not be long is because it is 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.310
 impossible that a training is very long and very hard at the same time 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.600
 when after a session of 45 minutes you feel that you have stayed with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.640
 want more 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.010
 you should ask yourself if you have really trained hard enough 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.050
 multitude of scientific studies show that a single series made 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.050
 with maximum intensity is more effective than many series 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.560
 your training has to be hard 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.880
 when I speak of hardness I mean the intensity of the series that you make 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.780
 that is to say 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 to the limit 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.380
 that you take your effort in each of them 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.780
 It is essential that your system interprets each series as a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.110
 external aggression that you can not cope with your current resources 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.910
 your brain will only send the signal is to make more muscle grow even 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.479
 Thinning your muscle mass 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 if you have enough reasons for it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.310
 the reason must be that your body needs more muscle to be able to 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.110
 endure all the hard work that we are forcing you to do and thus give 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 place to the muscular 'u' ment 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.340
 your training must be infrequent 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.410
 if the intensity and exercises chosen are adequate 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.490
 You should rest a minimum of 48 hours between your sessions 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.810
 that time is what your body uses to create muscle tissue 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.789
 do not do more than three weekly muscle training sessions 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.719
 your training has to be progressive 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.729
 It is very important that you increase the load of your workouts as you 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.759
 increase your levels of strength 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.049
 so it is necessary to increase the weights used in your exercises in the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.999
 when you are able to perform the planned repetitions with the 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.029
 correct technique and so you can still think about muscle mass 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.859
 your training should include basic exercises 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.789
 the basic exercises are those that involve several muscle groups in 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:40.700
 its execution 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.779
 squats 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.589
 deadlift bench press dominated 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.359
 These types of exercises are those that have the greatest impact on the increase 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.069
 of the levels of your anabolic hormones 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.999
 They are the toughest and sure ones that you least like but also the most 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.019
 effective to increase muscle mass 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.290
 do not get carried away by the feeling of congestion that the exercises produce 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.269
 isolation 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.930
 those that involve a single muscle group since it is only a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.629
 transient state in which a greater blood volume is in a group 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.909
 concrete muscle 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 but it has nothing to do with the gain of muscle mass 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.879
 6 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 your training should include leg exercises 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.209
 although your main objective may be the waist muscle improvement for 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:24.870
 above 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.669
 never forget to train your legs 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.849
 again it is essential for your body to secrete its famous hormones 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.699
 anabolic testosterone and growth hormone to the maximum of its 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.309
 possibilities 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:41.589
 includes at least one basic and intense leg exercise in one of your routines 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.779
 weekly 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:46.609
 the squat can be a very good option but if you do not have clear the 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.219
 This technique is not performed by xcom / and free weight since 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.009
