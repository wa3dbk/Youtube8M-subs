I think I learned a long time ago that
part<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> rock-and-roll<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> middle

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
part of rock-and-roll I'm in the middle

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
part of rock-and-roll I'm in the middle
entertainers<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.860> bottom<00:01:32.340> line<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:34.700> some

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
entertainers the bottom line so some

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
entertainers the bottom line so some
people<00:01:36.030> walk<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.780> stage<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.470> doesn't<00:01:37.530> matter

them something that's just a little bit
more<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.429> like<00:01:47.670> Elvis<00:01:48.360> always<00:01:48.869> always

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
important so you know it's just a matter

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.820 
important so you know it's just a matter
of<00:02:00.179> picking<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.929> like<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.380> finding

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.279 
of picking out what you like in finding
your<00:02:01.950> style<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.810> separate

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
your style so that you kind of separate

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.010 
your style so that you kind of separate
yourself<00:02:04.679> from<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:06.119> other<00:02:06.149> guys<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> band

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
you know though I have been thinking

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
you know though I have been thinking
about<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.280> doing<00:02:12.030> something<00:02:12.360> where

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
about to kind of doing something where

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.180 
about to kind of doing something where
the<00:02:12.720> band<00:02:12.930> starts<00:02:13.290> wearing<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> same<00:02:13.920> thing

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.270 
the band starts wearing the same thing
again<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.299> try<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.700> but

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
again just to try it you know but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.300 
again just to try it you know but
I<00:02:19.340> don't<00:02:19.610> know<00:02:19.670> we'll<00:02:20.060> see
