00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:10.170
 Mr. President, fellow Aldermen to the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.660
 The public accompanies us through the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 internet those who are honoring clan 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.869
 presence in plenary 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 I mean that today they can bring 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.930
 here the forum the subject is of interest 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.359
 of the workers of our city the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 councilor adilson mariano when 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.480
 past legislature along with the other 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 councilors of that house 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.930
 we tried through a commission 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 which will discuss the issue of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 to seek a meaning to rescue is to save 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 in the case at the time the levy jobs only 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 Followed very well we did not have 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.440
 very successful in raising awareness of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 authorities who could effectively 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.290
 have some pen power, and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.270
 keep that manufacturing park running 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.439
 the reality is the moment of bankruptcy 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.060
 company 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 but this week that passed 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.479
 they did exactly did exactly six 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 months that the bankrupt bankruptcy was decreed 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.600
 to win and to seek six months 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:37.770
 in the mean time absolutely nothing 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 happened in the sense of auctioning the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.320
 assets and pay the debts that basically 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.500
 are with bank creditors but very 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.479
 especially with workers 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 of that company 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 in the meantime it is effectively 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:04.530
 there was a request from one of a group that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.500
 was a competitor of busscar to rent 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.300
 assets by way of payment of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.580
 11 rent would generate jobs again 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 jobs that are actually 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.830
 those of those workers who 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.230
 been there for years and now 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.690
 are there in the informal market 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.630
 working on other issues 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.150
 wasting the expertise accumulated by 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
 long time 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 so we are in a situation 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.170
 For six months nothing has happened. 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.910
 nothing works, nothing works 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.620
 it is not sold for payment of the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:50.630
 debts and also last weekend the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:55.400
 judge denies justice denies giving a 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.860
 contrary to the allocation of that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.110
 industrial park 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.950
 then we are there in a situation of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.870
 impasse 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.920
 that manufacturing park will not 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.710
 to preserve 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.050
 if it is not used that is sold from 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.990
 and the debts paid with the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.480
 workers, mainly 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:21.730
 rented to those who want to grow 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.930
 we seem to have been denouncing 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.690
 equipment was stolen the president 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.320
 with his benevolence plus a means 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 minute 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.970
 the equipment has not assumed projects 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.110
 are there more 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.020
 there were even many things for one were 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 included and taken to companies that 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:49.340
 are supplying spare parts for 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.650
 buses there and this will all depreciate the 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.910
 capital when it is effectively 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.880
 sold 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.060
 that heritage is worth no more than the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.700
 value of your land and we lose in 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.250
 factory park which can be 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.020
 being could be being managed by 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.630
 anyone but jobs would be 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.209
 ours are Joinville and the collection 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.250
 It would also be in our city so I want 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.709
 bring this issue up again 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.430
 so we can follow closely 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.280
 this process that is hampered in the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.700
 justice 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.700
 thank you
