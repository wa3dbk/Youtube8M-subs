00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.760
 look at the eyes of these people they 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.540
 different colors blue green hazel 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.540
 why are they all different colors 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 question-answer eyes eyes one of the most 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.390
 complex human organs 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 here they are located in front of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 heads and work together to create 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.430
 three-dimensional multi-color image 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 the world around us but the eyes are not only 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 provide the mind with pictures but they 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 capture our imagination they play 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 important role in mutual attraction 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 help us communicate with each other by 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 Essentially this is due to the iris 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.379
 ambient pupil 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.799
 which regulate the amount 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.379
 light entering the eye and light 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.510
 defines a pigment called melanin 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.309
 as a result of high concentration 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 melanin eyes turn brown 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 from dark brown to light brown but 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 cause of light colored eyes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.380
 for example blue and green 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.470
 is not just a low level 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 galanina when in the iris 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.420
 enters the color he faces 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.479
 some cells and scatters blue 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.710
 part of the light spectrum so when the light 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 iris comes out of the eye 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.630
 it seems blue is interesting what exactly 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.250
 the same process takes place in the atmosphere 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.070
 land when the sky turns blue 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 why iris color mainly 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 way to protect for melanin pigment 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 which absorbs the pernicious 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.159
 ultraviolet light is the same pigment 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 which colors and protects our skin 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.680
 in his eyes he needs to protect 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.380
 retina some people have different eyes 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 colors it may be the result of the disease 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 eye damage or on secular and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 feature 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 but whatever the reason for the difference in 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.000
 light depends on different concentrations 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.890
 melamine their every iris at the same time 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.570
 in the iris of some people 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 no melanin is generally called 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 the body in such cases, light can 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.840
 get into the eye and reflect the internal 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.759
 blood vessel and when the light goes out 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.390
 from the eye the iris acquires 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.780
 pink color is a similar process to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.790
 photos cause red-eye 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 in many small cameras 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.280
 flash lens located close friend 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.560
 from friend 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.540
 the light from the flash passes into the eye 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.270
 repelled by the retina reflected 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 straight cameras 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.620
 so red eyes on photos 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.800
 are a reflection of being in the eyes 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.110
 blood vessels other than rainbow color 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.570
 eye shells consist of a complex pattern 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.330
 dimples and shapes each one 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.020
 unique in its own way there are differences in 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.360
 childbirth 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.640
 identical twins and even one and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.290
 the same person so today is science 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 uses this fact to create 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.820
 identification of a person's identity technology 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 scientists believe that one day we can 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.470
 use her shopping chooses 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.720
 money from an ATM and even travel 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.080
 imagine just one megane 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.080
 eyes
