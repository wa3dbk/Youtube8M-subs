so what we're doing here is planting

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
so what we're doing here is planting
walnut<00:00:10.200> guilt<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.830> we've<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.760> these

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
walnut guilt and we've got these

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.990 
walnut guilt and we've got these
Carpathian<00:00:12.930> walnuts<00:00:13.530> which<00:00:14.340> are<00:00:14.580> this

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Carpathian walnuts which are this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.300 
Carpathian walnuts which are this
particular<00:00:15.330> ones<00:00:15.930> are<00:00:16.139> Hardy<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.770> least<00:00:17.010> 30

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
particular ones are Hardy to at least 30

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.990 
particular ones are Hardy to at least 30
below<00:00:17.700> zero<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.510> we're<00:00:19.260> brought<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:20.000> seed

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
below zero and we're brought as seed

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:43.569 
below zero and we're brought as seed
from<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.750> Carpathian<00:00:22.320> mountain<00:00:22.619> Sam<00:00:22.770> :

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.309 

this<00:00:44.579> trees<00:00:44.819> had<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.030> hard<00:00:45.269> go<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.019> giving

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319 
this trees had a hard go so we're giving

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.000 
this trees had a hard go so we're giving
a<00:00:46.409> little<00:00:46.620> love<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.219> planting<00:00:48.179> some

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
a little love by planting some

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.729 
a little love by planting some
nitrogen-fixing<00:00:50.010> plants<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.879> some

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
nitrogen-fixing plants and some

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.090 
nitrogen-fixing plants and some
insectary<00:00:52.739> plants<00:00:53.149> some<00:00:54.289> herbs<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> some

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
insectary plants some herbs and some

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.739 
insectary plants some herbs and some
barrier<00:00:56.550> plants<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:57.179> they've<00:00:57.300> dug<00:00:57.479> a<00:00:57.510> ditch

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
barrier plants so they've dug a ditch

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.329 
barrier plants so they've dug a ditch
around<00:00:57.989> they're<00:00:58.350> planning<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> few<00:00:59.039> plant

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
around they're planning a few plant

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.430 
around they're planning a few plant
plenty<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.909> few<00:01:00.539> plants<00:01:00.749> around<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.350> they're

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
plenty of few plants around and they're

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
plenty of few plants around and they're
gonna<00:01:01.530> plant<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:01.920> comfrey<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.269> ring

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

gonna plant some comfrey in a ring
around<00:01:03.749> this<00:01:04.320> plant<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.549> they'll<00:01:05.700> sheet

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
around this plant and then they'll sheet

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.360 
around this plant and then they'll sheet
mulch<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.780> area<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> suppress<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.890> existing

mulch to area to suppress the existing

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.250 
mulch to area to suppress the existing
grasses<00:01:08.970> they'll<00:01:09.630> add<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:09.990> manure

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
grasses they'll add some manure

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630

composting<00:01:12.330> actions<00:01:12.780> bring<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> ground

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
composting actions bring down the ground

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.700 
composting actions bring down the ground
and<00:01:14.370> they'll<00:01:14.970> add<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.540> organic<00:01:16.200> matter<00:01:16.410> like

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and they'll add some organic matter like

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.220 
and they'll add some organic matter like

and in in exchange the nitrogen the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.290 
and in in exchange the nitrogen the
bacteria<00:02:04.140> receives<00:02:04.740> sugars<00:02:05.520> from<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.940> plant

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and this is a form of Scotch broom it's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.110 
and this is a form of Scotch broom it's
actually<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.370> sterile<00:02:11.370> pollen<00:02:11.760> sterile

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
actually a sterile pollen sterile

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
actually a sterile pollen sterile
variety<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.750> does<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.080> receive<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.280> it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
variety so it does not receive so it's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.900 
variety so it does not receive so it's
not<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.580> real<00:02:14.790> pest<00:02:15.060> at<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.350> will<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.460> think

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
not a real pest at all and will I think

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.470 
not a real pest at all and will I think
we've<00:02:18.060> got

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
we've got

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600 
we've got

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
kind of matting rhizomatous root system

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.600 
kind of matting rhizomatous root system
which<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.409> really<00:02:29.620> competitive<00:02:30.129> with<00:02:30.519> other
