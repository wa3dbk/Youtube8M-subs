novice with computers at the moment
you've<00:00:19.619> probably<00:00:19.800> wondered<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.340> more

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
you've probably wondered how more

start<00:00:22.650> being<00:00:22.920> productive<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.519> applications

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
start being productive with applications

and an aptitude for computers can be

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
and an aptitude for computers can be
significant<00:00:28.500> contributors<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.730> season

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
significant contributors but what season

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
significant contributors but what season
computer<00:00:30.420> users<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.650> most

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
computer users know is that most

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
computer users know is that most
applications<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.669> basic<00:00:33.030> things<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.360> common

applications have basic things in common
and<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.380> where<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> look<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and they know where to look for the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.290 
and they know where to look for the
commands<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:35.670> allow<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> perform

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
commands that will allow them to perform

commands that will allow them to perform
the<00:00:36.600> tasks<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.079> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> accomplish<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the tasks they want to accomplish so in

the tasks they want to accomplish so in
this<00:00:38.700> video<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.450> over<00:00:39.600> five

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this video I want to go over five

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
this video I want to go over five
features<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.410> appear<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> work<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
features that appear in and work the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000 
features that appear in and work the
same<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> nearly<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.300> applications<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
same in nearly all applications the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
same in nearly all applications the
first<00:00:44.190> common<00:00:44.489> feature<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.210> file<00:00:45.450> menu

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
first common feature is the file menu

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
first common feature is the file menu
here<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.649> screenshots<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> file

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here are some screenshots of the file

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.700 
here are some screenshots of the file
menu<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.850> several<00:00:48.239> different<00:00:48.480> applications

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
menu from several different applications

menu from several different applications
just<00:00:49.710> about<00:00:49.860> every<00:00:50.100> application<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> file

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just about every application has a file

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670 
just about every application has a file
menu<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> usually<00:00:51.809> contains<00:00:52.320> commands

going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.360> showing<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.110> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
going to be showing you are not just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.960 
going to be showing you are not just
common<00:01:25.560> across<00:01:25.890> applications<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.939> also

there are differences to be aware of for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
there are differences to be aware of for
example<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.079> Windows<00:01:37.439> applications<00:01:38.009> you'll

example in Windows applications you'll

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
example in Windows applications you'll
usually<00:01:38.909> also<00:01:39.090> find<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> exit<00:01:40.049> command<00:01:40.259> under
