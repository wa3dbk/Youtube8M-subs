I<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> video<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.810> center<00:00:19.140> so

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I get the video up here at the center so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.509 
I get the video up here at the center so
i<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.529> drive<00:00:21.380> all<00:00:22.380> right<00:00:25.880> ok<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.710> had

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
i can drive all right ok so I I had

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.310 
i can drive all right ok so I I had
actually<00:00:29.910> thought<00:00:29.939> I'd<00:00:30.630> figured<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.109> most

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
actually thought I'd figured out most

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.410 
actually thought I'd figured out most
technically<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> wanted<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
technically of how I wanted to do this a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.060 
technically of how I wanted to do this a
little<00:00:33.989> over<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> year<00:00:34.290> ago<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.890> were

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
little over a year ago when we were

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.470 
little over a year ago when we were
talking<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.370> doing<00:00:35.730> something<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> wii

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
talking about doing something on the wii

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.790 
talking about doing something on the wii
I'm<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> set<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:39.899> ahead<00:00:40.140> if

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
I'm but when I set out to to go ahead if

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
I'm but when I set out to to go ahead if
this<00:00:41.010> went<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.370> fairly<00:00:41.940> smoothly<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this went really fairly smoothly and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
this went really fairly smoothly and
here<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> mega

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
here we have really all of the mega

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
here we have really all of the mega
textured<00:00:45.329> goodness<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.960> we're<00:00:46.079> used<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
textured goodness that we're used to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.130 
textured goodness that we're used to
enrage<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.820> many<00:00:48.030> ways<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
enrage and in many ways this is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
enrage and in many ways this is
incredibly<00:00:49.860> cool<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.579> iPad<00:00:51.000> where<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
incredibly cool on an iPad where the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
incredibly cool on an iPad where the
touch<00:00:52.140> moved<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.920> around<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.399> looking<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
touch moved it around and looking at it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
touch moved it around and looking at it
I<00:00:54.180> did<00:00:54.690> some<00:00:54.870> fairly<00:00:55.050> clever<00:00:55.379> things<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I did some fairly clever things to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
I did some fairly clever things to
approximate<00:00:56.579> sub-pixel<00:00:57.210> precision<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
approximate sub-pixel precision on the
movement<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.789> visceral<00:00:59.789> feel<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.329> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
movement and the visceral feel of just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.170 
movement and the visceral feel of just
kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> dragging<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> thing<00:01:01.949> around<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
kind of dragging the thing around I is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.770 
kind of dragging the thing around I is
very<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:04.019> neat<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.939> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> running<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> an

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
very very neat and this is running on an

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
what how but then I get to turn it over

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.819 
what how but then I get to turn it over
to<00:02:00.420> other<00:02:00.540> people<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.140> ahead<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.469> through

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.119 
turning it into a full-fledged game but
there's<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.659> little<00:02:06.810> demo<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.560> which<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.009> was

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
there's my little demo there which I was

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:18.830 
there's my little demo there which I was
kind<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> crowd

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800 

and<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.159> imagine<00:02:21.299> things<00:02:22.299> like<00:02:22.569> this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and so you can imagine things like this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.530 
and so you can imagine things like this
going<00:02:23.109> I<00:02:23.560> look<00:02:24.519> towards<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.849> industry<00:02:25.390> in

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
going I look towards the industry in

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.750 
going I look towards the industry in
future<00:02:25.930> years<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.890> idea<00:02:27.219> that<00:02:27.280> yeah<00:02:27.549> I<00:02:27.579> just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
future years the idea that yeah I just

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.250 
future years the idea that yeah I just
pulled<00:02:28.180> out<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.299> my<00:02:28.450> pocket<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.900> machine

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
pulled out of my pocket the machine

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
pulled out of my pocket the machine
there<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.730> know<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.879> could<00:02:31.090> kill

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
there that you know I could kill

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.420 
there that you know I could kill
anything<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.409> previous<00:02:32.650> generation

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
anything on a previous generation

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
anything on a previous generation
console<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.180> an<00:02:34.390> Xbox<00:02:34.629> or<00:02:35.109> I<00:02:35.170> am<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:35.950> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
console like an Xbox or I am you know a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.369 
console like an Xbox or I am you know a
ps2<00:02:36.579> or<00:02:36.609> something<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.780> hardware<00:02:38.140> that's

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
ps2 or something on the hardware that's

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.470 
ps2 or something on the hardware that's
there<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:38.799> not<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.250> powerful<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> current

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
there it's not as powerful as a current

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.869 
there it's not as powerful as a current
generation<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.409> it's<00:02:41.709> not<00:02:41.890> all<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.489> far<00:02:42.849> off

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
generation but it's not all that far off

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.789 
generation but it's not all that far off
where<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:44.109> basically<00:02:44.200> looking<00:02:44.439> at

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
where you're basically looking at

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:45.929 
where you're basically looking at
something<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.310> vertex<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.879> fragment

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
something with vertex and fragment

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.379 
something with vertex and fragment
shaders<00:02:46.689> 512<00:02:47.530> megabytes<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.129> memory<00:02:48.189> I<00:02:48.790> pretty

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.110 
shaders 512 megabytes of memory I pretty
good<00:02:49.629> storage<00:02:49.930> on<00:02:50.290> there<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:51.879> know<00:02:51.970> you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
good storage on there and you know you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640 
good storage on there and you know you
can<00:02:52.150> imagine<00:02:52.450> coming<00:02:52.900> up<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.139> playing<00:02:53.409> some

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
can imagine coming up and playing some

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.619 
can imagine coming up and playing some
things<00:02:53.920> plugging<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.970> big<00:02:55.120> screen<00:02:55.420> or

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
things plugging in on the big screen or

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.839 
things plugging in on the big screen or
on<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.870> small<00:02:56.139> screen<00:02:56.379> on<00:02:56.650> there<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.280> still

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
on the small screen on there it still

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.729 
on the small screen on there it still
lacks<00:02:58.090> tactile<00:02:58.750> feedback<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> bunch<00:02:59.680> of
