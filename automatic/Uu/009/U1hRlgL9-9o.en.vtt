00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.380
 hello and welcome to the star 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.070
 the tv - today we discuss the action 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.060
 from the power parallelogram I have now 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.460
 here already a box drawn where 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.910
 two persons person 1 is there rather 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.730
 paradise carlo try to crate 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.830
 move 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.720
 this creates a force in the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.160
 a point of accesses so I have now 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.870
 times the effect line of daniel and 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.110
 the change of carlo registered 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.360
 what is an axiom of an action? 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.420
 is actually a law that on the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.890
 experience is not based on which 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 can be simplified or not 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.699
 other laws can be explained so 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.090
 that action from the forces parallelogram 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.969
 now states that if we have two powers 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.960
 have the attack in one point 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.399
 then so can a single power he 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.790
 a resulting generate the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.960
 likewise in the point attacks the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.500
 teach size and direction first 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.350
 diagonal of both forces 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 spanned parallelogram sr 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.470
 a lot of information at once 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.360
 we watch us again in detail at 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.040
 so there daniel a little bit smaller 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 biceps offers so the carlower is the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.560
 by virtue of the powerful one that produces something 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.780
 smaller than that of kahlo now show me 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.020
 times a force parallelogram that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.870
 means the effect line of carlo 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 tragic to the endpoint of the power of 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.550
 daniel 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.050
 So that's the effect sienna of carlo 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.170
 and the effect line of daniel wear 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.610
 I reach the end of carlos power 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 and we see we already have one here 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.510
 type parallelogram generated and the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.070
 Action now states that we have one 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.940
 the resulting ones have turned out to be 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.860
 diagonal by both forces 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.490
 spanned forces parallelogram it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.500
 that means that here 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.590
 my result is static 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.780
 equivalent or equivalent to the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 the other two I can now so to speak 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.110
 omit these two forces and only 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.730
 he attack that one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.840
 resulting and that would be the same 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.160
 like when i use these two forces fc and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.510
 fdp have now can for one 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.150
 Calculation of my results then 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.490
 done in the situation plan or even 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.740
 in a so-called power plan, then 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.440
 the location plan only shows the current situation 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.950
 displayed in the forces plan we know yes 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.810
 forces are vectors that means when 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.870
 I am now in my room in my life 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.400
 I just want to wear it now 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 now string together an authoritative 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.630
 all known powers what is known 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.120
 fc is known and we fdp with fd to was 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.440
 that one point here so now 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.220
 I make fdp look that first 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.080
 about the angle 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.670
 there must of course be the same that sfd 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.380
 and be authoritative for others from here 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.960
 I now wear my point my strength 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 fc 1 So take the force fc and 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.150
 move here in this point fc 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.280
 the important thing is that you are important 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.390
 now a drawing solution would be that 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.900
 must be exactly as long as that now 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 and that must be just as long as that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 book sorry that's my fc now 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.080
 My endpoint, so to speak, I can now 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.780
 represent this endpoint 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.640
 So either I'll get that from 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.450
 here after here in the i about fd and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.530
 or I'm wearing mine 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.620
 resulting in a knife now the length 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.000
 from my geo 3 or ruler calculator it 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.390
 back to the scale and we see 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.830
 this force to the same size as the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.620
 should be about when i do that 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.300
 significantly drawn 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.980
 It is still important that you either 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.690
 can do the calculation in the situation plan 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.690
 or in power plan 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.470
 So now see again that the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.790
 The choice of first power is irrelevant 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.740
 So now whether I'm from now 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.540
 Starting point start with rd or with fc 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.320
 I wear this again starts with 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.290
 fc 1 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.150
 So I take the force Fc wear it 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
 that starting point one then we are yes 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.790
 I have to draw approximately exactly now 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.160
 this is now fcx other is from 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.100
 this provisional endpoint is now wearing 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.250
 still my effect my strength fd on 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.290
 heed the effect line and that would be 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.140
 fd and you do not care if i use fdp or 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.060
 I always start with fcb 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.080
 the same endpoint but this one 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.460
 endpoint I can as I said 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.810
 either reach over the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.680
 stringing together these r vectors 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.720
 these forces or mine 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.020
 resulting now i can of course 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.760
 the angles here also determine if 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.750
 that is of interest but that should be 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.460
 get an impression of it now 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.200
 what ever this action from 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.200
 forces parallelogram is thank you
