00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.900
 and I'm with a new video tutorial that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.610
 maybe you like a good invention 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.219
 I could say invention, no, you can not 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.310
 say invention I would say rather well a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.800
 method of lighting in a temple or in 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.369
 a cavern whatever in the typical 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.609
 fire that makes and illuminates the room in 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.039
 plan so mysterious roll an image 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.780
 is worth more than a thousand words that is to say 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.910
 to enter here inside we are not going to cover and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 imagine that you are here on a map of 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.129
 events 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.719
 but this environmental sound has 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.460
 stayed mother fucking game that dark 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.929
 that you are good this lever does not have 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.800
 that being here, you can not put 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.920
 some hook or some pressure plate and 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.920
 pass this 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.129
 and the room lights up with fire and roll 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.590
 temple roll maya temple scroll 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.059
 good secret let's go again and here 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.059
 we have our chest box 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.340
 I am here to explain how it is done 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.740
 this so if you have not seen other 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.479
 tutorials of my channel for my past 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.310
 perfectly to see them well then 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.630
 let's go first to see the circuit 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.820
 resistón in what consists the circuit of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.399
 remains good for the lever that is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.590
 down here if we give it then we 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.810
 send a reston signal over here 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.240
 up and we have these two repeaters 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.039
 two each had three tics tics forgiveness 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.720
 with four I shout to give more 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.720
 mystery in planting new book 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.100
 then it would come up here pop and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.229
 would reactivate this later would continue by 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.960
 here pop would activate this guy over here 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.119
 and it would activate this and come here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.679
 and to finish or activate these 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.869
 last two but I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.310
 how to do this without all these 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.310
 circuits and without rolls of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.540
 we need a stone notice here very 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.060
 well and now let's put a 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.580
 dispenser a dispenser let's say to 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 this height leaving a block through 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.690
 they are worth inside the dispenser 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.850
 to put a flint and we will need 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 a sticky piston 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.200
 at this height that according to you get it 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.810
 well then we put now a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.350
 stone brick that a torch of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.950
 rest 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.190
 and let's say that around here would come 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.030
 the circuit but good with a lever 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.760
 It is useful too 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.330
 let's see, let's take the stern 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 very well perfect that makes this good 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 because the lever deactivates the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.330
 torch with which makes the piston 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.160
 replicate itself that is to say apart 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.780
 the stone I have seen other videos 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.030
 fixing on the idea not taking some 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.710
 some ideas from here and for 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.170
 there 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.110
 then you can put on 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.370
 make temple like 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.230
 It is obviously your adventure map 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 but I have taught you what is coming 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:14.000
 being this idea of ​​making a temple like that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.440
 mystical and spooky and magical so 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.900
 as I liked it, let's see it 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.300
 last time 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.650
 burning 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.650
 no no 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.690
 now diamond inside and I hope it continues 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.690
 ahead 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.819
 if you liked the video give me 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.989
 like to subscribe to my channel for more 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.970
 bullshit and video tutorials on twitter and 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.269
 on facebook and we 'll see you in a next 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.269
 video
