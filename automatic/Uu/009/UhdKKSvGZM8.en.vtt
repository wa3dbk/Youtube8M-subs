right now is 61 with sixty-five percent
humidity<00:01:00.140> don't<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.860> new

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
humidity don't really do have to get new

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.230 
humidity don't really do have to get new
matches<00:01:05.840> like<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.900 

can<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.330> see<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:12.310> we'll<00:01:13.310> start<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:15.910> now

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
can you see that we'll start this now

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.640 
can you see that we'll start this now
the<00:01:16.970> last<00:01:17.240> time<00:01:17.540> when<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.870> did<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.290> with<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the last time when I did this with the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.460 
the last time when I did this with the
one<00:01:18.830> fluid<00:01:19.130> ounce<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:20.660> brought<00:01:20.900> two<00:01:21.140> cups<00:01:21.380> of

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
one fluid ounce it brought two cups of

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.300 
one fluid ounce it brought two cups of
water<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.979> full<00:01:22.310> boil<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:23.290> 8<00:01:24.290> minutes<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.740> 56

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
water to a full boil in 8 minutes and 56

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.219 
water to a full boil in 8 minutes and 56
seconds<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:27.160> how<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.220> run<00:01:28.550> out<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.970> 17<00:01:29.869> minutes

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
seconds and how to run out of 17 minutes

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.300 
seconds and how to run out of 17 minutes
and<00:01:30.380> 50<00:01:30.830> seconds<00:01:31.520> which<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:33.010> little<00:01:34.010> bit<00:01:34.130> too

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
and 50 seconds which is a little bit too

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.150 
and 50 seconds which is a little bit too
long<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:34.850> let's<00:01:35.000> see<00:01:35.410> what<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:36.590> does<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.130> a

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
long so let's see what this does with a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:02:00.550 
long so let's see what this does with a
half<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.760> flu<00:01:37.970> announced

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:09.290 

there<00:02:01.159> we<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.700> 10

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.420 

211<00:02:10.530> sounds<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.620> it's<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:11.980> about<00:02:12.130> ready<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
211 sounds like it's just about ready to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.330 
211 sounds like it's just about ready to
run<00:02:12.730> out<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:17.520> 12<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.850> like<00:02:19.840> 10<00:02:20.200> minutes<00:02:20.680> 11

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
run out to 12 at like 10 minutes 11

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:32.970 
run out to 12 at like 10 minutes 11
seconds<00:02:25.890> 10<00:02:26.890> minutes<00:02:27.220> 11<00:02:27.610> seconds

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.360 

and<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.989> kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.590> looks<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.159> is<00:02:36.340> just

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and it kind of looks like this is just

00:02:36.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
and it kind of looks like this is just
about<00:02:36.849> ready<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.180> run<00:02:37.959> out

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:13.220 

going

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.830 

going

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:30.360 

and<00:03:21.319> gone<00:03:21.860> at<00:03:22.220> 11<00:03:23.120> minutes<00:03:23.620> 15<00:03:24.620> seconds

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.390 

so<00:03:31.599> that<00:03:32.599> was<00:03:32.719> a<00:03:32.750> retest<00:03:33.260> where<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:33.829> took<00:03:34.069> two

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
so that was a retest where I took two

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.440 
so that was a retest where I took two
cups<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:34.730> water<00:03:35.000> starting<00:03:35.450> at<00:03:35.569> 59<00:03:36.019> degrees<00:03:36.049> and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
cups of water starting at 59 degrees and

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.940 
cups of water starting at 59 degrees and
this<00:03:38.450> time<00:03:38.659> when<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.870> put<00:03:39.049> it<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.409> venom<00:03:39.739> so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
this time when I put it on the venom so

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.759 
this time when I put it on the venom so
if<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.250> only<00:03:40.430> had<00:03:40.760> one<00:03:41.269> one<00:03:41.900> half<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.379> fluid

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
if I only had one one half of fluid

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.729 
if I only had one one half of fluid
ounce<00:03:42.920> about<00:03:43.219> 15<00:03:43.670> milliliters<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.739> denatured

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
ounce about 15 milliliters of denatured

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.729 
ounce about 15 milliliters of denatured
alcohol<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:48.019> brought<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.349> two<00:03:48.500> cups

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
alcohol in here it brought to two cups

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.679 
alcohol in here it brought to two cups
of<00:03:48.859> water<00:03:49.069> to<00:03:49.129> boil<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:49.790> 10<00:03:50.000> minutes<00:03:50.209> 11

of water to boil in 10 minutes 11

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.440 
of water to boil in 10 minutes 11
seconds<00:03:51.109> in<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.439> last<00:03:51.650> test<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.299> 8

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
seconds in the last test it was 8

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.280 
seconds in the last test it was 8
minutes<00:03:53.629> and<00:03:53.900> 56<00:03:54.500> seconds<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.959> run<00:03:56.959> out<00:03:57.139> on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
minutes and 56 seconds and run out on

minutes and 56 seconds and run out on
the<00:03:57.409> last<00:03:57.590> test<00:03:57.950> using<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.519> fluid<00:03:58.939> ounce<00:03:59.090> was<00:03:59.450> 17

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
the last test using a fluid ounce was 17

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.920 
the last test using a fluid ounce was 17
minutes<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.530> 50<00:04:00.829> seconds<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:02.299> time<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.750> ran

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
minutes and 50 seconds this time it ran

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.270 
minutes and 50 seconds this time it ran
out<00:04:03.139> in<00:04:03.639> 11<00:04:04.639> minutes<00:04:04.819> 15<00:04:05.389> seconds<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.010> took

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
out in 11 minutes 15 seconds so it took

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.610 
out in 11 minutes 15 seconds so it took
longer<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.700> heat<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.510> water<00:04:08.689> and<00:04:08.959> it

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
longer to heat up the water and it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.729 
longer to heat up the water and it
didn't<00:04:09.859> run<00:04:10.040> quite<00:04:10.489> as<00:04:10.639> long<00:04:10.849> just<00:04:11.560> barely<00:04:12.560> a

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
didn't run quite as long just barely a

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.920 
didn't run quite as long just barely a
minute<00:04:12.950> passed<00:04:13.280> boiling<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.299> make<00:04:14.599> you<00:04:14.720> safe

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
minute passed boiling to make you safe

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
too much in this and waste it because

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.420
