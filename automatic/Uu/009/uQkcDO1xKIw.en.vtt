00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.450
 Start by combining in a large bowl 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.000

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.740

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.180
 so you get something like that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.210
 in a mold to expose cap that 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.470
 paper aisles and empty the mixture 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.470

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 we go 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.920
 one 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.629

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.209
 and we make another cup puree 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.319
 to the latter we add 2 tablespoons 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.319
 of splenda granulated 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.090
