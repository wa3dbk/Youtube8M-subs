00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.470
 they return the trainings for the union 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.600
 sports the palms after this 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.039
 Christmas break enough excitement 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.769
 part of the yellow fans with the 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.599
 return of jonathan viera and how not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.660
 illusions more than renewed for this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.240
 2015 that he had won a week 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 action to the team and there we are again 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 to continue dreaming of the challenge of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 upgrade if it brings a great column 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 It would be perfect anymore but I think with 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 see, we already have if the truth that I 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.680
 I studied outside but I came here with desire 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.230
 because the whole island is motivated with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.840
 the team and come on I'm one of those who 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.840
 they think that if a better striker 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.699
 We have the truth and I was a little bit 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.120
 pending to start training the 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.649
 players that is more jail to columns 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.000
 if you can come and if not then with this 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.129
 I'm sure that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.409
 we went up to first division had was of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.780
 see it but there's one too to see how 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.780
 I was coming for a month and without playing 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 always hard francisco matches in a row 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.649
 I bring little squares 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.479
 I think it suits them to see 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.509
 now it is always an incentive 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.270
 go back to see the match where 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.100
 after playing with the team saw 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 adapt by combining with top 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.810
 araujo in the absence of momo always with 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.459
 efficient let me team reinforce it not 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.409
 I think but if you come from Columbia, which is 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.080
 what is being talked about would be a 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.369
 man up fast different man yo 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.250
 I want my children to see the way 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.240
 first 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.610
 until it does not get that is not 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.310
 quiet this year will be what will enjoy it and 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.940
 we will enjoy it all 2015 is our 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.890
 14 year forget it suits us 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.260
 bad to see if we learn from the bad that does not 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.940
 I know if something is learned but 15 is 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 ours one year ago on the 15th 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.180
 is that 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.150
 to me 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.770
 i 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 I
