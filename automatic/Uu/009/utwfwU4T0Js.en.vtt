in Mac I wear an NW 55 so like I'm dark
chocolate<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.359> I<00:02:33.109> think<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.769> wig<00:02:33.950> looks

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
chocolate and I think the wig looks

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.390 
chocolate and I think the wig looks
really<00:02:34.670> pretty<00:02:34.880> um<00:02:35.680> otherwise<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.160> cat

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
really pretty um otherwise the cat

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.309 
really pretty um otherwise the cat
construction<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> wig<00:02:38.329> is<00:02:38.540> number<00:02:39.019> three

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
construction of the wig is number three

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.349 
construction of the wig is number three
which<00:02:39.530> basically<00:02:39.889> means<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.970> glueless

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
which basically means it's a glueless

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.120 
which basically means it's a glueless
cap<00:02:41.600> construction<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.560> won't<00:02:42.739> need<00:02:42.859> any

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
cap construction so you won't need any

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.840 
cap construction so you won't need any
tape<00:02:43.400> or<00:02:43.700> glue<00:02:43.730> or<00:02:44.650> sew<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.769> any<00:02:45.920> bands<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.700> make

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
tape or glue or sew in any bands to make

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.410 
tape or glue or sew in any bands to make
