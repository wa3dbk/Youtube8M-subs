ctrl a and delete all of these files and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.160 
ctrl a and delete all of these files and
there's<00:00:42.360> gonna<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:42.989> because

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
there's gonna be a lot of them because

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.420 
there's gonna be a lot of them because
they're<00:00:43.379> temporary<00:00:43.739> files<00:00:43.950> from<00:00:44.219> all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
they're temporary files from all

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
they're temporary files from all
applications<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.270> all<00:00:45.360> games<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
applications and all games that use that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500 
applications and all games that use that
you<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.860> necessarily<00:00:47.129> need<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.390> they

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you don't necessarily need but they

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
you don't necessarily need but they
might<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.840> interfere<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.590> certain<00:00:50.160> things

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
might also interfere with certain things

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
might also interfere with certain things
and<00:00:50.760> rewriting<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> ahead

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and rewriting so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.100 
and rewriting so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:52.680> delete<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.629> after

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and delete all those and then after

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
and delete all those and then after
you're<00:00:55.230> done<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> probably

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you're done with that which is probably

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
you're done with that which is probably
the<00:00:56.640> best<00:00:56.969> thing<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the best thing you can do which you can

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.029 
the best thing you can do which you can
see<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:58.890> probably<00:00:59.449> a<00:01:00.710> huge<00:01:01.710> amount

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
see here there's probably a huge amount

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
see here there's probably a huge amount
of<00:01:02.129> stuff<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.510> there's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> few

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
of stuff there and then there's a few

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.210 
of stuff there and then there's a few
things<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> might<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:04.979> able<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
things that you might not be able to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
things that you might not be able to
delete<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.420> being<00:01:06.689> shared<00:01:06.930> after

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
delete because it's being shared after

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.870 
delete because it's being shared after
you<00:01:07.619> reboot<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.010> computer<00:01:08.159> whatever<00:01:08.640> you'll

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you reboot your computer whatever you'll

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.080 
you reboot your computer whatever you'll
be<00:01:09.000> able<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> delete<00:01:09.420> those<00:01:09.659> two<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
be able to delete those two but like I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
be able to delete those two but like I
said<00:01:12.270> there's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.510> huge<00:01:12.840> amount<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> stuff

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
said there's a huge amount of stuff

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
said there's a huge amount of stuff
there<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.700> rid<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.939> clean<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.630> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
there so get rid of that clean up your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
there so get rid of that clean up your
hard<00:01:16.049> drive<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.009> you'll

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hard drive a little bit and then you'll

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
hard drive a little bit and then you'll
be<00:01:17.549> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.000> run<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> game<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.680> should

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
be able to run the game and it should

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.820 
be able to run the game and it should
rewrite<00:01:20.930> another<00:01:21.930> thing<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
rewrite another thing that you can do is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
rewrite another thing that you can do is
reinstall<00:01:25.830> World<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> Warcraft<00:01:26.850> after<00:01:27.570> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
reinstall World of Warcraft after that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350 
reinstall World of Warcraft after that
and<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.040> definitely<00:01:29.159> help<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:30.090> fact

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and that will definitely help in fact

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
and that will definitely help in fact
that<00:01:30.570> might<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> necessary<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:33.650> then<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that might be necessary and then get a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
that might be necessary and then get a
registry<00:01:35.369> cleaner<00:01:35.720> they're<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
registry cleaner they're not that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
registry cleaner they're not that
they're<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.619> free<00:01:38.100> well<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.549> least<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> good

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
they're not free well at least the good

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.580 
they're not free well at least the good
ones<00:01:39.119> aren't<00:01:39.450> usually<00:01:39.570> free<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> don't<00:01:40.409> know

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
ones aren't usually free I don't know

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.200 
ones aren't usually free I don't know
maybe<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> something<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> free

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
maybe you know of something that is free

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.289 
maybe you know of something that is free
but<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> registry<00:01:43.409> cleaner<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:44.520> help<00:01:44.729> make

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but a registry cleaner could help make

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179 
but a registry cleaner could help make
sure<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.290> don't<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.040> one

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
sure that you don't have more than one

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
sure that you don't have more than one
hantavirus<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:48.180> those<00:01:48.420> could<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> when

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
hantavirus because those could it when

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
hantavirus because those could it when
they're<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.009> scans<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.759> could<00:01:50.909> interfere
