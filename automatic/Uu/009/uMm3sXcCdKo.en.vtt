00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi this one tailors and i want 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.599
 raise such a question why the furniture 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.330
 paints so kind of like it's made of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.599
 the tree on it will not say that it is made 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 From the tree of this, in principle, not visible 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.710
 Why, then, in general, in principle, for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 making furniture use wood 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 Now if you look at this facade 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.789
 then it is quite difficult to determine 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.820
 that it is made of wood made of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820
 wood 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.810
 Why is this happening well firstly? 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.790
 This is achieved and as I say already 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.700
 what scary stuff 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.920
 there is such a thing as enamel and this 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.660
 opaque trimming which covers 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 tree and hides its drawing completely 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.700
 marigold rocks so that's it 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.140
 doing it gets exactly this 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.710
 the result is that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.739
 they will paint my tree and not see what it is 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.870
 the tree is actually here more degree 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.150
 this question i meet with deniz lynn 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.770
 nicknames very often hear a 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390
 why this one was not like this 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.610
 painted over it is not visible that she 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.440
 made of wood kind of like wood 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 generally gone and it is not clear what it is 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.740
 tree 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 why did it have to be made of wood 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.280
 all the furniture ruined so now here I am well 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.160
 I would like to say so in fact 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.649
 it's really hard to be in that place 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.020
 where is the other person but if 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.740
 try to ask him to stand on his 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 the place will be a little bit easier and as rights 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.179
 as if in more detail and clarifying in 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.640
 principle shows that often people 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:46.130
 who order wood furniture and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 ask and paint so basically 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.179
 even if no tree is visible to them 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.970
 it's not scary as a rule it's people 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.490
 who have already tried some first 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.009
 options ordered or bought furniture 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.170
 from a tree on it it was already visible that from 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.390
 wood as if they already tried 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 everybody knows they understand the benefits 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.930
 tree however they are looking for some other 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 interesting 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.940
 more graceful whether any other 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.940
 aspects of another just design just 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.340
 interesting in itself design and let's say 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.500
 if the woody pattern itself is not 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.960
 suited to this design that meaningful 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.260
 leaves this case the whole project 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.330
 are more subject to design and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.970
 the design itself has more 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.890
 meaning than what the project should clearly 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.110
 demonstrate that it is made of wood 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.920
 this should not be enough 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.560
 one thing that the consumer is the owner 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 this product is this furniture to wooden 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.180
 designer he understand that in principle 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.790
 is she inside anyway wooden this 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.700
 outwardly enough the main thing for him 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.320
 there was an interesting design tree leave 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.570
 why in this case yes because how 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.820
 I do not do the exterior design in principle 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.600
 understanding of what's inside you don't care 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.100
 remains 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.160
 if you have inner confidence 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.470
 what's the tree used here in 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.880
 this furniture is wood then you understand 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.430
 that this furniture is durable 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.970
 pithy she will serve you 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.230
 long reliably do you understand that in mitino 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 there is some value but something like this 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.420
 if there is any about this 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.310
 questions comments write answer 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.599

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.599
 designer thanks
