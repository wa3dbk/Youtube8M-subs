00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
how to do this makeup tutorial and I

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.680 
how to do this makeup tutorial and I
instantly<00:00:05.279> fell<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.850> love<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.480> she

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
instantly fell in love with it and she

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.350 
instantly fell in love with it and she
said<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.049> she<00:00:07.200> did<00:00:07.410> too<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.150> simple

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
to create and I think that it can be

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.009 
to create and I think that it can be
worn<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> daily<00:00:11.519> basis<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.150> also<00:00:12.330> bumped<00:00:12.750> up
