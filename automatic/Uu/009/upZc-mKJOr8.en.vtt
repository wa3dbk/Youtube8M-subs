on<00:01:56.369> his<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:56.820> two<00:01:56.969> tries<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:58.079> let's<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.380> if

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
on his first two tries so let's see if

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
on his first two tries so let's see if
we<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
we can do that and there we go and that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.069 
we can do that and there we go and that
is<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.100> closest<00:02:02.640> Minecraft<00:02:03.479> approximation

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
is the closest Minecraft approximation

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.990 
is the closest Minecraft approximation
of<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.740> happens<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.310> gets<00:02:05.490> punched<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
of what happens he gets punched in the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.830 
of what happens he gets punched in the
gut<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.259> fact<00:02:07.530> died<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
gut but we in fact died so that is the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
gut but we in fact died so that is the
pressure<00:02:10.110> plate<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.470> room<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:11.129> bite-sized

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580

Minecraft<00:02:12.060> 3<00:02:12.360> let's<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.080> how

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
Minecraft 3 let's see how

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.130 
Minecraft 3 let's see how
works<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.900> where<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.040> there<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.310> is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
works here it is where is it there it is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.450 
works here it is where is it there it is
basically<00:02:20.140> we're<00:02:20.740> never<00:02:20.860> used<00:02:21.100> up<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
basically we're never used up on the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.570 
basically we're never used up on the
pressure<00:02:21.700> plate<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:23.500> will<00:02:23.740> turn<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.340> torch

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
pressure plate it will turn this torch

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.530 
pressure plate it will turn this torch
off<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.410> will<00:02:26.590> open<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> door<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.940> then

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
off and it will open the door and then

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.810 
off and it will open the door and then
it'll<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.950> will<00:02:30.220> trigger<00:02:30.610> this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
it'll do this it will trigger this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.150 
it'll do this it will trigger this
randomizer<00:02:32.640> which<00:02:33.640> will<00:02:34.030> send<00:02:34.540> either<00:02:35.320> one<00:02:35.830> or

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
randomizer which will send either one or

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.070 
randomizer which will send either one or
two<00:02:37.650> pulses<00:02:38.650> or<00:02:38.800> not<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:39.730> or<00:02:39.850> two<00:02:39.880> pulses<00:02:40.300> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
two pulses or not one or two pulses a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.210 
two pulses or not one or two pulses a
pulse<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:42.070> one<00:02:42.490> or<00:02:42.820> two<00:02:43.300> strikes<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.070> it's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
pulse of one or two strikes and if it's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.260 
pulse of one or two strikes and if it's
one<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.620> triggers<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> randomizer<00:02:48.940> if

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
one then it triggers this randomizer if

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.840 
one then it triggers this randomizer if
it's<00:02:49.480> two<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.080> triggers<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.620> one<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.170> ah<00:02:53.850> then

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
it's two it triggers this one so ah then

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's two it triggers this one so ah then
it's<00:02:55.390> if<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:55.840> two<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.230> triggers<00:02:56.500> this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it's if it's two it triggers this

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.760 
it's if it's two it triggers this
randomizer<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.490> if<00:02:58.330> that's<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.560> goes

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
randomizer and if that's one it goes

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.220 
randomizer and if that's one it goes
here<00:03:00.160> if<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.460> two<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.790> goes<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.090> etc<00:03:01.570> so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
here if it's two it goes there etc so

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.680 
here if it's two it goes there etc so
basically<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.820> does<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.390> chooses

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
basically what this does is it chooses

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.450 
basically what this does is it chooses
randomly<00:03:04.960> between<00:03:06.000> four<00:03:07.000> different<00:03:07.270> options

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
randomly between four different options

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.150 
randomly between four different options
the<00:03:09.460> first<00:03:09.490> one<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.750> which<00:03:11.380> summons<00:03:11.770> a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
the first one is this which summons a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.700 
the first one is this which summons a
profusion<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.820> squids<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:13.990> second<00:03:14.350> one<00:03:14.500> is

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
profusion of squids the second one is

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.330 
profusion of squids the second one is
this<00:03:15.010> which<00:03:15.760> summons<00:03:16.180> two<00:03:16.750> fireworks<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
this which summons two fireworks the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.030 
this which summons two fireworks the
third<00:03:18.520> one<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.030> which<00:03:19.810> summons<00:03:20.140> Gollum

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
third one is this which summons Gollum

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
third one is this which summons Gollum
writing<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.370> slime<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.270> fourth<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.630> is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
writing a slime and the fourth one is

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660 
writing a slime and the fourth one is
this<00:03:22.930> which<00:03:23.200> suns<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:24.010> not<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.490> could<00:03:24.610> a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
this which suns the is not the could a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.610 
this which suns the is not the could a
cow<00:03:24.880> jockey<00:03:25.320> pardon<00:03:26.320> me

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
cow jockey pardon me

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.610 
cow jockey pardon me
whoops<00:03:29.580> basically<00:03:30.840> that's<00:03:31.840> how<00:03:31.960> it<00:03:32.140> works<00:03:32.380> and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
whoops basically that's how it works and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.440 
whoops basically that's how it works and
then<00:03:32.890> as<00:03:33.160> soon<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.820> step<00:03:34.000> off<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.240> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
then as soon as you step off of the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.430 
then as soon as you step off of the
pressure<00:03:34.660> plate<00:03:34.960> or<00:03:36.330> or<00:03:37.330> rather<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.810> pressure

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
pressure plate or or rather the pressure

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.190 
pressure plate or or rather the pressure
plate<00:03:38.740> stops<00:03:39.400> giving<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.030> pulse<00:03:40.270> stops<00:03:41.020> it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
plate stops giving a pulse stops it

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
plate stops giving a pulse stops it

signal this torch turns back on and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.120 
signal this torch turns back on and
kills<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:46.540> rather<00:03:46.840> not<00:03:47.080> kills<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.680> yes<00:03:47.980> it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
kills or rather not kills but yes it

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
does it a hundred times which is plenty

does it a hundred times which is plenty
a<00:04:02.940> hundred<00:04:03.940> blocks<00:04:04.210> down<00:04:04.540> work<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:07.060> will

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
a hundred blocks down work and that will

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.820 
a hundred blocks down work and that will
instantly<00:04:07.750> kill<00:04:07.960> them<00:04:08.170> because<00:04:08.290> they<00:04:08.620> fall

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
instantly kill them because they fall

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.610 
instantly kill them because they fall
into<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> void<00:04:09.300> then<00:04:10.350> whenever<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.470> get

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
into the void then whenever you get

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.990 
into the void then whenever you get
within<00:04:11.830> five<00:04:12.400> blocks<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.840> command<00:04:14.260> block

within five blocks of this command block

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.030 
within five blocks of this command block
let's<00:04:16.000> turn<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.660> off<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.140> look<00:04:17.920> at<00:04:17.980> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
let's turn it off and look at the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.699 
let's turn it off and look at the
command<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.850> will<00:04:18.910> kill<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.540> which<00:04:20.260> because

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
command it will kill you which because
