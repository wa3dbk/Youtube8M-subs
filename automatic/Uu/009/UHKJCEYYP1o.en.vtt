 miss them on Russian territory 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.510
 federation due to the fact that they do not wish 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.900
 continue the meaningless war which 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.120

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.769
 if the militia withdrew to the side 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.350

 my subordinates 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.640

 to Ukraine but to return to the service 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.230
 planning not all many officers 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.610
 suspect that the death of their brigade was 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.160
 scheduled in advance 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.820
 were dropped into ammunition 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.360
 artillery who do not fit under 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.310
 our system 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.120
 armament and the whole length cannot 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.520
 2 of 3 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.110
 shoot ammunition d 20 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.110
 once we helped don't know 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.650
 maybe it could be another 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.600
 option which scared me what is it 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.280
 everything special was done how everything was on 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.140
 in fact it just forgot about them 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.880
 the existence of borderline fighters 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.220
 hope to find out after returning home 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.670
 questions without answers they are still very 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.200
 lot
