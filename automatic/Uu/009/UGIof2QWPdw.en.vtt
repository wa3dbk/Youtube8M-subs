00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
from that though it's almost impossible

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.030 
from that though it's almost impossible
to<00:00:32.820> set<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> two<00:00:33.300> Z's<00:00:33.510> apart<00:00:33.989> however<00:00:34.800> if

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to set the two Z's apart however if

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
to set the two Z's apart however if
you'll<00:00:35.219> dig<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.640> deeper<00:00:35.670> you'll<00:00:36.390> quickly

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you'll dig a bit deeper you'll quickly

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.389 
you'll dig a bit deeper you'll quickly
find<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.380> aspects<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.010> actually

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
find out that some aspects have actually

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
find out that some aspects have actually
changed<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:39.300> starters<00:00:39.719> you'll<00:00:39.899> notice<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379

the front face as well below the screen
and<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.170> cuts<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.649> hide

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and that's because this cuts now hide

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
and that's because this cuts now hide
