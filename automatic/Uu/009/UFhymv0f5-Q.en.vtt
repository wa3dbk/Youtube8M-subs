00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.400
 an event was held every four years 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.960
 sports that keeps everyone 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.520
 on edge for at least a month and 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.029
 also of course to the videos 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.029
 players 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.810
 and to review the history of the 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 worldwide in video games I bring you 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.730
 this series of video games of the world 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.650
 we are in 1990 and see what players 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.970
 Myths of the Italian team come out 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 to promote videogames 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.580
 my mother what naturalness is of 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.590
 lentini as much as his game in the field 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.790
 and especially this look as well as that of the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 neighborhood movie 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.430
 It makes me feel very appropriate 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.100
 but if it's the mythical legend of the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.420
 Italian team Inter coach 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.370
 from Manchester City and now the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.900
 galatasaray that good has not had much 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.479
 success as a coach but good is a 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.739
 mythical uncle not ok and look at the next 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:02.379
 porterazo then active doctor not me 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.360
 forgive that one because it is not lost nor 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.770
 a program because they see it guiding 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 because I do not think with the soil of a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.050
 footballer you could pay what he spent 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.540
 the damn game guide in rows 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.970
 we are already in sega megadrive and in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 italy-90 game of good here is the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.940
 selection of equipment that we make in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 cursor fair so primitive that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.210
 elegies based on tube skills 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.010
 nationality then you choose the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.900
 players to place them in a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.520
 training that was already predetermined and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.980
 the raffle was done with teams like 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.740
 morocco was east germany hole that 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.030
 Algeria is taken to Algeria 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.790
 qualified for the italy world cup 90 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.550
 because if the game is more mythical than 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 good because in some packs there was 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.380
 came the console will be called mega drive 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.930
 with Monaco gp columns e italia 90 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 so that's why a lot of people have it 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 as a great memory of the very good 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.910
 I remember italy 90 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.180
 Although the logo to use is not a game 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.470
 that we say is so good because what 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 The only thing you can play is to play the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.790
 world or play the world cup basically 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.470
 in could play the world well not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.900
 you can play world wrong or just 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.570
 you can try to shoot and put all the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.490
 Goals you can to your friends and show off 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.430
 in front of then at the school in haiti 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.990
 won the world cup italy 90 that good 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.760
 I am that that is the error I was a 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.350
 little there were no faults therefore if 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.980
 lost the ball kicked to the song and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.030
 add thing 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.180
 nothing happens and in the end the trick was 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.090
 in getting to make plays from above 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.220
 that is, there was a way of doing 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.250
 pass longs to your own field and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.739
 you could even get it without touching 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
 the ground score goal I was not so good 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.459
 because I was more of super nintendo and of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.890
 90 I could only play at friends' house 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.319
 but hey it 's a very game 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.420
 emblematic and the truth is that apart from 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.629
 want to kill your goalkeeper when 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 suddenly because if you automatically pass 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.810
 to control defense to control the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.819
 goalkeeper if you realize it goes wrong and the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.890
 another can put in the console hits golf 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.769
 easy easy easy and you eat that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.540
 So static and beautiful celebration of 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.810
 all ways after sinking from playing 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.579
 as eighth-finals quarterfinals 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.920
 fight and thrash 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.019
 to the rival team in the final I did this 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.329
 come at least now there will be a 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.489
 final animation a celebration exceeds 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.430
 something not something pretty to finish 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.280
 the game and for me they stick this photo 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.770
 with this this kind of organ 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.180
 crappy 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:29.960
 of church or something and that's it and you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.550
 you stay after having gotten 6 5 6 and 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.840
 8 goals to your rivals 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.430
 you look silly good 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.810
 now I put the one that is probably 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 the most gloomy announcement in history 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.250
 on TV like that with that voice from beyond the grave 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.319
 and says the boy if you with your good friend 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.170
 you know what you are doing dark 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.219
 ayayay pillines are you running that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.219
 it seems porter crist 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.470
 come come come closer the command to the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.270
 face so you can press the buttons with 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.760
 the damn nose you see this is what 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.860
 happened in the 90s because they did good 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.410
 like playing video games was like 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.810
 a sect join my sect and play 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.280
 with me, join together, sure that after 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.420
 of that your mother wanted to buy you the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.420
 safe console and let's go 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.450
 of the heroes with the dry game console 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.260
 let's go with the world cup use 94 game 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.480
 US official World Cup in 1994 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.240
 He left for megadrive is made of super 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.970
 nintendo master system even for ms 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.950
 two friends basically all the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.810
 consoles that were active first there are 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.610
 that highlight the menu system that was 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.110
 a very rare thing without letters that was the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.880
 dog with the cup the dog with the ball the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.290
 dog with cones but with Notepad 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840
 dog with things and you had to go 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.980
 guessing more or less and teams the 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.850
 team skills were divided 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.770
 to run in and shoot you basically 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 you had to choose you could not simulate the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.120
 parties you could place different 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.640
 alignment is you can do 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.050
 enough things although the only thing that 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.650
 really apart from playing the world 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.820
 could you do was play 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.130
 workouts without anyone on the other side of 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.870
 on the other side and running you fed up for 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.040
 start to control well even so the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.530
 Game control was quite 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.960
 very poor and as much as you insist 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.970
 is the ball you suddenly went the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.580
 I took the opposite and you can throw yourself 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.610
 all the time there playing and doing everything 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.669
 so that in three passes point 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.189
 italy the opposite team goal of the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.389
 Go machine was that easy and I think 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.520
 which is also because it is developed 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.590
 because you are gold that is the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.469
 developer that American then 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.939
 clear it was like more than just a video game 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.409
 let's create we want is to make a 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.909
 video game we do not have to make a 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.310
 video game for the world cup as a 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.139
 more marketing task than anything else and 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.930
 this is the penalty that was wasted 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.849
 the license of the World Cup that does not 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.550
 that of the players because there was not 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.990
 none with a real name like it used to 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.210
 at that time that no game had 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.889
 licenses at that time I played 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.240
 much more and probably those that 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.699
 you are seeing us that back then 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.259
 you play videogames or you have more to this 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.469
 fifa international soccer the first fifa 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.849
 of history the first fifa than that the 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.159
 game that really set us at the best 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.439
 and make that qualitative leap and that 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.419
 really made a difference and the 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.969
 good by the hand of ea already started the 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.500
 things to change because the truth is that 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.000
 contributed a lot in this regard to the 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.439
 videojuegos sports I leave you so that 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.430
 ye click agree that window

 about about fifa international 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.020
