00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.540
 hello today from the kitchen we are going to prepare 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.790
 a very rich dish of Cochabamba origin 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.400
 which is peak taste or cheesecake as 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.650
 I used to tell him about chiquitita is very rich 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.780
 very healthy and especially easy to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.210
 to do on the counter is to put together a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.210
 linen crown 40 sugar 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.000
 I return to baking instead of yeast 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.510
 he puts him 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.730
 and we're going to incorporate ointment butter 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.750
 about 2 teaspoons and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.750
 we mix the ingredients 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.399
 once incorporated 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.960
 next egg so that the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.690
 yellow pigmentation 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 very slight 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.070
 and warm milk 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 also that we are adding 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 mixing mixing while mixing 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.189
 prepare at home they will give the rich that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.189
 they are there is 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 now if we start kneading 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.510
 let's knead until there is a bun 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.930
 smooth homogeneous 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.890
 we break mass together we see more 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.890
 unite 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.320
 smooth tender the house we have the mass 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 list we are going to do 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.500
 two units to show 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.500
 now a lot toxic 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.940
 let's throw flour 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.940
 quite on the counter 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 with the help of a stick we will stretch you 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.590
 putting together a circle of a similar size 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.590
 to a top of empanadas yes 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.690
 it is a place 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.690
 stretch 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.180
 there is 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.180
 let's put together our topical quiz 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.210
 let's use the whites that we 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 left over we throw on our round 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.750
 and we passed it on the surface to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.240
 that's good because the whites help 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.760
 Adhere one layer of the dough with another 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.010
 then to stick together where their 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.830
 rigid horse and apart do not escape 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.220
 the cheese will serve us a lot 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.160
 onions previously sautÃ©ed with salt 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.640
 super easy pepper and pretty like that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.860
 when I started overflow cheese onion 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.720
 we go with the cheese for health of 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.800
 Barraza mozzarella cheese is like that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.610
 melt it would disarm everything 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.810
 but this as it is said is resistant to 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.860
 high temperatures and it looks great 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.860
 with a little more 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.040
 to one we put a little chili but 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.520
 very little that this one does for my dad 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.740
 who likes intense well 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:48.850
 we grab a cap we crush 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.170
 we eliminate all excess air without 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.120
 we crush 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.120
 and we started in a simple cabbage 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.549
 we crush 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 we are going to put a little bit of 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.500
 egg white to paint 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.879
 Paprika requirement very little because 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.719
 inside I put him quite and by the 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.719
 soaked will be jumping 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.280
 already be notes let's go with it 's over 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.280
 we crush the edges 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.820
 and we started doing that powder again 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.330
 from outside to inside pressing what 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.330
 we make fast 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.919
 we make it clear 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.229
 it's more that they can give a touch more 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.500
 Bittersweet with sugar that to taste 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.390
 each plate floured with 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.720
 flour and we avoid sticking 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.450
 Place in an oven at 180 degrees 20 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.940
 minutes we have our with your peak 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.680
