00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.200
 super super easy i will just have one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 picture on pinterest 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.320
 we now really have the recipe but yes the picture 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 speech before him with his puff pastry 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.670
 and then contains nutella and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.220
 marshmallows so it's nice and sweet 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 kind of variation on the apple flap 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
 and yes you just have my dad 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 ingredients needed first of course 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 to marshmallows i just have a bag 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 at the eyes are bought from haribo with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 pink and white marshall charge 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.140
 I go beyond the use of white 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 you still need the filling 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 nutella this is a very small mini 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 sign I bought 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.969
 at the airport in poland i don't know 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.219
 where they could buy more but 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.410
 threw pot nutella a pressure the same 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 content is a much defender but me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 so I only have that little one 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.190
 pots in houses are treasures and if 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 I just knew about the puff pastry 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.469
 those of merchants in butter variant 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 but I already cater for every kind at 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.300
 empty suits just yet 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 or who or in the supermarket 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.260
 start with the marshmallows first 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 what we are going to do is move marchlessly 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.369
 cut small pieces 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 Also has mini marshmallows but if you like 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.060
 just have big machines like I have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 you first put them in half and then in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 three or four pieces per marshall you have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 about eight small pieces and this goes 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.820
 we use for a flap 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.579
 you grab a piece of puff pastry this will 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 thawed, this will have to lay soft 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.000
 when 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 and then we go this imaginary line 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.229
 draw diagonally 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.329
 then to a chance in the middle we go 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.009
 put the filling down 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.869
 we start with the count now but because 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 my jar is so small 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.810
 soon the nicest feeling on 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.930
 earth just in one 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.860
 count fresh smooth layer now and then 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 we will place a nutella plate here 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.060
 in the middle of half of it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 flap 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 then I pick up the pieces 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:11.050
 marshmallow and this I lay in the we 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.150
 count here when I'm done with this 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.760
 I grab one point of the puff pastry and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.950
 these lead to the other point 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 what i do then is i grab a fork 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.030
 and then I press well so that the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.040
 top and bottom of it 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.040
 puff pastry is connected 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.600
 when all flat is ready then I lay 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.750
 put them on a baking sheet and the baking sheet that 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.310
 I have already covered with aluminum foil and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.560
 what I do then is discuss it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.510
 she covers a little in water and then 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.400
 I sprinkle a whatsapp over it and 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.860
 then I slide them into the oven 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 this should now be about 10 minutes that the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.470
 take fifteen minutes 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.470
 at 225 degrees 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.910
 after the result is really super tasty 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 it's a bit similar to 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.290
 of the chocolate buns only it is 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
 then just slightly sweeter because here so 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.280
 also were marshmallows 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.930
 you do not really eat anything of that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.640
 back you see something of it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.790
 light brown wall is therefore a bit 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.440
 mixed with the nutella and yes the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.290
 inside is nice and sweet and outside 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.680
 nice and crispy and crispy 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.480
 and I'm going to eat this and my book 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.579
 read brushing teeth and then nice 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.440
 sleep and bed if you have more 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.390
 want to see cooking clips 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.040
 my sisters what is it and i'm going with 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.670
