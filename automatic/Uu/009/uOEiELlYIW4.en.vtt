00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 rediscover allandroid vice readers 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.569
 mountain but today we are in a basket of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.820
 samsung galaxy s 4 we find a rom 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.250
 custom based however on the firmware 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
 official for google devices 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.929
 playstation that has been re-launched with 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.859
 android 50 nodes 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.859
 just a few days 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.710
 at the moment there is not much to do on the software 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.960
 say it is about android 5.0 lollipop 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.730
 as well as mom google did it 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.620
 true positive aspect however is that it is not there 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.480
 not even anything negative to report 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.580
 the software is exactly the same as 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.560
 that of nexus and various google 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.119
 edition already in circulation 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.800
 you will then have all the new features 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.690
 introduced with hip hop 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.820
 yet all its little seeds bugs 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.110
 hidden in a couple of days of testing 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.030
 I am satisfied with the whole package 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.140
 software that runs very smoothly and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.270
 smoothly 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 the battery is notable there is only some 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.990
 random reboot and that every now and then 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 verifies but that the developer ensures 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.179
 it can be solved with the installation 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.310
 of a dedicated custom kernel coming 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.320
 however in the coming days of android 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.789
 5.0 lollipop aspects more 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.590
 undoubtedly interesting are the 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.110
 material design that involves all 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 system applications and makes organic 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.040
 google application graphics 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.810
 the lockscreen with the screen of 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.150
 view notifications and one of 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.829
 those functions little fancy but 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.170
 which is difficult to do without 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.299
 once you get used to using them 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.759
 iquique dynamic toggles have aroused 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.040
 conflicting opinions undeniably have 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.630
 added speed of access but many 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.549
 they were displaced by the new one 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.649
 configuration is impossible to set 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.299
 the silent mode or at least it is 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.939
 impossible to do it the way we are 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 accustomed to some it's just a natural one 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.079
 evolution of the function within reach 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.850
 introduction of the priority of 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.239
 notifications for others is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.600
 simply a serious android bug 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.920
 5.0 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.630
 about priorities in the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 settings you will find the card 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.769
 actually dedicated to progress 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.269
 due but I am sure we will employ a 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.880
 some time to learn how to use it 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.680
 completely logical for the rest 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.510
 to approve was nothing but to do 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.130
 a personal idea of ​​how it goes and how not 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.260
 go to find a personal position 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.480
 within the debate that one is 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.030
 created in the last month really a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.160
 great job as usual 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 by independent developers of xda 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.920
 this stuff works really well and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.650
 android 5.0 works really well too 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 on this samsung galaxy s 4 if you want 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.400
 try it, all that remains is to consult 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.319
 our forum where you can find the guide for 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.310
 installation is also the guide for 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.110
 update 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.239
 if you have already installed the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.690
 previous version of this rom based 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.010
 on android 4.4.4 the card for the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.050
 that's all if you have any questions
