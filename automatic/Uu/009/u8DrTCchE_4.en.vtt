00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
try to shoot you through the side

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.620 
try to shoot you through the side
windows

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
windows

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.030 
windows
they're<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.500> able<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> kill<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they're not going to be able to kill you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.399 
they're not going to be able to kill you
which<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> massive<00:01:35.970> advantage<00:01:36.409> driving

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
which is a massive advantage driving

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.600 
which is a massive advantage driving
around<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.040> truck<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> actually

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
around on this this truck is actually

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630 
around on this this truck is actually
also<00:01:39.290> extremely<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.650> stunting<00:01:41.159> now<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
also extremely good for stunting now you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
also extremely good for stunting now you
can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> actually<00:01:42.450> ran<00:01:42.899> over<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
can see there I actually ran over that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
can see there I actually ran over that
bike<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.829> didn't<00:01:44.159> destroy<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> vehicle<00:01:45.149> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
bike it didn't destroy the vehicle in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
bike it didn't destroy the vehicle in
any<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.659> obviously<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> tires<00:01:46.890> aren't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
any way obviously the tires aren't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
any way obviously the tires aren't
bulletproof<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.820> they<00:01:47.970> set<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> fire<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
bulletproof so they set on fire the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.380 
bulletproof so they set on fire the
tires<00:01:49.340> are<00:01:50.340> basically<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> only<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
tires are basically the only thing on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
tires are basically the only thing on
this<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.780> isn't<00:01:52.079> bulletproof<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.799> go

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this that isn't bulletproof you can go

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
this that isn't bulletproof you can go
around<00:01:53.159> driving<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.479> isn't

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
around driving it it actually isn't

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
around driving it it actually isn't
explosive<00:01:55.530> proof<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.490> blow

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
explosive proof so you can actually blow

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.969 
explosive proof so you can actually blow
it<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> throw<00:01:57.719> c4<00:01:58.229> after<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.649> sticky

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it up if you throw c4 after or sticky

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.260 
it up if you throw c4 after or sticky
bombs<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> can't<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.610> blow<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.119> but

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
bombs you can't actually blow it up but

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.209 
bombs you can't actually blow it up but
you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.630> me<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.990> crashing<00:02:01.829> into<00:02:02.040> tons

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you can see me here crashing into tons

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.120 
you can see me here crashing into tons
of<00:02:02.399> cars<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.570> lasts<00:02:04.439> absolutely

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of cars this thing lasts absolutely

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.260 
of cars this thing lasts absolutely
forever<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> said<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.000> bulletproof

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
forever like I said it's bulletproof

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.510 
forever like I said it's bulletproof
it's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> explosive<00:02:07.170> proof<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> go

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's not explosive proof so if you go

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's not explosive proof so if you go
around<00:02:08.789> crashing<00:02:09.270> into<00:02:09.450> cars<00:02:09.660> eventually<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
around crashing into cars eventually it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.970 
around crashing into cars eventually it
is<00:02:10.619> gonna<00:02:10.860> blow<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.599> extremely

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
is gonna blow up but it's it's extremely

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910 
is gonna blow up but it's it's extremely
it's<00:02:14.280> more<00:02:14.660> durable<00:02:15.660> than<00:02:16.080> any<00:02:16.290> other<00:02:16.470> vehicle

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it's more durable than any other vehicle

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's more durable than any other vehicle
in<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.250> game<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.610> absolutely<00:02:18.030> amazing<00:02:18.269> so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
in the game it's absolutely amazing so
