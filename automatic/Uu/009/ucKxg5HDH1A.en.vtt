00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
notice there's little groups right here

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.630 
notice there's little groups right here
that<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:39.470> actually<00:00:40.470> meet<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.220> with<00:00:41.460> the

that kind of actually meet up with the
tabs<00:00:41.910> from<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.710> head<00:00:43.710> gaskets<00:00:44.220> so<00:00:44.600> maybe

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
tabs from the head gaskets so maybe

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.329 
tabs from the head gaskets so maybe
that's<00:00:45.839> just<00:00:46.079> used<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> liner<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:47.129> don't

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
that's just used as in the liner I don't

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.890 
that's just used as in the liner I don't
know<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> seems<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.540> out<00:00:48.690> pretty

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
know but it seems to work out pretty

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.680

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
well so they said to put a little bit of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.200 
well so they said to put a little bit of
RTV<00:00:52.559> black<00:00:53.089> just<00:00:54.089> as<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.300> stick<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.409> first

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
RTV black just as a stick it on first

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
RTV black just as a stick it on first
okay<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.199> let<00:00:58.409> it<00:00:58.439> sit<00:00:58.769> out<00:00:58.939> all<00:00:59.939> right

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
off some of the older material as you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.690 
off some of the older material as you
can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> got<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.950> got<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> gaskets<00:01:26.549> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
can see I got the got the gaskets in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
can see I got the got the gaskets in
already<00:01:27.140> grabbed<00:01:28.140> apply<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:28.980> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
sealant sealing at the edges so we've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
sealant sealing at the edges so we've
got<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.730> silicones<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.770> said<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> put<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
got our silicones in just said to put it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:02:20.510 
got our silicones in just said to put it
at<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.750> edges<00:01:40.140> here

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520

the intake on to the heads under the
engine<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.070> should<00:03:25.220> say<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.120> put<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.540> your

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
engine I should say then put on your

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.870 
engine I should say then put on your
accessories<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:30.160> got<00:03:31.160> that<00:03:31.310> tightenings<00:03:31.700> I've

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
accessories so got that tightenings I've

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.410 
accessories so got that tightenings I've
already<00:03:32.180> tightening<00:03:32.570> down<00:03:34.420> initially

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
already tightening down initially

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.650 
already tightening down initially
there's<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.470> specific<00:03:37.010> sequence<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.670> we're

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
there's a specific sequence so we're

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.110 
there's a specific sequence so we're
going<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> start<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.200> out<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:39.710> one<00:03:40.120> ear

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
going to start this out it's one ear

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:51.869 
going to start this out it's one ear
