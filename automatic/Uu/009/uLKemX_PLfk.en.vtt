00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
sweet and this tree is ginormous I just
came<00:01:31.439> across<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.979> reminds<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> avatar<00:01:33.060> like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
came across it reminds me of avatar like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
came across it reminds me of avatar like
that<00:01:33.450> giant<00:01:33.810> giant<00:01:33.990> avatar<00:01:34.590> tree<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that giant giant avatar tree but

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.080 
that giant giant avatar tree but
obviously<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
obviously that was going to be a lot

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
obviously that was going to be a lot
bigger<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.350> ahead<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.009> fly

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bigger so if we go ahead and just fly

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
bigger so if we go ahead and just fly
around<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> look<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.900> world<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
around and look at some of the world you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.069 
around and look at some of the world you
can<00:01:40.979> notice<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:42.299> different<00:01:42.750> than

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
can notice it is a lot different than

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
can notice it is a lot different than
normal<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.549> definitely

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
normal this is going to be definitely

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.310 
normal this is going to be definitely
not<00:01:45.119> your<00:01:45.240> normal<00:01:45.360> minecraft<00:01:45.659> world<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
not your normal minecraft world as you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.929 
not your normal minecraft world as you
can<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.740> trees<00:01:47.009> over<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.490> are

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
can see these trees over here are

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.069 
can see these trees over here are
definitely<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.630> different<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
definitely going to be different as you

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.210 
definitely going to be different as you
can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> different

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
can see this is going to be a different

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
can see this is going to be a different
type<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> wood<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.509> said<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:51.869> lots<00:01:52.020> of

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
really all mixed up like sometimes

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140 
really all mixed up like sometimes
you'll<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:23.010> trees<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.430> sometimes<00:02:24.000> you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
you'll get these trees and sometimes you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.880 
you'll get these trees and sometimes you
could<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.600> normal<00:02:25.020> trees<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.380> mean<00:02:25.740> it's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
could just get normal trees I mean it's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.340 
could just get normal trees I mean it's
really<00:02:26.130> weird<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.390> really<00:02:27.750> cool<00:02:28.050> mod

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
really weird but it is a really cool mod

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.890 
really weird but it is a really cool mod
now<00:02:28.950> honestly<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.610> my<00:02:29.640> opinion<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.630> going

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
now honestly in my opinion this is going

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.480 
now honestly in my opinion this is going
to<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.080> something<00:02:31.320> kind<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.010> biomes

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
to be something kind of like the biomes

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.680 
to be something kind of like the biomes
