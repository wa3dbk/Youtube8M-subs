00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.719
 clermont won only one match on 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.219
 the last ten the men of regis 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.720
 brouard will try to impose on 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.680
 home against auxerre two teams 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.500
 very close to the ranking 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.300
 the ninth against the 11th 1 point 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.230
 difference between the two clubs 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 before this game because we are unbeaten at 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.330
 home 3 wins but four draws 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.350
 capelle and plaited in the ranks 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.550
 Clermont Auxerrois side everything is better 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.050
 a defeat only on the four 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.750
 last matches two wins in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.180
 this series the gia is a little bit 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.530
 go up the rankings 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 you have to play this time without ramos 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.540
 mauconduit and haddad who are in phase 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.440
 of recovery 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.480
 because we have the first balloons 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.149
 interesting to try to find 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.950
 the path of victory 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.489
 this beautiful overflow and the possibility of 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.809
 center the recovery missed because the defense 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.809
 folds in extremis 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.330
 clermont who dominates this first 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.649
 period and who insist with a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.190
 new breakthrough and pass in the back 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.210
 of the defense 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.030
 the exit of the guardian in the intervention 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.159
 of sorin olive tree to hinder the strike 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.510
 adverse 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.760
 clermont is still the most 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.189
 enterprising a free kick over 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.680
 then this fault that causes a 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.490
 yellow card issued by the referee of the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.610
 match and william screw at half-time 0 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.410
 at 0 a result that remains interesting 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.220
 for aj auxerre 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.130
 auxerre has never won away 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 this season 2 draws and 4 losses worse 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.010
 the Auxerre have scored only two goals 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.290
 far from their bases it would be 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.050
 change the situation and why not 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.000
 on the lawn of Clermont - Ferrand by train 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.560
 to doubt clearly no longer gained from 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.880
 match since three meetings 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.960
 the second period with always a 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.510
 Clermont team a little bit more 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.460
 entrepreneurial and auxerre who shows 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.410
 his ease when there are recoveries 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.300
 of ball to his guests like this one the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.650
 strikes and the rescue of fabien 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 farnolle the international goalkeeper 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.620
 Beninois de Clermont saves his team 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.180
 near the end of the game 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.220
 a new attacked balloon for the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.810
 Clermont turning the surface 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.790
 Gregory Bettiol He passes a player there in 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.020
 pass 2 and the typing can be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.450
 victorious 86th minute to offer the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.010
 three points in football 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 the third goal of the season for 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.270
 Bettiol 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.270
 a goal that may be very expensive 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.610
 1 0 at the end of the match it's 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.900
 maybe the return of the victory for 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 clermont but there are still some actions 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.830
 and especially this action auxerroises 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.950
 for equalization 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.810
 paul george lepp a few minutes after 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.400
 the opening of the score very close to 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.720
 stoppage 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.670
 fifth goal of the season in mind 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.520
 makes a terrible disillusionment everywhere 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.160
 for clermont who thought to win this match 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.980
 but the Auxerrois pulled out 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.490
 final score 1 everywhere between clermont and 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.490
 auxerre 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860
 this is the plan
