00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.880
 I'm also a school teacher. 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 maranata for about three years or so 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.920
 good at music for me it's my life, me 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 always did it as a child never 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.970
 I thought I would do something else but 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 playing music is to listen to all generates around 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.390
 music to me, so it's my life. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.809
 or the song my first contact was 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.120
 In the church I started at the age of seven. 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:11.159
 is to play a group of young people and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.430
 from then until today I have not stopped 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 As a teacher, I expect total dedication. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 and strength of will also because 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.240
 Sometimes we always try to pass the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.060
 better for them, huh? 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 and we also want them to return 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.369
 for us the best of them also the best 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.150
 way of teaching the student is interacting 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.280
 with him 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.600
 It's what I've always done that I like. 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 do is also for example always 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.159
 working with music is always asking for 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.539
 he bring the songs he has 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 desire to learn 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.229
 that's how we'll work on the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 interacting and making you more comfortable 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.890
 in class 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.229
 Anyway guy is nothing to me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.289
 It's very cool to talk about this because it's a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.869
 family atmosphere in a very 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:07.289
 joy and people here is very good 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.960
 understood then it's 100% joy here to 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.830
 Me, mariata is part of my life. 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.930
 also 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.780
 Dude, what's up, the maranata added to me? 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.740
 was much recognition of others 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.170
 people out to sea are musicians or 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.590
 friends are people who admire my 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 Work, this is the maranatta. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.530
 provided for me and I always try 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 to provide maranatta the best 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.410
 it also ends with a video of my case 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.500
 I thought what the teacher said I 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.150
 I have to define the parana 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.150
 a family word
