 hooked up to the end was they tour 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.520
 Microphone placed

 frame to throw 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:02.170
 so choose pxx 100 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:05.680
 yogi so on we choose as yet 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.360
 so that I could hear them all in a row we 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.500
 choose front level see slain 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 A square was designated, let's rate it like this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.959
 here you were showing us the location 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.739
 speakers, he rather means a microphone 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:28.300
 I have already finished a shot click here 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:33.790
 this here missouri twice and gone 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.620
 it is desirable that there was silence on whether she 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.760
 will think 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.640
 long enough for initially 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.310
 will determine the presence of dynamics of all 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.140
 if the front rear subwoofer 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.700
 left-right 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.769
 I do not understand what for we need the left right 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.530
 determine mean at this moment from 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:03:00.030
 speakers are heard different incomprehensible 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:03.810
 sounds like aliens 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.810
 now they will be heard 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.380
 here are the sounds 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.510
 as you can see the weather is great desirable 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:04:13.940
 the noise was quiet the moment you see yet 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:16.330
 goes left speaker true went mars 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.330
 Mars Mars 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:27.440
 so south i think everything is clear everything is all 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.630
 heard so on i press the groove because 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.250
 that nothing particularly interesting will not 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.750
 only the next one will be 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.750
