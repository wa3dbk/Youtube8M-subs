okay<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:06.800> final<00:00:07.040> fitting<00:00:07.520> for<00:00:07.730> the<00:00:07.850> shell<00:00:08.120> and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
okay the final fitting for the shell and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.320 
okay the final fitting for the shell and
this<00:00:09.680> isn't<00:00:09.889> all<00:00:10.160> of<00:00:10.190> it<00:00:10.430> for<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:10.820> stove<00:00:11.090> it's

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
this isn't all of it for the stove it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.860 
this isn't all of it for the stove it's
just<00:00:11.600> for<00:00:11.809> the<00:00:11.900> shell<00:00:12.170> is<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:14.030> end<00:00:14.240> caps<00:00:14.570> and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
just for the shell is the end caps and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.200 
just for the shell is the end caps and
simply<00:00:15.440> put<00:00:15.650> there<00:00:15.920> are<00:00:15.950> three<00:00:16.280> quadrants<00:00:16.730> BM

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
simply put there are three quadrants BM

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.250 
simply put there are three quadrants BM
en<00:00:17.539> cap<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:19.690> what<00:00:20.690> it's<00:00:20.810> going<00:00:20.870> to<00:00:21.020> look<00:00:21.080> like

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
en cap and what it's going to look like

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.190 
en cap and what it's going to look like
from<00:00:22.160> an<00:00:22.280> n<00:00:22.520> view<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:24.740> we're<00:00:24.920> gonna<00:00:25.070> go<00:00:25.160> 3/4<00:00:25.700> up

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
from an n view is we're gonna go 3/4 up

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.120 
from an n view is we're gonna go 3/4 up
3/4<00:00:27.200> of<00:00:27.260> an<00:00:27.380> inch<00:00:27.500> down<00:00:28.240> over<00:00:29.590> 3/4<00:00:30.590> an<00:00:30.680> inch<00:00:30.890> up

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
3/4 of an inch down over 3/4 an inch up

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.850 
3/4 of an inch down over 3/4 an inch up
three-quarters<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.059> an<00:00:32.180> inch<00:00:32.300> down<00:00:32.710> now<00:00:33.710> this

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
three-quarters of an inch down now this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.830 
three-quarters of an inch down now this
is<00:00:34.010> gonna<00:00:34.160> actually<00:00:34.370> be<00:00:34.700> bent<00:00:34.940> on<00:00:35.149> all<00:00:35.450> sides

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
is gonna actually be bent on all sides

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.770 
is gonna actually be bent on all sides
and<00:00:36.289> so<00:00:36.920> since<00:00:37.760> we<00:00:37.940> need<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.090> top<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.630> bottom

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
and so since we need a top and a bottom

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.800 
and so since we need a top and a bottom
to<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:39.500> need<00:00:39.650> two<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:39.920> them<00:00:40.280> at<00:00:41.380> 23<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:44.660> a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
to this we need two of them at 23 and a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.389 
to this we need two of them at 23 and a
quarter<00:00:45.230> by<00:00:45.489> 23<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:49.550> quarter<00:00:49.910> inches<00:00:50.329> and

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
quarter by 23 the quarter inches and

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.750 
quarter by 23 the quarter inches and
this<00:00:52.399> time<00:00:53.230> we<00:00:54.230> want<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.500> use<00:00:54.649> 24<00:00:55.040> gates<00:00:55.550> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
this time we want to use 24 gates and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.549 
this time we want to use 24 gates and
the<00:00:55.820> reason<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.540> there's<00:00:57.170> going<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.410> be<00:00:57.470> a

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
the reason is that there's going to be a

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.590 
the reason is that there's going to be a
lot<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:57.800> weight<00:00:58.040> on<00:00:58.100> these<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.850> 26<00:00:59.360> gauge

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
lot of weight on these the 26 gauge

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.920 
lot of weight on these the 26 gauge
isn't<00:00:59.809> gonna<00:01:00.020> hold<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:00.410> as<00:01:00.559> well<00:01:05.350> okay<00:01:06.350> now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
isn't gonna hold up as well okay now

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.670 
isn't gonna hold up as well okay now
this<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:08.990> gonna<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.680> feedings<00:01:11.260> layout<00:01:12.260> number

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
this is gonna be feedings layout number

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
this is gonna be feedings layout number
six<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.930> I'm<00:01:14.930> gonna<00:01:15.110> mark<00:01:15.380> these<00:01:15.650> numbers<00:01:16.130> so

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
six and I'm gonna mark these numbers so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.520 
six and I'm gonna mark these numbers so
as<00:01:16.850> they're<00:01:17.120> being<00:01:17.299> assembled<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.990> can<00:01:18.020> keep

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
as they're being assembled you can keep

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.109 
as they're being assembled you can keep
track<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.979> which<00:01:19.190> one<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.490> where<00:01:20.680> now<00:01:21.680> does

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
track of which one is where now does

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.080 
track of which one is where now does
subscribe<00:01:23.119> out<00:01:23.330> this<00:01:23.570> one<00:01:24.880> technically<00:01:25.880> we

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
subscribe out this one technically we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.600 
subscribe out this one technically we
only<00:01:26.240> need<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:27.619> set<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.950> at<00:01:28.040> an<00:01:28.130> inch<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.580> a

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
only need to set it at an inch and a

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.420 
only need to set it at an inch and a
half<00:01:28.640> if<00:01:29.540> you're<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.260> bend<00:01:30.470> this<00:01:30.619> out<00:01:30.860> on

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
half if you're going to bend this out on

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.890 
half if you're going to bend this out on
the<00:01:31.670> bar<00:01:31.850> fold<00:01:32.119> if<00:01:32.240> you're<00:01:32.360> gonna<00:01:32.450> bend<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.810> on

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the bar fold if you're gonna bend it on

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.990 
the bar fold if you're gonna bend it on
the<00:01:33.049> break<00:01:33.260> you'll<00:01:33.950> also<00:01:34.159> want<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.520> do<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.760> three

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the break you'll also want to do a three

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.210 
the break you'll also want to do a three
quarter<00:01:35.390> mark<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:36.590> convenience<00:01:36.770> I'll

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
quarter mark and so for convenience I'll

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.880 
quarter mark and so for convenience I'll
do<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.460> inch<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.760> half<00:01:37.790> first<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
do the inch and a half first then do the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.130 
do the inch and a half first then do the
3/4<00:01:40.549> in<00:01:41.180> case<00:01:41.420> you're<00:01:41.570> gonna<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.960> do<00:01:42.049> it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
3/4 in case you're gonna have to do it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.870 
3/4 in case you're gonna have to do it
on<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.229> break<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.780> basically<00:01:45.080> we're<00:01:45.320> going<00:01:45.409> to

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
on a break so basically we're going to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:59.020 
on a break so basically we're going to
mark<00:01:46.880> inch<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> half<00:01:47.390> on<00:01:47.780> all<00:01:47.960> sides

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.810 

then<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> 3/4<00:02:02.400> flip<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
then if you're gonna do a 3/4 flip it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:20.750 
then if you're gonna do a 3/4 flip it
over<00:02:05.210> do<00:02:06.210> 3/4<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.050> this<00:02:07.260> side<00:02:19.430> flip<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> back

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
over do 3/4 on this side flip it back

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.530 
over do 3/4 on this side flip it back
over<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.800> since<00:02:22.800> these<00:02:23.150> marks<00:02:24.150> probably

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
over and since these marks probably

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.699 
over and since these marks probably
aren't<00:02:24.660> gonna<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.989> showing<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.410> very<00:02:25.739> well

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
aren't gonna be showing up very well

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.250 
aren't gonna be showing up very well
right<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:33.030> where<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> marks<00:02:33.720> intersect

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
right here is where the marks intersect

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920 
right here is where the marks intersect
now<00:02:34.980> what<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
now what we want to do is we want to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.300 
now what we want to do is we want to
take<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.650> want<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> snip<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:40.310> straight

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
take and we want to snip it straight

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.440 
take and we want to snip it straight
across<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.010> little<00:02:44.489> past<00:02:44.790> where<00:02:45.300> those

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
across just a little past where those

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
across just a little past where those
marks<00:02:45.690> intersect<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.950> very<00:02:47.190> minimum

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
marks intersect at the very minimum

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.580 
marks intersect at the very minimum
right<00:02:47.880> where<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.050> do<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
right where but if you do it just a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.979 
right where but if you do it just a
little<00:02:49.620> bit<00:02:50.010> past<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:51.120> gonna<00:02:51.360> make<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.780> lot

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
little bit past it's gonna make it a lot

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.800 
little bit past it's gonna make it a lot
easier<00:02:52.500> when<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.850> go<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.299> assembly<00:02:59.810> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
easier when you go to do assembly you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:23.030 
easier when you go to do assembly you
want<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.739> four<00:03:01.920> corners<00:03:22.040> they

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
want to do that on all four corners they

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.970 
want to do that on all four corners they
do<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.610> both<00:03:23.790> sheets<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.299> metal<00:03:24.980> then

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
do this to both sheets of metal then

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.630 
do this to both sheets of metal then
what's<00:03:26.280> gonna<00:03:26.430> happen<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.600> bar<00:03:27.870> fold

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
what's gonna happen is in the bar fold

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.020 
what's gonna happen is in the bar fold
this<00:03:29.640> will<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:30.000> bent<00:03:30.239> over<00:03:30.480> first<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.709> all<00:03:32.310> four

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
this will be bent over first on all four

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.910 
this will be bent over first on all four
of<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.299> three<00:03:33.510> quarters<00:03:33.780> don't<00:03:34.200> flatten<00:03:34.769> it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
of the three quarters don't flatten it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.490 
of the three quarters don't flatten it
just<00:03:35.280> bend<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.670> over<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.049> flipped<00:03:37.350> in

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
just bend it over then it's flipped in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.539 
just bend it over then it's flipped in
the<00:03:37.650> other<00:03:37.769> side<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.430> Bend<00:03:39.060> up<00:03:39.209> at<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.390> 90<00:03:40.549> first

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
the other side and Bend up at a 90 first

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.030 
the other side and Bend up at a 90 first
thing<00:03:41.820> set<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> bar<00:03:42.720> pull<00:03:42.989> about<00:03:43.200> 3/4<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.920> an

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
thing set the bar pull about 3/4 of an

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.560 
thing set the bar pull about 3/4 of an
inch

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380 

now<00:03:52.570> if<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.840> want<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.400> can<00:03:54.610> cross<00:03:55.030> break

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
now if you want you can cross break

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.600 
now if you want you can cross break
these<00:03:55.680> quite<00:03:56.680> frankly<00:03:57.040> it's<00:03:57.250> not<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.550> to

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
these quite frankly it's not going to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.100 
these quite frankly it's not going to
make<00:03:57.730> much<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.150> difference<00:03:58.300> because<00:03:58.690> all

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
make much of a difference because all

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.810 
make much of a difference because all
the<00:03:59.230> weight<00:03:59.410> on<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.800> is<00:04:00.220> pretty<00:04:00.490> nearly

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
the weight on this is pretty nearly

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.240 
the weight on this is pretty nearly
gonna<00:04:01.150> be<00:04:01.420> right<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.350> corners<00:04:02.830> there's

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
gonna be right at the corners there's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.680 
gonna be right at the corners there's
not<00:04:03.430> gonna<00:04:03.550> be<00:04:03.640> much<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:04.090> far<00:04:04.270> as<00:04:04.360> weight<00:04:04.510> in

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
not gonna be much as far as weight in
