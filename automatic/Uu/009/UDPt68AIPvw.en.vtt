00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 Inn was the background an easy-to-understand Po end of nursing sand 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 It is a place called ts Fu Kasa of on the web design 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 The point allocation starts from zero first, and there is a part to say at the end later 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.230
 By the way, there is a classification of design r called design p right now 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.939
 Both are used but 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.869
 As the newer one is classified as Design r , I will talk about that person this time 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.520
 I will 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.620
 It is a part of design H 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 Well, this is probably the case that so far maybe once in a class that twice a third 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.870
 This will be the decision of the Dean of the individual design but I think that one wore 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:50.110
 0 notation until maybe now the Tteyuu is I think the thing that was not at all, but up to now 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.300
 Once is 8 d 1 will be written twice with a sustained gem 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.060
 When it comes to the sound of b, it is the lower side that is pulled from Izumidake of Orange to the heavy prize v 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.030
 It will have the say is a result severe 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.570
 Of large character 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.970
 Mr. Iino This is yeah 3. I'm together so far 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:12.799
 In this also Kedomo is is you different person I am with 4 degrees to choose the d of Well uppercase 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.100
 It was classified as d's goh and this was the four-degree notation so far 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.020
 And this is a little classified form 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.469
 And one more special thing is that the half umbrella judgment can be done 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 It's because I can say that ud is not so good 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.590
 I will talk based on the photo 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 First of all, it means that d -1 lasting redness 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:39.040
 The redness of the state that the redness does not disappear even if I hit this high pressure and I hit a suita 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.490
 When you want to judge because it shows , push it with your finger 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.190
 Once seemed to immediately return to missing white and color sometimes seen is Sa' 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.900
 It will be 8 d-0 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.900
 If the color is not lost and redness is left, it is judged that d is maintained. 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.220
 I will 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:02.560
 And it is the second d because it will be damage to the dermis layer 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 Easy to say when and called a state in which the thin skin is Perot picking was on the surface of the skin 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.769
 And the third is from here to capitalize and it is damage to the subcutaneous tissue Thin skin is 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:19.440
 It means that tissue damage is in the deeper part than peeled off . 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:22.349
 The child is a classification that has come out a little new, but it reaches to the joint sky vs. sky of here quite 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.620
 This pressure ulcers in the fact that damage 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.120
 I feel like going out here 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 At first glance it looks like it's up, but when you put it in the zone and look at it 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.829
 This is a whitish place with a bone touching part inside 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.909
 So this is a bit deep generic, so it will be judged as a child of d 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:46.650
 It's up to the level that can be confirmed by myself properly after this d 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:49.150
 And d of the unknown world is what can not be uncounted remorse 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 Bet that what kind of situation 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:00.900
 It is such a situation, but it seems to be a common condition 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.209
 It what is not whether the damage of the head when actually far have been covered, such as the stone organization 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.750
 I do not know what to say 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.670
 Because there is no blood flow at all in stone tissue 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.800
 8 not so-called part of my body 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:21.099
 Since it becomes that there is the Tteyuu major with things exist here 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:26.170
 This means that it is judged that the foreign object was on the wound and it is impossible to judge the depth at all. 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.630
 It will pressure ulcers of I mean the yellow was there and I now photos to Fu say, look this way 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.660
 Part probably says this side 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.790
 In door this key 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:40.550
 It is only when you take the part of the delicious organization that you know its true depth . 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 It is the deepest part of the wound to increase the Fu that assumes a portion of the true depth 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.120
 So you can only judge the depth of two talks in that period when the rob of this binding is exposed 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.650
 You of the will to 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.189
 The Tteyuu hot water of d is large in such as this necrotic tissue 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.510
 What is 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:58.950
 The than 1 and three times four times of 3 of pressure ulcers up to now please refer to the decision to Fu that says d 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.110
 I think it will be easier to judge 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.990
 Portal site for nurses . Nursing 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.040
 Medical new Surley 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.910
 Medical video content available Recommended information available 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.910
 There is also information of semi and 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.940
 I had Kyoji to interview a variety of hospital 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.840
 We introduce nurses and everyone who works hard in the hospital 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.389
 Please take a look 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.389
 Idea. Secret word search
