my<00:00:34.469> brief<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> CEO<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> create<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
my brief from the CEO was to create a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
my brief from the CEO was to create a
brand<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.050> was<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.040> premium<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
brand that was a lot more premium that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.520 
brand that was a lot more premium that
was<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.739> said<00:00:44.070> quality<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.570> said<00:00:45.989> style

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
was that said quality that said style

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
was that said quality that said style
that<00:00:46.920> said<00:00:47.219> cool<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.239> said<00:00:48.539> contemporary

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that said cool that said contemporary

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
that said cool that said contemporary
and<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.730> set<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.469> was

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and that is what we set out to do it was

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.150 
and that is what we set out to do it was
so<00:00:53.070> obvious<00:00:53.280> what<00:00:53.730> needed<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.210> happen<00:00:54.239> because

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
so obvious what needed to happen because

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
so obvious what needed to happen because
simplicity<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.399> itself<00:00:56.820> creates<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
simplicity in itself creates the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
simplicity in itself creates the
smartness<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.649> creates<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.340> quality<00:01:00.149> about

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
smartness and it creates a quality about

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.860 
smartness and it creates a quality about
it<00:01:00.539> most<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> aircraft<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> white<00:01:02.870> white

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it most of the aircraft is white white

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
it most of the aircraft is white white
is<00:01:03.930> pure<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.949> white<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.489> clean<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> white<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
clear and that to us was a really

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
clear and that to us was a really
important<00:01:10.170> part<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> brand<00:01:12.080> charcoal<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
will balance it back to the middle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
will balance it back to the middle

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
most exciting part of this job was that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
most exciting part of this job was that
we<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.460> managed<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> evolve<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> Virgin

we have managed to evolve the Virgin

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.420 
we have managed to evolve the Virgin
brand<00:01:44.329> one<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> world's<00:01:46.229> greatest<00:01:46.740> brands

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
brand one of the world's greatest brands

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
brand one of the world's greatest brands
and<00:01:47.640> we've<00:01:48.240> managed<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.640> put<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:50.909> another

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and we've managed to put it on another

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.560 
and we've managed to put it on another
level<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:53.310> build<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> another<00:01:54.240> level

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
level to to build it up to another level

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.230 
level to to build it up to another level
and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> world<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.939> take

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and I think that the world will take

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.439 
and I think that the world will take
notice<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.049> we've<00:01:58.259> done
