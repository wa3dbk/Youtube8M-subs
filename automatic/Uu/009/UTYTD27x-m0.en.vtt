the<00:00:36.960> IR<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.520> 10-point

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the IR because of this it's got 10-point

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
multi-touch technology not only when you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
multi-touch technology not only when you
touch<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.700> different<00:00:42.090> buttons<00:00:42.690> even<00:00:43.110> though

they're not really buttons on the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.560 
they're not really buttons on the
keyboard<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.850> read<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
keyboard it can read that but it can

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
keyboard it can read that but it can
also<00:00:45.690> sense<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> move<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.800> finger

accurate<00:02:48.880> now<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.180> other<00:02:49.389> use<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.690> Tobi<00:02:50.230> gaze

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
accurate now the other use for Tobi gaze

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.990 
accurate now the other use for Tobi gaze
is<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:51.160> when<00:02:51.280> you're<00:02:51.400> looking<00:02:51.670> at<00:02:51.790> something

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
is that when you're looking at something

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699 
is that when you're looking at something
zooming<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.540> on<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.690> map<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.440> use<00:02:53.560> the

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
zooming in on a map you can use the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.650 
zooming in on a map you can use the
roller<00:02:53.889> on<00:02:54.130> your<00:02:54.160> mouse<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.700> zoom<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.630> just

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
roller on your mouse to zoom in but just

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.120 
roller on your mouse to zoom in but just
by<00:02:55.900> looking<00:02:56.290> at<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.410> point<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.889> want<00:02:57.069> to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
by looking at that point you want to

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.920 
by looking at that point you want to
zoom<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.400> then<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.730> focuses<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.540> centers<00:02:58.900> on

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
zoom in then it focuses and centers on

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.599 
zoom in then it focuses and centers on
that<00:02:59.380> point<00:02:59.620> instead<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.099> you<00:03:00.430> know<00:03:00.489> how

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
that point instead of you know how

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.099 
that point instead of you know how
sometimes<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.239> you're<00:03:01.389> in<00:03:01.419> MapQuest<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
sometimes when you're in MapQuest and

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.629 
sometimes when you're in MapQuest and
you<00:03:02.200> zoom<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.739> gets<00:03:02.859> closer<00:03:03.130> but<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.519> not

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
you zoom and it gets closer but it's not

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.800 
you zoom and it gets closer but it's not
centered<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.299> have<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.510> move<00:03:04.690> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
centered and then you have to move it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.379 
centered and then you have to move it
literally<00:03:05.530> all<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.739> have<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.639> is<00:03:06.940> look<00:03:07.239> at

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
literally all you have to do is look at

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.849 
literally all you have to do is look at
it<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.569> get<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.750> chance<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.049> talk<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.380> Sarah<00:03:08.650> over

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
it I get a chance to talk to Sarah over

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.620 
it I get a chance to talk to Sarah over
at<00:03:09.069> Toby<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.549> this<00:03:09.819> is<00:03:09.970> what<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.180> saw<00:03:10.359> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
at Toby and this is what we saw and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.210 
at Toby and this is what we saw and
that's<00:03:10.750> already<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.530> center<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:11.950> everything

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
that's already the center of everything

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.430 
that's already the center of everything
so<00:03:12.760> yeah<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.450> map<00:03:13.599> application<00:03:14.169> here

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
so yeah the map application here

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.690 
so yeah the map application here
let's<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.580> got<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:18.250> too<00:03:19.250> much<00:03:19.400> we

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
let's see there it is got it too much we

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.810 
let's see there it is got it too much we

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
start to use you want to zoom in on you

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.050 
start to use you want to zoom in on you

looking<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.220> build<00:03:52.490> this<00:03:52.790> technology<00:03:53.380> into

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
looking to build this technology into

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.680 
looking to build this technology into
devices<00:03:54.890> as<00:03:55.310> they're<00:03:55.640> manufactured<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.570> it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
devices as they're manufactured so it's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.090 
devices as they're manufactured so it's
not<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.110> consumer<00:03:57.380> product<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.860> can<00:03:57.980> buy

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
not just a consumer product you can buy

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.170 
not just a consumer product you can buy
but<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.370> something<00:03:58.550> that's<00:03:58.670> built<00:03:58.970> in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
but it's something that's built in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.520 
but it's something that's built in
they're<00:03:59.630> working<00:03:59.930> with<00:04:00.050> video<00:04:00.260> game

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
they're working with video game

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.500 
they're working with video game
developers<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.160> try<00:04:01.460> to<00:04:01.550> develop<00:04:01.970> games<00:04:02.180> where

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
developers to try to develop games where

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.060 
developers to try to develop games where
you<00:04:02.600> would<00:04:02.780> incorporate<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.590> use<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.770> the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
you would incorporate the use of the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.040 
you would incorporate the use of the
gaze<00:04:04.280> technology<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.510> there's<00:04:05.690> really<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.960> lot

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
gaze technology so there's really a lot

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.570 
gaze technology so there's really a lot
that<00:04:06.200> can<00:04:06.410> be<00:04:06.470> done<00:04:06.680> with<00:04:06.860> this<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.250> again

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
that can be done with this and again

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.310 
that can be done with this and again
we've<00:04:07.910> seen<00:04:08.150> this<00:04:08.360> here<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> past<00:04:08.900> before

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
we've seen this here in the past before

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.870 
we've seen this here in the past before
but<00:04:09.530> never<00:04:09.770> in<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.010> format<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.430> we<00:04:10.730> as

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
but never in a format that we as

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.030 
but never in a format that we as
consumers<00:04:11.030> can<00:04:11.630> get<00:04:11.750> our<00:04:11.900> hands<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.800> thank

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
consumers can get our hands on so thank
