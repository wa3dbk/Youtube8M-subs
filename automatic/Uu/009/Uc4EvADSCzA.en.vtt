00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.450 
little play i'm not going to bother
taking<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.529> off<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> pain<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
ass there's one right here and this is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.919 
ass there's one right here and this is
another<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.179> they're<00:00:30.779> both

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
another one right here they're both

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.010 
another one right here they're both
connected<00:00:31.170> together<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:33.300> i<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.660> connect

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
connected together and it i have connect

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.280 
connected together and it i have connect
i<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.320> connected<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.030> wires

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
i have connected the these two wires

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.630 
i have connected the these two wires
also<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:41.059> multi-input<00:00:42.059> i<00:00:42.629> guess<00:00:42.989> or

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
also to a multi-input i guess or

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
also to a multi-input i guess or
whatever<00:00:44.719> adapter<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.350> allows<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
whatever adapter and it allows you to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
whatever adapter and it allows you to
adjust<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.700> voltage<00:00:48.420> allows<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> adjust

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
adjust the voltage allows you to adjust

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.580 
adjust the voltage allows you to adjust
the<00:00:50.100> polarity<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.379> ac/dc<00:00:53.219> or

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
the polarity and it's if it's ac/dc or

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.540 
the polarity and it's if it's ac/dc or
the<00:00:55.590> other<00:00:55.710> type<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> car<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the other type of car and I think it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
the other type of car and I think it's
DC<00:00:56.820> current<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.570> yeah<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.469> basically<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.829> want

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
DC current but yeah so basically I want

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.720 
DC current but yeah so basically I want
to<00:00:59.010> show<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> noise<00:01:01.460> well<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> know

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to show you the noise well you know

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.980 
to show you the noise well you know
volume<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.390> whatever<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.570> cools

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
volume or whatever and it really cools

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
volume or whatever and it really cools
the<00:01:07.320> 360<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.310> well<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:11.040> seen<00:01:11.400> any

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the 360 so well that I have not seen any

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
the 360 so well that I have not seen any
other<00:01:11.820> fan<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.510> better<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
other fan that can do this better it's a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
other fan that can do this better it's a
little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.560> different<00:01:13.950> than<00:01:14.100> most<00:01:14.340> ones<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
little bit different than most ones that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
little bit different than most ones that
you<00:01:15.090> saw<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.360> YouTube<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:16.020> mostly<00:01:16.380> they

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you saw on YouTube you know mostly they

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.700 
you saw on YouTube you know mostly they
cut<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> hole<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.150> overall<00:01:19.049> shell<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
cut a hole here on the overall shell and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
cut a hole here on the overall shell and
they<00:01:19.770> stick<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> fan<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.570> these

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
they stick a fan right there but these

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
they stick a fan right there but these
are<00:01:21.869> very<00:01:22.130> intertwined<00:01:23.130> together<00:01:23.369> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
are very intertwined together so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.690 
are very intertwined together so
basically<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.600> sucks<00:01:25.350> air<00:01:25.560> both<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.369> fans

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
basically it sucks air both these fans

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
basically it sucks air both these fans
are<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.060> powerful<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.600> suck<00:01:27.900> air

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
are very powerful and they suck air

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640 
are very powerful and they suck air
through<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.570> heat<00:01:30.930> sinks<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> they

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
through the all the heat sinks and they

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
through the all the heat sinks and they
just<00:01:31.829> push<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> air<00:01:33.540> gets

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just push it all out and the air gets

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
just push it all out and the air gets
like<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.170> suck<00:01:34.470> through<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.770> little

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
like basically suck through these little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
like basically suck through these little
grils<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.780> pushes<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
grils through these and pushes out and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.929 
grils through these and pushes out and
it's<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.460> efficient<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.560> mix<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.680> 360<00:01:41.009> very

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's very efficient and mix up 360 very

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's very efficient and mix up 360 very
very<00:01:42.329> cool<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:43.680> feel<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.070> warmth

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
very cool I don't even feel any warmth

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
very cool I don't even feel any warmth
usually<00:01:44.790> by<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.659> when<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> put

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
usually by the you know when you put

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
usually by the you know when you put
install<00:01:46.680> extra<00:01:46.890> fans<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
install extra fans are in the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
install extra fans are in the
intercooler<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.420> still<00:01:48.780> feel<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> back

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
intercooler you still feel the back

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
intercooler you still feel the back
that's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.460> warm<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
that's a little bit warm but now that I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's a little bit warm but now that I
put<00:01:51.810> them<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.320> strategically<00:01:53.130> right<00:01:53.700> behind

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
put them very strategically right behind

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.230 
put them very strategically right behind
that<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.990> behind<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.820> blow

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that and behind this and they all blow

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.350 
that and behind this and they all blow
the<00:01:57.390> same<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.049> works<00:01:58.969> perfectly<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the same way it works perfectly so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
the same way it works perfectly so
basically<00:02:01.229> let<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.530> turn<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.850> i<00:02:02.939> plug

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
basically let me turn it on and i plug

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.999 
basically let me turn it on and i plug
it<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.979> put<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> halfway<00:02:06.200> hold<00:02:07.200> on

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it in and put it halfway hold on

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.240 
it in and put it halfway hold on
okay<00:02:10.009> halfway

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550 

that's<00:02:16.850> halfway<00:02:17.120> that's<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> noise<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.320> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that's halfway that's the noise that it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's halfway that's the noise that it
makes<00:02:19.960> halfway<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.590> nothing<00:02:21.920> compared

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
makes halfway that is nothing compared

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.630 
makes halfway that is nothing compared
to<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.300> 360<00:02:23.870> fan<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.530> will<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:25.070> 360<00:02:25.490> fan

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
to the 360 fan this will the 360 fan

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.070 
to the 360 fan this will the 360 fan
will<00:02:25.850> mask<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.240> noise<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:26.930> not

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
will mask the noise and you will not

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.820 
will mask the noise and you will not
hear<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.890> difference<00:02:28.220> whatsoever<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:30.650> let's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
hear a difference whatsoever now let's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.990 
hear a difference whatsoever now let's
do<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> way<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.640> little<00:02:34.850> bit

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
do it all the way now it is a little bit

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.800 
do it all the way now it is a little bit
louder<00:02:36.070> but<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> 360<00:02:37.670> will<00:02:37.940> mask<00:02:38.240> some<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
louder but the 360 will mask some of the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.560 
louder but the 360 will mask some of the
noise<00:02:38.959> it's<00:02:39.590> only<00:02:39.709> way<00:02:39.920> slightly<00:02:40.459> noisier<00:02:41.180> but

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
noise it's only way slightly noisier but

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.590 
noise it's only way slightly noisier but
you<00:02:42.470> will<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.770> have<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.070> worry<00:02:43.250> about<00:02:43.600> rrod

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
you will not have to worry about rrod

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.640 
you will not have to worry about rrod
and<00:02:46.120> anything<00:02:47.120> else<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.930> system<00:02:48.350> will<00:02:48.440> not

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and anything else the system will not

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.010 
and anything else the system will not
overheat<00:02:48.950> nothing<00:02:49.550> at<00:02:49.700> blowing<00:02:50.180> air<00:02:50.360> like

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
overheat nothing at blowing air like

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.040 
overheat nothing at blowing air like
crazy<00:02:51.350> out<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:52.209> out<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.660> right<00:02:53.870> now

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
crazy out here out of this right now

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.180 
crazy out here out of this right now
it's<00:02:54.200> actually<00:02:54.500> coming<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.010> top<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
it's actually coming out of the top and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.470 
it's actually coming out of the top and
once<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.520> put<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> shell<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.300> going<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
once you put the shell on it's going to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.370 
once you put the shell on it's going to
concentrate<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.080> through<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:59.380> that's

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
concentrate it through there so that's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.949 
concentrate it through there so that's
my<00:03:00.530> design<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.630> 360<00:03:02.800> mod<00:03:03.800> fan<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.959> comment
