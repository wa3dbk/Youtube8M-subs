00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.789
 estruch is created by a tv look 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.340
 American called reading leeds 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.560
 I leave here the link to your channel and 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.210
 It was translated into Spanish by Fa de las 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.340
 words of fa that I also leave for you 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.110
 here the channel what this tag is about 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.730
 you have to say in a minute the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.830
 maximum number of books that you 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.630
 go through your head and there are three rules 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.009
 very basic the first one is that 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.839
 you can not say go out for example not 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.100
 can i say harry potter or the games 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.890
 of hunger 'but you have to book 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.809
 for the book the second rule is that if 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.949
 the title is very long for example harry 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.050
 Potter and the Deathly Hallows' 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.660
 you can say only relics of death 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.640
 because because it's too long to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.739
 cut it to make everything easier and 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.210
 the third norm is to insure people 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.789
 who is watching the video that you do not cut 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.289
 the video and it only lasts a minute or 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.989
 either show it with a mobile phone or a 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.810
 ipad or anything so I have 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.330
 around here my mobile 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.150
 and well, I had to download a 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.730
 stopwatch because my phone does not have 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.190
 stopwatch and good 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.320
 there is nothing for them to see that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.810
 I do it at the moment and I'm nervous 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.940
 the truth because I can not see that I do not 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.400

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.990
