you<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> good<00:00:59.760> setup<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you now a good setup for this would be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
you now a good setup for this would be
to<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.649> scavenger<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.160> i'm<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.820> i

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
then you can kind of constantly keep

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.740 
then you can kind of constantly keep
picking<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.479> new<00:01:08.150> trophy<00:01:09.150> systems<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
throwing those down to guarantee the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.410 
throwing those down to guarantee the
safety<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.119> camper

safety of your of your little camper

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
safety of your of your little camper
setup<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.729> your

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
setup which is your you know your

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.460 
setup which is your you know your
centric<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:19.049> microwave<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
centric them and your your microwave now

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.359 
centric them and your your microwave now
the<00:01:19.530> microwave<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> slow<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.340> down

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the microwave is going to slow them down

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
the microwave is going to slow them down
then<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.030> gives<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.270> sentry<00:01:21.600> gun<00:01:21.810> enough<00:01:22.110> time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
then that gives a sentry gun enough time

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
then that gives a sentry gun enough time
to<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.310> lock<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.909> target<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.360> kill

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to actually lock on target and kill

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
to actually lock on target and kill
somebody<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> guys<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.520> know

ready and we're always going to capture
this<00:02:32.170> hard<00:02:32.379> point<00:02:32.590> because<00:02:32.980> I've<00:02:33.159> got<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> lot

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
this hard point because I've got a lot

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.390 
this hard point because I've got a lot
on<00:02:33.849> lock<00:02:34.209> right<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:36.269> don't<00:02:37.269> know<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:39.010> main<00:02:39.189> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
on lock right so I don't know the main I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.459 
on lock right so I don't know the main I
guess<00:02:39.579> point<00:02:39.909> that<00:02:40.389> I<00:02:40.420> want<00:02:40.719> to<00:02:40.780> make<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.439> that

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469

it's<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.370> close<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.729> each<00:03:24.819> other<00:03:24.940> is

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
it's kind of close to each other is

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.969 
it's kind of close to each other is
important<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.900> see<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.709> team<00:03:26.889> was

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
important you see like this team was

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.259 
important you see like this team was
just<00:03:27.159> not<00:03:27.310> smart<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:27.939> is<00:03:28.030> why<00:03:28.180> this

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
just not smart so this is why this

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.819 
just not smart so this is why this
worked<00:03:28.629> out<00:03:28.750> very<00:03:28.810> very<00:03:29.109> well<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.590> me<00:03:29.709> and

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
worked out very very well for me and

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.949 
worked out very very well for me and
that's<00:03:30.400> because<00:03:30.609> nobody<00:03:31.209> was<00:03:31.299> throwing<00:03:31.599> EMP

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
that's because nobody was throwing EMP

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.719 
that's because nobody was throwing EMP
grenades<00:03:32.260> nobody<00:03:32.680> was<00:03:32.859> trying<00:03:33.189> to<00:03:33.310> counter

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:33.729 
grenades nobody was trying to counter

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.099 
grenades nobody was trying to counter
we're<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.180> trying<00:03:34.419> to<00:03:34.449> get<00:03:34.569> past<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.989> or

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
we're just trying to get past it or

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.080 
we're just trying to get past it or
they're<00:03:35.229> trying<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:36.159> run<00:03:36.370> through<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.790> or

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
they're trying to to run through it or

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.089 
they're trying to to run through it or
probably<00:03:37.989> knife<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.500> because<00:03:38.769> they<00:03:38.859> didn't

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
probably knife it because they didn't

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.270 
probably knife it because they didn't
realize<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.519> could<00:03:39.669> just<00:03:39.760> shoot<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:42.099> work

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
realize you could just shoot it so work

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.789 
realize you could just shoot it so work

probably didn't necessarily need to have
my<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:22.570> think<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.020> UAV<00:04:23.380> your<00:04:23.529> comedy<00:04:23.830> movie
