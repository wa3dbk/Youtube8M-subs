00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.570
 the nerves in a series includes four 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 models 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.330
 of course, also have the frame specifically 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.980
 to the needs of the big ones 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 Wheels adapted and have some 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 features built in such as the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 x12 plug the axle for a huge 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 statehood in winterberg ensures and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 still a quick change 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 catwalk axis request was it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 Of course , and especially with the cables 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.680
 are longer than at 26 inch wheels 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.930
 We are satisfied with the statehood 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 have a hydro forming upper tube and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.589
 then with trees under pipe we have 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 enough space for a big one here 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.460
 drinking bottle we have enough step 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.080
 freedom, of course, still 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.489
 space for all the other parts that matter 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.160
 are like the band was for example too 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.559
 Somebody has to go somewhere freedom 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 is always a big topic in one and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.800
 think we have solved very well here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.840
 through the husbandry week 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.680
 we refrain from further gadgets and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.750
 additional bed and can use that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 ears strengthen very abandonment meet 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 interpret therefore the nephew were 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.310
 not heavier than the 26 inch 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.530
 frame which frames for a child in a 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.090
 Even stealing yourself have a frame 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.090
 higher stiffness requirements 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.760
 all many parents are new models 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.210
 with take two or shimano circuit 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.070
 fitted 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.230
 these monkey city â€‹â€‹works are new to the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 scold cage can not move forward 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.030
 move away 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 this will hit the chains 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.900
 clearly minimizes twentyniner straight 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.510
 allow downhill high speeds 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.400
 And this switch really helps 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.910
 while on the trail the chain on the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.260
 to hold fourth place 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.390
 now complicated is just playful 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.400
 It is very much in the backyard 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 full with full ball bearings 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.000
 I filled out the filled track covering 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.770
 war very independently 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720
 I think in detail it is now here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.739
 Too much of what you have is the wheel 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.739
 is just stiff 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.110
 The lever is a game for tomorrow's bikes 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.209
 you will not pay the ps but the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.849
 compare frame data in ours 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.220
 public 1 series has a 70 degrees 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.480
 turn 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.459
 We have found that deliverers 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.530
 think of one like that 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.170
 understeer do not produce what I do 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.439
 pleasant horse we have a lot of 70 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.540
 Seater angle for top performances that 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.459
 Radstadt I express like a chamois and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.739
 That's the nice thing about a tour 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.750
 Finding one you do not have to be so extreme 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.940
 Sporty sitting like a marathon 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.440
 racer and still can climb steeply 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.579
 really very very good boot 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.579
 blocked terrain
