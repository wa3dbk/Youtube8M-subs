00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
things but it's it's so so good to play

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.010 
things but it's it's so so good to play
it's<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.760> tell<00:04:06.510> what's<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> best<00:04:06.960> thing

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
it's really tell what's the best thing

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.960 
it's really tell what's the best thing
to<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.380> play<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.680> with<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> friend<00:04:08.190> because

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
to do is play it with a friend because

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.060 
to do is play it with a friend because
it's<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.300> lot<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.630> fun<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.560> think<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.040> a

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
it's a lot of fun and I think this is a

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.630 
it's a lot of fun and I think this is a
fiver<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.780> off<00:04:13.230> just<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> things<00:04:14.280> it's

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
fiver and it's off just the things it's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.310 
fiver and it's off just the things it's
really<00:04:15.000> realistic<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:15.960> going<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.200> be

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
really realistic it's not going to be

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.430 
really realistic it's not going to be
your<00:04:16.590> call<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.950> duty<00:04:17.870> or<00:04:18.870> your<00:04:19.020> battlefield

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
your call of duty or your battlefield

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460 
your call of duty or your battlefield
but<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.730> sort<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> realistic<00:04:21.900> FPS

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
but it's a sort of a realistic FPS

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.390 
but it's a sort of a realistic FPS
definitely<00:04:24.340> worth<00:04:24.460> getting<00:04:25.020> right<00:04:26.130> next<00:04:27.130> one

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
definitely worth getting right next one

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.390 
definitely worth getting right next one
far<00:04:28.030> cry<00:04:28.210> two<00:04:28.440> lots<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.590> people<00:04:29.980> complained
