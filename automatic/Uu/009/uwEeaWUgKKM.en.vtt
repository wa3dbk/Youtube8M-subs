now<00:00:00.840> as<00:00:01.050> far<00:00:01.290> as<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.560> race<00:00:01.740> truck<00:00:02.010> goes<00:00:02.250> and

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
now as far as the race truck goes and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.679 
now as far as the race truck goes and
what<00:00:02.580> we're<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.449> we're

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
what we're going to do to it today we're

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.480 
what we're going to do to it today we're
pretty<00:00:03.899> much<00:00:04.080> done<00:00:04.470> but<00:00:04.859> now<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.040> can<00:00:05.250> shift

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
pretty much done but now we can shift

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.340 
pretty much done but now we can shift
gears<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.879> come<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.120> over<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.690> truck<00:00:06.990> now

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
gears and come on over to this truck now

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.419 
gears and come on over to this truck now
this<00:00:07.529> truck<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.799> not<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> race

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
this truck is not going to be a race

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.490 
this truck is not going to be a race
truck<00:00:08.670> right<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.090> that's<00:00:09.210> no<00:00:09.450> excuse<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
truck right but that's no excuse as to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.230 
truck right but that's no excuse as to
why<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.830> can't<00:00:11.040> step<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.610> performance<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
why we can't step up the performance a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.669 
why we can't step up the performance a
little<00:00:12.360> bit<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.780> we're<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.500> that

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
little bit and we're going to do that

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.560 
little bit and we're going to do that
with<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.950> intake<00:00:14.280> system<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:15.120> speed<00:00:15.389> by

couple minutes and a couple nuts and
bolts<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.480> pretty<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.809> set<00:00:37.140> now

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
bolts and you're pretty much set now

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
bolts and you're pretty much set now
with<00:00:37.710> any<00:00:37.860> air<00:00:38.070> intake<00:00:38.730> system<00:00:39.149> performance<00:00:39.690> 1

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
with any air intake system performance 1

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.760 
with any air intake system performance 1
you're<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> number<00:00:40.590> of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you're going to get a number of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110 
you're going to get a number of
increases<00:00:41.309> first<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
increases first of all it's going to be

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
increases first of all it's going to be
all<00:00:42.329> about<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> performance<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.530> you're

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
all about the performance because you're

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
all about the performance because you're
getting<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.280> air<00:00:44.520> flow<00:00:45.000> into<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> engine

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
getting more air flow into the engine

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
getting more air flow into the engine
better<00:00:46.020> air<00:00:46.200> flow<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.739> better

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
better air flow you get better

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
better air flow you get better
performance<00:00:47.399> better<00:00:48.120> horsepower<00:00:48.690> better

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
performance better horsepower better

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
performance better horsepower better
torque<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> better<00:00:49.710> fuel<00:00:50.010> economy<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.789> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
torque and better fuel economy now what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
torque and better fuel economy now what
makes<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.360> system<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.809> stand<00:00:52.170> apart

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
makes this system really stand apart

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
makes this system really stand apart
from<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> competitors<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> fact<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
from the competitors the fact that it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
from the competitors the fact that it's
got<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.000> full<00:00:54.329> four<00:00:54.600> inch<00:00:54.780> tube<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
got a full four inch tube going all the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.860 
got a full four inch tube going all the
way<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> engine<00:00:56.430> now<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.390> idea

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
way back into the engine now the idea

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.299 
way back into the engine now the idea
with<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> other<00:00:59.070> ones<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
with it is a lot of the other ones you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.590 
with it is a lot of the other ones you
have<00:00:59.340> an<00:00:59.640> issue<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> mass<00:01:00.300> airflow

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have an issue with the mass airflow

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
have an issue with the mass airflow
sensor<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.379> step<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.460> about

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
sensor so they step it down to about

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.060 
sensor so they step it down to about
three<00:01:02.969> inches<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> where<00:01:03.570> stock<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
three inches to where stock is what the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.490 
three inches to where stock is what the
people<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.400> Spectre<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
people at Spectre do is you put a little

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
people at Spectre do is you put a little
reducer<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> place<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.460> way<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.820> mass

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
reducer in place this way your mass

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
reducer in place this way your mass
airflow<00:01:09.210> sensor<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.260> bogus

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
airflow sensor doesn't get any bogus

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
airflow sensor doesn't get any bogus
readings<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> still<00:01:11.430> reads<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.939> your

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119

factory settings you're not going to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
factory settings you're not going to
have<00:01:13.439> any<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.830> problems<00:01:14.280> what's<00:01:14.909> nice

another<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.640> kit<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.030> specifically

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
another thing this kit was specifically

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
another thing this kit was specifically
made<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.110> truck<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.579> also

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
made for this truck right but it's also

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
made for this truck right but it's also
got<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> max<00:01:36.450> horsepower<00:01:37.049> rating<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
got a max horsepower rating which is

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
got a max horsepower rating which is
nice<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> whole<00:01:38.460> hyper<00:01:38.939> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
nice that's what that whole hyper thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.950 
nice that's what that whole hyper thing
comes<00:01:39.479> into<00:01:39.630> play

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
comes into play

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960 
comes into play
it's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.200> horsepower<00:01:40.710> rating<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.070> each<00:01:41.250> kit<00:01:41.640> has

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it's a horsepower rating so each kit has

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
it's a horsepower rating so each kit has
a<00:01:42.000> maximum<00:01:42.479> rating<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> handle

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a maximum rating of what it can handle

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460 
a maximum rating of what it can handle
this<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.189> specifically<00:01:44.720> 680<00:01:45.720> horsepower<00:01:45.990> I

this one specifically 680 horsepower I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
this one specifically 680 horsepower I
don't<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:46.950> we'll<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.159> anywhere<00:01:47.579> near<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
don't think we'll get anywhere near that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
don't think we'll get anywhere near that
anytime<00:01:48.299> soon<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.680> kit

pull all the stock off right here what I
can<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.479> take<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.140> plug<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
can do is just take this out plug it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.319 
can do is just take this out plug it
right<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.909> we'll<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> ready<00:02:00.270> to
