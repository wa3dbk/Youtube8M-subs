 to open the eggs and the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.530
 Drain the sour cherries and then see 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.300
 we continue 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:31.980
 I have the mother in the trunk done 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:34.980
 Now I add the three eggs and the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.980
 back mix 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.850
 So I will now with the mixer three 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.850
 minutes at the highest level to a dough 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.850
 mix 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.810
 so the three brits are around and the dough 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.990
 is now finished now I will be the chocolate 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.200
 Add flakes and briefly below 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.200
 stir 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.910
 Now I do the form greasing something 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.140
 I'll take rama for that 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.180
 so I have rubbed the baking mold 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.789
 Now I will do the dough in this form 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.280
 fill it in and then everything evenly 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.940
 Trash so that everything hears the same 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.110
 So I never springform the dough 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.440
 awarded filled nice and smooth 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.009
 and now I will be the sour cherry the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.030
 I dripped off here on the 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.979
 distribute surface 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.350
 and I leave a margin of 1 cm 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.669
 so now it looks like the short 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:51.510
 I have distributed a Randlage of 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:54.430
 1 centimeter now I will the oven 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.300
 Preheat and then into the lower third 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:03.699
 push in and the baking time is 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:06.400
 60 minutes so the club natural snow 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.120
 communists the temperature up 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:15.490
 set to 170 degrees 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:20.650
 Now I'm doing the oven and leave 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:24.210
 I now bake an hour for 20 minutes 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.210
 the baking time syndrome 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:40.730
 so now 30 minutes are over so see 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.730
 cake after 40 minutes of baking 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:48.680
 so 50 minutes of the baking time center so 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.680
 another ten minutes 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:57.860
 The 60 minutes are over and I will 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:02.720
 Now in cake from the oven take 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:06.300
 and let the cake cool down 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.870
 I'll serve the cake before serving 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.780
 then sprinkle with powdered sugar and so on 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.540
 the finished cake looks like i think 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.070
