all of the plasma membrane we're gonna

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.460 
all of the plasma membrane we're gonna
do<00:00:16.299> that<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.449> little<00:00:16.630> bit<00:00:16.750> later<00:00:16.900> on<00:00:17.050> all<00:00:17.320> by

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
do that a little bit later on all by

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.609 
do that a little bit later on all by
itself<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:19.000> in<00:00:19.179> endoplasmic<00:00:20.019> reticulum<00:00:20.500> I've

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
itself but in endoplasmic reticulum I've

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.499 
itself but in endoplasmic reticulum I've
already<00:00:20.859> mentioned<00:00:21.099> it<00:00:21.460> when<00:00:22.089> I<00:00:22.210> talk<00:00:22.390> about

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
already mentioned it when I talk about

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.659 
already mentioned it when I talk about
ribosomes<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.949> we<00:00:24.099> talked<00:00:24.310> about<00:00:24.429> the

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
ribosomes and we talked about the

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.769 
ribosomes and we talked about the
endoplasmic<00:00:25.089> reticulum<00:00:25.570> there<00:00:25.720> are

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
endoplasmic reticulum there are

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.310 
endoplasmic reticulum there are
basically<00:00:26.019> two<00:00:26.259> types<00:00:26.400> smooth<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.789> rough<00:00:27.970> ER

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
basically two types smooth and rough ER

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.659 
basically two types smooth and rough ER
rough<00:00:29.320> ER<00:00:29.529> are<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.070> ones<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.400> have

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
rough ER are the ones that have

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.240 
rough ER are the ones that have
ribosomes<00:00:31.480> already<00:00:31.929> attached<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.770> them<00:00:33.010> and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
ribosomes already attached to them and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.610 
ribosomes already attached to them and
smooth<00:00:34.030> ER<00:00:34.180> are<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.719> ones<00:00:34.930> who<00:00:35.079> do<00:00:35.260> not<00:00:35.410> have

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
smooth ER are the ones who do not have

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.799 
smooth ER are the ones who do not have
any<00:00:35.680> ribosomes<00:00:36.370> they<00:00:37.030> both<00:00:37.210> have<00:00:37.390> different

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
any ribosomes they both have different

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.380 
any ribosomes they both have different
jobs<00:00:38.020> which<00:00:38.500> we'll<00:00:38.739> go<00:00:38.980> into<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:40.059> just<00:00:40.270> a

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
jobs which we'll go into in just a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.250 
jobs which we'll go into in just a
second<00:00:40.980> smoothie<00:00:41.980> our<00:00:42.359> main<00:00:43.359> function<00:00:43.660> is<00:00:43.899> for

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
second smoothie our main function is for

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.380 
second smoothie our main function is for
membrane<00:00:44.770> production<00:00:45.340> not<00:00:45.489> only<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:46.000> plasma

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
membrane production not only the plasma

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.060 
membrane production not only the plasma
membrane<00:00:46.809> but<00:00:47.019> also<00:00:47.170> other<00:00:47.530> membranes<00:00:47.980> that

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
membrane but also other membranes that

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.520 
membrane but also other membranes that
are<00:00:48.250> found<00:00:48.460> in<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.670> cell<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.140> we<00:00:50.170> can

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
are found in the cell so we can

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.770 
are found in the cell so we can
synthesize<00:00:50.739> lipids<00:00:51.640> these<00:00:52.120> limpets<00:00:52.390> can<00:00:52.690> be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
synthesize lipids these limpets can be

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.259 
synthesize lipids these limpets can be
used<00:00:52.960> for<00:00:53.140> sex<00:00:53.379> hormones<00:00:53.800> steroids

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
used for sex hormones steroids

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.250 
used for sex hormones steroids
phospholipids<00:00:55.269> all's<00:00:55.480> different<00:00:56.079> things

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
phospholipids all's different things

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.970 
phospholipids all's different things
like<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:57.149> smooth<00:00:58.149> ER<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.660> also<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.320> found<00:00:59.769> in

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
like that smooth ER is also you found in

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.540 
like that smooth ER is also you found in
a<00:01:00.070> liver

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
a liver

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.029 
a liver
it<00:01:00.820> can<00:01:01.000> help<00:01:01.230> hydrolyze<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.260> clock<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> gym

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
it can help hydrolyze a clock a gym

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.700 
it can help hydrolyze a clock a gym
which<00:01:03.219> helps<00:01:03.550> break<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:04.000> down<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.500> can<00:01:05.620> be

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
which helps break it down and it can be

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.980 
which helps break it down and it can be
used<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.010> detoxify<00:01:06.550> drugs<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.360> other<00:01:07.540> poisons

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
used to detoxify drugs and other poisons

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.690 
used to detoxify drugs and other poisons
so<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.770> would<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.100> high<00:01:09.400> concentration

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
so you would have a high concentration

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.870 
so you would have a high concentration
of<00:01:10.060> smooth<00:01:10.360> ER<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:10.900> liver<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.760> know

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
of smooth ER in your liver and you know

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.240 
of smooth ER in your liver and you know
because<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.450> do<00:01:13.630> have<00:01:13.660> high<00:01:14.230> high<00:01:14.800> amounts<00:01:15.160> of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
because you do have high high amounts of

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.390 
because you do have high high amounts of
the<00:01:15.370> yarn<00:01:15.550> in<00:01:15.790> your<00:01:15.940> liver<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:17.290> more<00:01:17.830> often

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
the yarn in your liver the more often

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.850 
the yarn in your liver the more often
that<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:18.790> breaks<00:01:19.030> down<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.330> certain<00:01:19.630> drug<00:01:20.080> that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
that it breaks down a certain drug that

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.890 
that it breaks down a certain drug that
actually<00:01:21.130> proliferate<00:01:21.940> or<00:01:22.240> increases<00:01:22.810> the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
actually proliferate or increases the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.410 
actually proliferate or increases the
amount<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.170> smooth<00:01:23.470> ER<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.860> have<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.430> this<00:01:25.240> is

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
amount of smooth ER you have and this is

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420 
amount of smooth ER you have and this is
what<00:01:25.600> gives<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.350> tolerance<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.130> certain

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
what gives you a tolerance to certain

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.850 
what gives you a tolerance to certain
drugs<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.750> more<00:01:28.930> ER<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:29.410> the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
drugs because the more ER you have the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.100 
drugs because the more ER you have the
faster<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.400> break<00:01:30.700> down<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.780> particular

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
faster you break down that particular

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.860 
faster you break down that particular
drug<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.980> you're<00:01:33.790> gonna<00:01:33.970> need<00:01:34.120> more<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.570> more

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
drug and you're gonna need more and more

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.750 
drug and you're gonna need more and more
of<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.020> drug<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.620> get<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> same<00:01:36.130> effect<00:01:36.310> and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
of that drug to get the same effect and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.150 
of that drug to get the same effect and
because<00:01:37.300> some<00:01:37.750> drugs<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.410> barbiturates<00:01:38.740> are

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
because some drugs and barbiturates are

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.790 
because some drugs and barbiturates are
so<00:01:39.580> widespread<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:41.290> mean<00:01:41.440> they're<00:01:41.530> almost<00:01:41.650> like

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
so widespread I mean they're almost like

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.540 
so widespread I mean they're almost like
the<00:01:41.980> same<00:01:42.160> type<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.550> action<00:01:43.200> becoming<00:01:44.550> having

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
the same type of action becoming having

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.070 
the same type of action becoming having
more<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:45.850> more<00:01:45.910> smooth<00:01:46.330> ER<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.630> your<00:01:46.750> system

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
more and more smooth ER in your system

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.810 
more and more smooth ER in your system
can<00:01:47.260> actually<00:01:47.440> make<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.890> immune<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.520> other

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
can actually make you immune to other

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.740

a thing called auto
which<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:51.100> when<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:52.170> cell<00:03:53.170> actually<00:03:53.590> will

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
which is when the cell actually will

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.830 
which is when the cell actually will

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
functioning properly or they may be

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.270 
functioning properly or they may be
damaged<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.570> use<00:03:59.140> those<00:03:59.290> part<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.800> recycle

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
those part works in the same way the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.229 
those part works in the same way the
lysosome<00:04:02.890> comes<00:04:03.220> up<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.580> joins<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.090> that

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
organelle that is not working properly

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.210

and<00:04:07.030> digest<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.050> those<00:04:08.350> particles<00:04:08.860> where

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and digest it and those particles where

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
those raw materials are used again now

in<00:04:12.730> vacuoles<00:04:13.420> there<00:04:13.570> are<00:04:13.660> three<00:04:13.959> types<00:04:14.200> of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
in vacuoles there are three types of

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.810 
in vacuoles there are three types of
vacuole<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:14.920> when<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.160> think<00:04:15.400> about<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.610> back

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
vacuole so when I think about the back

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.729 
vacuole so when I think about the back
you<00:04:16.000> up<00:04:16.150> simply<00:04:16.510> think<00:04:16.810> about<00:04:16.930> some<00:04:17.440> type<00:04:17.709> of

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
you up simply think about some type of

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.759 
you up simply think about some type of
realm<00:04:18.370> structure<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.419> has<00:04:19.769> something

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
realm structure that has something

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.180 
realm structure that has something
inside<00:04:21.990> the<00:04:22.990> central<00:04:23.380> vacuole<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.830> one<00:04:24.070> that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
inside the central vacuole is one that

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.680 
inside the central vacuole is one that
we<00:04:24.310> spoke<00:04:24.610> about<00:04:24.669> when<00:04:25.330> we<00:04:25.419> talked<00:04:25.570> about

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
we spoke about when we talked about

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.290 
we spoke about when we talked about
plants<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.530> animals<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.550> central<00:04:27.940> vacuole

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
plants and animals the central vacuole

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.620 
plants and animals the central vacuole
which

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
which

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.970 
which
picture<00:04:28.960> down<00:04:29.110> here<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:29.410> can<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:29.530> how<00:04:29.680> large

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
picture down here you can see how large

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.490 
picture down here you can see how large
it<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.790> central<00:04:31.480> vacuole<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.140> largest

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
it is the central vacuole is the largest

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.380 
it is the central vacuole is the largest
vacuum<00:04:32.890> inside<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.790> plant<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.300> it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
vacuum inside of the plant and it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.480 
vacuum inside of the plant and it
contains<00:04:34.720> mostly<00:04:35.140> water<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.160> can<00:04:36.280> think

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
contains mostly water and you can think

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.950 
contains mostly water and you can think
about<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:36.910> all<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.270> water<00:04:37.450> was<00:04:37.600> out<00:04:37.840> in

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
about it if all the water was out in

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960 
about it if all the water was out in
this<00:04:38.050> vacuole<00:04:38.500> these<00:04:38.710> walls<00:04:39.010> we<00:04:39.370> kind<00:04:39.580> of<00:04:39.670> seek

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
this vacuole these walls we kind of seek

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.970 
this vacuole these walls we kind of seek
inward<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:41.320> would<00:04:41.440> cause<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.740> plant

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
inward and that would cause the plant

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.700 
inward and that would cause the plant
wilt<00:04:42.370> when<00:04:43.090> these<00:04:43.180> vacuole<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.930> full<00:04:44.230> it

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
wilt when these vacuole is full it

gives<00:04:48.370> us<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.550> crispy<00:04:49.120> feeling<00:04:49.420> that's<00:04:49.540> why

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
gives us that crispy feeling that's why

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.930 
gives us that crispy feeling that's why
you<00:04:49.750> have<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.620> sprinkler<00:04:51.130> systems<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.790> lot

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
you have the sprinkler systems in a lot

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.650 
you have the sprinkler systems in a lot
of<00:04:51.970> restaurants

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
of restaurants

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.320 
of restaurants
I<00:04:52.750> mean<00:04:52.930> it's<00:04:53.020> giving<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.860> lot<00:04:54.040> of<00:04:54.330> grocery

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
I mean it's giving in a lot of grocery

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.080 
I mean it's giving in a lot of grocery
stores<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:56.410> they<00:04:56.620> fill<00:04:56.890> up<00:04:56.920> this<00:04:57.250> central

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
stores so they fill up this central

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.540 
stores so they fill up this central
vacuole<00:04:58.480> in<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.380> vegetables<00:04:59.890> in<00:05:00.100> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
vacuole in the in the vegetables in the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.340 
vacuole in the in the vegetables in the
vegetable<00:05:00.940> aisle<00:05:01.030> or<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.330> grocery<00:05:01.660> store<00:05:01.930> and

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
vegetable aisle or the grocery store and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.440 
vegetable aisle or the grocery store and
it<00:05:02.500> makes<00:05:02.650> them<00:05:02.770> look<00:05:02.920> healthy<00:05:03.460> now

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
it makes them look healthy now

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.150 
it makes them look healthy now
contractile<00:05:05.200> about<00:05:05.500> me<00:05:05.650> something<00:05:05.920> like<00:05:06.040> you

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
contractile about me something like you

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960 
contractile about me something like you
see<00:05:06.720> here<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.840> contractile<00:05:08.500> vacuole<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.850> you

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
see here a contractile vacuole that you

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.420 
see here a contractile vacuole that you
may<00:05:10.120> see<00:05:10.180> in<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:11.020> Paramecium

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
may see in a Paramecium

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.460 
may see in a Paramecium
now<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.450> kind<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.720> think<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.140> a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
now I like to kind of think of a

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.890 
now I like to kind of think of a
contractile<00:05:15.400> vacuole<00:05:16.000> kind<00:05:16.390> of<00:05:16.480> like<00:05:16.660> a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
contractile vacuole kind of like a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.370 
contractile vacuole kind of like a
bucket<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.640> know<00:05:18.640> if<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.270> was<00:05:19.390> to<00:05:19.480> go<00:05:19.600> out<00:05:19.660> on<00:05:19.960> a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
bucket you know if I was to go out on a

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.100 
bucket you know if I was to go out on a
boat<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.220> sprung<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.580> leak<00:05:21.670> as<00:05:22.120> fast<00:05:22.870> as<00:05:22.990> I

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
boat and it sprung a leak as fast as I

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.860 
boat and it sprung a leak as fast as I
could<00:05:23.170> if<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.890> could<00:05:24.070> dip<00:05:24.700> out<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.120> water<00:05:25.390> out

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
could if I could dip out the water out

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.420 
could if I could dip out the water out
of<00:05:25.930> my<00:05:26.110> boat<00:05:26.380> with<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.710> bucket

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
of my boat with that bucket

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.730 
of my boat with that bucket
the<00:05:28.360> boat<00:05:28.510> would<00:05:28.630> stay<00:05:28.810> afloat<00:05:29.110> but<00:05:29.380> if<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.650> ever

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
the boat would stay afloat but if I ever

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.230 
the boat would stay afloat but if I ever
fell<00:05:30.010> behind<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.760> boat<00:05:30.910> would<00:05:31.030> eventually

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
fell behind that boat would eventually

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.000 
fell behind that boat would eventually
seen<00:05:31.720> it's<00:05:32.200> kind<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.440> on<00:05:32.530> I<00:05:32.560> think<00:05:32.680> about

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
seen it's kind of on I think about

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.000 
seen it's kind of on I think about
central<00:05:33.400> vacuole<00:05:33.820> here<00:05:34.060> if<00:05:34.690> this<00:05:35.380> Paramecium

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
central vacuole here if this Paramecium

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.710 
central vacuole here if this Paramecium
were<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.280> be<00:05:36.400> in<00:05:36.490> freshwater<00:05:36.760> where<00:05:37.390> water

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
were to be in freshwater where water

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.780 
were to be in freshwater where water
rushed<00:05:38.110> inside<00:05:38.380> of<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:39.010> cell<00:05:39.280> from<00:05:39.430> area<00:05:39.700> of

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
rushed inside of the cell from area of

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.060 
rushed inside of the cell from area of
high<00:05:39.940> concentration<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.540> low<00:05:40.630> concentration

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
high concentration to low concentration

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.700 
high concentration to low concentration
by<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.130> few<00:05:42.460> by<00:05:42.730> osmosis<00:05:43.230> the<00:05:44.230> contractile

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
by the few by osmosis the contractile

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.260 
by the few by osmosis the contractile
vacuole<00:05:45.070> would<00:05:45.190> suck<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.670> water<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:45.970> spit

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
vacuole would suck in the water and spit

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.360 
vacuole would suck in the water and spit
it<00:05:46.450> out<00:05:46.570> as<00:05:46.840> long<00:05:47.050> as<00:05:47.140> it<00:05:47.290> can<00:05:47.410> keep<00:05:47.620> up<00:05:47.920> with<00:05:47.950> it

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
it out as long as it can keep up with it

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.150 
it out as long as it can keep up with it
coming<00:05:48.550> into<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.240> cell<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:49.960> get<00:05:50.590> rid<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.830> it

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
coming into the cell and get rid of it

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.580 
coming into the cell and get rid of it
then<00:05:51.670> that<00:05:51.730> Paramecium<00:05:52.420> is<00:05:52.480> fine<00:05:52.750> but<00:05:53.440> the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
then that Paramecium is fine but the

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.170 
then that Paramecium is fine but the
water<00:05:53.800> comes<00:05:54.070> in<00:05:54.220> at<00:05:54.340> such<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.580> high<00:05:54.790> rate<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
water comes in at such a high rate the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.970 
water comes in at such a high rate the
contractile<00:05:55.690> vacuole<00:05:56.080> can't<00:05:56.380> keep<00:05:56.500> up<00:05:56.740> the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
contractile vacuole can't keep up the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.590 
contractile vacuole can't keep up the
cell<00:05:57.190> will<00:05:57.310> eventually<00:05:57.700> swell<00:05:58.000> swell<00:05:59.190> pop<00:06:00.600> so

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
cell will eventually swell swell pop so

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.290 
cell will eventually swell swell pop so
what<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.380> would<00:06:02.560> survive<00:06:02.890> now<00:06:03.670> another<00:06:04.090> type

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
what it would survive now another type

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.000 
what it would survive now another type
of<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.570> queue<00:06:04.780> will<00:06:04.930> be<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.080> food<00:06:05.380> vacuole

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
of a queue will be a food vacuole

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.920 
of a queue will be a food vacuole
and<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.400> food<00:06:06.550> vacuole<00:06:06.910> does<00:06:07.090> exactly<00:06:07.540> what

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
and the food vacuole does exactly what

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.830 
and the food vacuole does exactly what
you<00:06:08.440> think<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.890> would<00:06:09.040> do<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.310> holds<00:06:09.700> food<00:06:09.970> all

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
you think it would do it holds food all

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.330 
you think it would do it holds food all
right<00:06:10.990> so<00:06:11.290> this<00:06:11.530> is<00:06:11.680> just<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:11.950> brief<00:06:12.160> overview

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
right so this is just a brief overview

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.180 
right so this is just a brief overview
of<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.090> endomembrane<00:06:13.630> system<00:06:13.660> I<00:06:14.500> hope<00:06:15.010> this

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
of the endomembrane system I hope this

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.610 
of the endomembrane system I hope this
helps<00:06:15.760> you<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.840> will<00:06:17.020> be<00:06:17.170> back<00:06:17.320> to<00:06:17.410> talk<00:06:17.590> to

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
helps you and I will be back to talk to

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.040 
helps you and I will be back to talk to
you<00:06:17.830> soon
