00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.580 

what<00:00:05.440> we<00:00:05.620> have<00:00:05.800> to<00:00:06.009> do<00:00:06.960> see<00:00:07.960> all<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.320> calcium

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
what we have to do see all the calcium

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.169 
what we have to do see all the calcium
all<00:00:09.129> around<00:00:09.520> there's<00:00:10.240> the<00:00:10.360> skimmer<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.969> the

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
all around there's the skimmer all the

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.710 
all around there's the skimmer all the
way<00:00:13.300> around<00:00:14.309> can't<00:00:15.309> see<00:00:15.550> much<00:00:15.670> of<00:00:15.730> that<00:00:15.910> but

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
way around can't see much of that but

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.479 
way around can't see much of that but
let's<00:00:16.930> go<00:00:19.320> planning<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.349> calcium<00:00:21.009> right<00:00:21.220> there

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:21.489 
let's go planning a calcium right there

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:32.670 
let's go planning a calcium right there
along<00:00:22.090> the<00:00:22.119> tile

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.610 

and<00:00:33.680> then<00:00:34.100> here<00:00:34.310> are<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.489> stairs<00:00:35.410> go<00:00:36.410> ahead

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
and then here are the stairs go ahead

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.330 
and then here are the stairs go ahead
and<00:00:36.739> zoom<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:37.550> can<00:00:37.790> see<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.340> calcium

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
and zoom in so you can see the calcium

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.740 
and zoom in so you can see the calcium
deposits<00:00:41.030> along<00:00:41.330> the<00:00:41.480> stairs<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:44.059> then

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
deposits along the stairs and then

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.549 
deposits along the stairs and then
there's<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.050> little<00:00:45.320> grotto<00:00:45.650> right<00:00:46.129> here<00:00:47.559> that

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
there's a little grotto right here that

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.320 
there's a little grotto right here that
we<00:00:48.739> will<00:00:49.010> zoom<00:00:49.340> out<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:52.100> zoom<00:00:52.190> back<00:00:52.610> in<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.239> you

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
we will zoom out and zoom back in so you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.220 
we will zoom out and zoom back in so you
can<00:00:53.510> see<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.640> all<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.970> calcium<00:00:56.239> built<00:00:56.780> up<00:00:57.019> on

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
can see the all the calcium built up on

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.759 
can see the all the calcium built up on
the<00:00:57.379> grotto<00:00:57.650> tile<00:00:58.160> as<00:00:58.580> well<00:00:59.410> lots<00:01:00.410> of<00:01:00.530> calcium

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
the grotto tile as well lots of calcium

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.090 
the grotto tile as well lots of calcium
three<00:01:01.250> tiles<00:01:01.460> high<00:01:05.590> alright<00:01:06.590> well<00:01:06.770> here<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:06.979> am

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
three tiles high alright well here I am

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.820 
three tiles high alright well here I am
blasting<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.630> calcium<00:01:09.140> off<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.470> swimming

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
blasting the calcium off the swimming

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.490 
blasting the calcium off the swimming
pool<00:01:09.979> tile<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.580> there<00:01:11.149> is<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.720> much<00:01:12.050> calcium

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
pool tile and there is so much calcium

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.090 
pool tile and there is so much calcium
buildup<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:14.780> was<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.259> little<00:01:15.590> nervous

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
buildup that I was a little nervous

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400 
buildup that I was a little nervous
because<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.240> didn't<00:01:17.570> want<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.780> stay<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.020> one

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
because I didn't want to stay in one

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.940 
because I didn't want to stay in one
spot<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.310> try<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.180> get<00:01:20.750> all<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.229> calcium<00:01:21.470> off

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
spot and try to get all the calcium off

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.180 
spot and try to get all the calcium off
at<00:01:22.160> once<00:01:22.430> because<00:01:22.970> when<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.390> do<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.560> tends

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
at once because when you do so it tends

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.230 
at once because when you do so it tends
to<00:01:25.399> cut<00:01:26.060> into<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:27.050> tile<00:01:27.410> itself<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.789> I'm

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
to cut into the tile itself so I'm

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.570 
to cut into the tile itself so I'm
moving<00:01:29.660> around<00:01:29.780> as<00:01:30.259> much<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.710> possibly<00:01:30.740> can

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
moving around as much as I possibly can

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.969 
moving around as much as I possibly can
and<00:01:32.570> trying<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.380> still<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.920> as<00:01:34.130> much<00:01:34.690> calcium

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
and trying to still get as much calcium

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.749 
and trying to still get as much calcium
off<00:01:36.979> as<00:01:37.580> well<00:01:37.970> as<00:01:38.409> you<00:01:39.409> can<00:01:39.560> see<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:40.130> am<00:01:40.460> wearing

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
off as well as you can see I am wearing

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.280 
off as well as you can see I am wearing
a<00:01:41.090> wetsuit<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:42.110> also<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:43.220> booties<00:01:43.700> on<00:01:43.880> it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
a wetsuit I also have booties on it's

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
a wetsuit I also have booties on it's
January<00:01:45.290> 18th<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.340> swing<00:01:46.700> pool<00:01:46.970> was

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
January 18th and the swing pool was

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.130 
January 18th and the swing pool was
definitely<00:01:47.869> not<00:01:48.189> heated<00:01:49.450> but<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.990> get

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
definitely not heated but I like to get

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.560 
definitely not heated but I like to get
inside<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.860> swimming<00:01:52.250> pool<00:01:52.549> because<00:01:53.000> that

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
inside the swimming pool because that

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.230 
inside the swimming pool because that
way<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.780> can<00:01:54.140> get<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.979> get<00:01:55.340> everything<00:01:55.430> head<00:01:56.030> on

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
way I can get the get everything head on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.679 
way I can get the get everything head on
and<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.020> seems<00:01:57.290> as<00:01:57.590> though<00:01:57.829> I<00:01:58.189> can<00:01:58.479> remove<00:01:59.479> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
and it seems as though I can remove the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.410 
and it seems as though I can remove the
calcium<00:02:00.259> much<00:02:00.890> easier<00:02:01.549> have<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> better<00:02:02.090> look

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
calcium much easier have a better look

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.990 
calcium much easier have a better look
at<00:02:02.600> everything<00:02:02.930> rather<00:02:03.860> than<00:02:04.100> trying<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.549> lean

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
at everything rather than trying to lean

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.499 
at everything rather than trying to lean
over<00:02:05.270> bend<00:02:05.869> over<00:02:06.350> get<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.549> underneath<00:02:07.909> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
over bend over get up and underneath I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.009 
over bend over get up and underneath I
just<00:02:09.500> don't<00:02:09.679> have<00:02:09.860> as<00:02:10.009> good<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.850> view<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:11.989> I

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
just don't have as good of a view so I

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.960 
just don't have as good of a view so I
always<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.620> get<00:02:12.920> inside<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.579> swimming

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
always like to get inside the swimming

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.560 
always like to get inside the swimming
pool<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.600> just<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.860> head-on<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.820> attack

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
pool and just do it head-on and attack

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.090 
pool and just do it head-on and attack
it<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.019> way<00:02:18.260> because<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.130> never<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:20.000> know

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
it that way because I never really know

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.180 
it that way because I never really know
how<00:02:22.100> good<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.640> job<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:23.299> doing<00:02:23.870> unless<00:02:24.190> I'm

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
how good of a job I'm doing unless I'm

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.190 
how good of a job I'm doing unless I'm
actually<00:02:25.519> standing<00:02:26.269> inside<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.810> swimming

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
actually standing inside the swimming

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.960 
actually standing inside the swimming
pool<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> much<00:02:28.940> better

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
pool then I have a much better

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.990 
pool then I have a much better
perspective<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:30.170> what's<00:02:30.829> happening<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
perspective of what's happening to the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:03:17.039 
perspective of what's happening to the
calcium<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.920> tile<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.610> grout<00:02:34.880> etc

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:24.670 

it<00:03:18.049> used<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.439> be<00:03:19.870> usually<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:23.680> but

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
it used to be usually just like that but

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.670 
it used to be usually just like that but
the<00:03:24.859> few<00:03:25.069> minutes<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.400> blasting<00:03:26.409> that's<00:03:27.409> all

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
the few minutes of blasting that's all

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:46.850 
the few minutes of blasting that's all
that<00:03:28.010> comes<00:03:28.220> out

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.860 

there<00:03:47.860> was<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> grotto<00:03:48.460> inside<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.510> swimming

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
there was a grotto inside the swimming

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.850 
there was a grotto inside the swimming
pool<00:03:50.140> along<00:03:50.950> with<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.610> lot<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.960> faux<00:03:53.320> rocks

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
pool along with a lot of the faux rocks

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.090 
pool along with a lot of the faux rocks
and<00:03:54.370> because<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.330> faux<00:03:55.600> rocks<00:03:56.020> there<00:03:56.890> was

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and because of the faux rocks there was

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.970 
and because of the faux rocks there was
so<00:03:57.400> much<00:03:57.670> calcium<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:59.170> were<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.680> was<00:03:59.770> being

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
so much calcium that were that was being

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.420 
so much calcium that were that was being
deposited<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:00.880> top<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.360> this<00:04:01.510> tile<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.200> was

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
deposited on top of this tile it was

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.780 
deposited on top of this tile it was
incredibly<00:04:03.430> hard<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.240> thick<00:04:04.950> as<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.430> can<00:04:06.460> see

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
incredibly hard and thick as you can see

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.250 
incredibly hard and thick as you can see
it's<00:04:06.970> kind<00:04:07.240> of<00:04:07.300> colored<00:04:07.690> it's<00:04:07.870> got<00:04:08.050> some

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
it's kind of colored it's got some

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.040 
it's kind of colored it's got some
yellow<00:04:08.680> some<00:04:08.980> brown<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.120> grout<00:04:10.480> or<00:04:10.780> not

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
yellow some brown in that grout or not

yellow some brown in that grout or not
in<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.260> grout<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.740> in<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.980> calcium<00:04:12.850> itself

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
in the grout but in the calcium itself

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.310 
in the grout but in the calcium itself
from<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.230> coloring<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.730> faux<00:04:16.090> rock<00:04:16.510> but

from the coloring of that faux rock but

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.830 
from the coloring of that faux rock but
I<00:04:17.350> there<00:04:17.980> was<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.130> couple<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.609> sections<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.359> here

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
I there was a couple of sections on here

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.720 
I there was a couple of sections on here
it's<00:04:20.019> coming<00:04:20.380> up<00:04:20.500> here<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:21.310> one<00:04:21.549> in

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
it's coming up here this one in

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.510 
it's coming up here this one in
particular<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.680> has<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.710> huge<00:04:24.430> mound<00:04:25.000> of

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
particular that has a huge mound of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.890 
particular that has a huge mound of
calcium<00:04:27.520> built<00:04:27.760> up<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.300> right<00:04:28.510> there<00:04:28.750> as

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
calcium built up and it's right there as

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.040 
calcium built up and it's right there as
I'm<00:04:29.020> shooting<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.880> took<00:04:31.150> me<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.630> long

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
I'm shooting and it just took me a long

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.180 
I'm shooting and it just took me a long
long<00:04:32.560> time<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.370> get<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.940> particular<00:04:35.190> section

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
long time to get this particular section

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.180 
long time to get this particular section
cleaned<00:04:36.820> up<00:04:37.410> again<00:04:38.410> like<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.740> said<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.040> don't

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
cleaned up again like I said I don't

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.880 
cleaned up again like I said I don't
want<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.790> stay<00:04:40.150> in<00:04:40.419> one<00:04:40.840> particular<00:04:41.560> spot

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
want to stay in one particular spot

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.180 
want to stay in one particular spot
because<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:43.000> actually<00:04:43.240> put<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.200> hole<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.919> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
because I can actually put a hole in the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.110 
because I can actually put a hole in the
tile<00:04:45.520> if<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.800> know<00:04:47.890> if<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.040> continue<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.910> stay

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
tile if you know if I continue to stay

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880 
tile if you know if I continue to stay
in<00:04:49.240> one<00:04:49.419> spot<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.960> I'm<00:04:50.020> constantly<00:04:50.470> moving

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
in one spot so I'm constantly moving

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.000 
in one spot so I'm constantly moving
around<00:04:51.600> trying<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.810> just<00:04:53.440> pressures

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
around trying to get just pressures

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.180 
around trying to get just pressures
things<00:04:54.820> like<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.870> anyway<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.800> took<00:04:56.950> me<00:04:57.100> a

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
things like that so anyway it took me a

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.719 
things like that so anyway it took me a
long<00:04:57.370> time<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:58.060> get<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.510> calcium<00:04:59.260> off<00:04:59.560> off<00:05:00.400> of

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
long time to get this calcium off off of

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.690 
long time to get this calcium off off of
the<00:05:00.910> off<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.660> tile<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.470> was<00:05:02.650> probably<00:05:03.250> at<00:05:03.640> that

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
the off the tile it was probably at that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.800 
the off the tile it was probably at that
point<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:05.440> was<00:05:05.590> probably<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.370> quarter<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.390> three

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
point it was probably a quarter to three

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.650 
point it was probably a quarter to three
eighths<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.169> an<00:05:08.320> inch<00:05:08.440> thick<00:05:09.419> but<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.510> took

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
eighths of an inch thick but it took

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.840 
eighths of an inch thick but it took
quite<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.200> long<00:05:11.440> time<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:12.010> get<00:05:12.190> all<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.580> out<00:05:12.820> of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
quite a long time to get all that out of

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:37.879 
quite a long time to get all that out of
there

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.219 

here's<00:05:38.889> an<00:05:39.069> after<00:05:39.460> shot<00:05:39.729> of<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.150> grotto<00:05:40.419> it

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
here's an after shot of the grotto it

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.409 
here's an after shot of the grotto it
certainly<00:05:41.830> took<00:05:42.069> a<00:05:42.129> long<00:05:42.430> time<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.849> get<00:05:43.240> that

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
certainly took a long time to get that

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.540 
certainly took a long time to get that
calcium<00:05:43.659> off<00:05:44.199> but<00:05:44.499> as<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:44.770> can<00:05:44.949> see<00:05:45.189> it<00:05:45.370> was

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
calcium off but as you can see it was

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.450 
calcium off but as you can see it was
definitely<00:05:46.150> well<00:05:46.389> worth<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:47.710> time<00:05:47.919> spent

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
definitely well worth the time spent

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.939 
definitely well worth the time spent
getting<00:05:48.789> all<00:05:49.689> that<00:05:49.900> calcium<00:05:50.379> off<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.979> removed

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.610 

here<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.189> a<00:05:56.219> before<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:57.000> after<00:05:57.240> shot<00:05:57.509> of<00:05:58.139> the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
here is a before and after shot of the

here is a before and after shot of the
swimming<00:05:58.889> pool<00:05:59.219> after<00:05:59.879> it<00:06:00.150> has<00:06:00.360> been<00:06:00.629> blasted

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.640 

so<00:06:05.430> if<00:06:05.580> you<00:06:05.729> have<00:06:05.909> any<00:06:06.150> calcium<00:06:06.539> built<00:06:07.259> up<00:06:07.469> on

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
so if you have any calcium built up on
