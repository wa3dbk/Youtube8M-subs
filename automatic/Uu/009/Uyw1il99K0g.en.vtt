 "Heterocyclic amines in eggs, cheese and creatine supplements?" 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.559
 More than 20 different species have been found in cooked meat, poultry and fish 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.750
 of heterocyclic amines, wherein the meat is treated under normal domestic conditions. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.680
 In order to reduce exposure to these carcinogens from heat-treated meat, 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.869
 he could of course eat vegetarian. Just don't eat meat 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.210
 for 24 hours and the levels of the two major heterocyclic amines drop to zero. 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.940
 So if you follow the meatless Monday, Tuesday morning your levels of PhIP and MeIQx would be 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.129
 (one of the strongest mutagens ever tested by researchers) 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.829
 they were no longer detectable. 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 In the case of the third heat-treated carcinogen, scientists have found some remnants 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.809
 with a few people - although they haven't eaten meat in the last 24 hours. 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.109
 That confused the researchers. 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.059
 The four people who "had a measurable amount of IQ (4.5-b) 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.490
 in urine after abstaining from meat consumption " 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.690
 (it is an isomer of a strong animal carcinogen, IQ), 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.340
 at that time they ate cheese and / or boiled eggs. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670
 However, the heat-treated meat does not. 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.510
 And several other heterocyclic amines 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.260
 they were also recorded in fried eggs, so 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.940
 "That IQ (4,5-b), which is formed at temperatures below 100 ° C, can be 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.130
 also present in boiled eggs, 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.930
 or in other foods containing creatinine, such as cheese, " 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 This gave rise to an interesting question. 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.270
 What about all these "creatine supplements, 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.180
 that sports enthusiasts use? ”Indeed, creatine changes into creatinine. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.660
 Experts think that "a high intake of creatine supplements could lead to formation." 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.350
 genotoxic heterocyclic amines in the body. " 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.480
 This alert concerns both meat consumers and vegetarians. 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.420
 Other heat-treated carcinogens when eating a vegetarian diet 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.510
 were found in a study comparing PhIP content in human hair samples. 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.910
 PhIP was found in samples of all six meat consumers tested 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.060
 and in the sample of one of the six vegetarians tested. " 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.610
 It was a small amount, barely exceeding the limit of measurability. 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.670
 That is why scientists have not taken this into account, because “PhIP exposure is primarily a problem 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.670
 through the consumption of heat-treated meat and poultry - and other than meat resources 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.590
 are probably negligible. " 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.980
 However, this does not apply if you smoke. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.620
 Remember that these carcinogens are "found in cooked meat, poultry, 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 fish and cigarette smoke. " 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.690
 Though you would observe meatless not only Monday but all week, 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.800
 Still with PhIP you can come in contact through smoke from cigarettes. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.010
 Here is a comparison of PhIP exposure 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
 meat-smokers, non-smokers consuming meat, 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.580
 smokers of vegetarians and non-smokers of vegetarians. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.829
 So it's not enough just to eat healthy.
