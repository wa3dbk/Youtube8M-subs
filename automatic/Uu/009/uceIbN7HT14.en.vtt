don't feel as bad for him for losing

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.100 
don't feel as bad for him for losing
every<00:05:44.520> single<00:05:44.910> fight<00:05:45.180> in<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:45.569> and<00:05:45.870> being

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
every single fight in this and being

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.650 
every single fight in this and being
completely<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:46.740> utterly<00:05:46.889> humiliated<00:05:47.699> then

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
completely and utterly humiliated then

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.059 
completely and utterly humiliated then
again<00:05:48.750> he<00:05:49.020> only<00:05:49.169> beat<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.470> crap<00:05:49.710> out<00:05:49.919> of<00:05:49.949> a

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
again he only beat the crap out of a

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.860 
again he only beat the crap out of a
small<00:05:50.340> child<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.180> guess<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.479> isn't<00:05:51.690> much

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
small child so I guess that isn't much

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.230 
small child so I guess that isn't much
to<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:52.020> proud<00:05:52.169> of<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.919> yet<00:05:56.639> you<00:05:56.849> failed

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
to be proud of and yet you failed

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:11.970 
to be proud of and yet you failed
repeatedly<00:06:02.030> what<00:06:03.259> well<00:06:04.430> um

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.030
