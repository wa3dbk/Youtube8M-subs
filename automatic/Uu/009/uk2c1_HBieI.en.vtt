00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
here this was about 10 taps that got

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
here this was about 10 taps that got
this<00:01:25.200> wet<00:01:25.530> layer<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.100> moist<00:01:26.310> layer<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> kind

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of collapse a little bit a continued tab

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
of collapse a little bit a continued tab
was<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.759> 11<00:01:30.090> tap<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> first

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
was actually 11 tap so it's the first

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.950 
was actually 11 tap so it's the first
tap<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> elbow<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.720> went<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
tap from the from the elbow as I went a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
tap from the from the elbow as I went a
little<00:01:34.110> harder<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> 16<00:01:35.549> taps<00:01:35.880> from<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
little harder I got to 16 taps from so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
little harder I got to 16 taps from so
16<00:01:37.710> 6<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.189> them<00:01:38.310> being<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> elbow<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
16 6 of them being from the elbow and I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
16 6 of them being from the elbow and I
got<00:01:39.240> full<00:01:39.420> propagation<00:01:40.110> across<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> slab

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
got full propagation across the slab

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.780 
got full propagation across the slab
right<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> level<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.640> does<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right at this level so what does that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.700 
right at this level so what does that
tell<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:46.140> tell<00:01:46.320> me<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.619> have

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
tell me let's tell me that we have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
tell me let's tell me that we have
stability<00:01:46.950> problems<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> I'd<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> little

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
stability problems and I'd be a little

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.990 
stability problems and I'd be a little
concerned<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.950> sluice<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.670> up

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
concerned about going into sluice or up

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.670 
concerned about going into sluice or up
in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> lid<00:01:51.479> especially<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.200> eating

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.530 

the<00:01:55.680> snow<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> starting<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.520> lose<00:01:56.820> its<00:01:57.329> ability

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the snow is starting to lose its ability

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
the snow is starting to lose its ability
to<00:01:57.869> propagate<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.500> fracture<00:01:58.950> within<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to propagate a fracture within the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
in shallower snow I wasn't I would not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.310 
in shallower snow I wasn't I would not
have<00:02:06.000> been<00:02:06.180> able<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> propagation<00:02:06.990> like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
have been able to get a propagation like

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
have been able to get a propagation like
this<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.250> places<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.849> deeper<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
and you still have this week later right

in there this instability so essentially

surface but what it's going to do is

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
surface but what it's going to do is
it's<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.660> remove<00:02:34.960> some<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
it's going to remove some of the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.900 
it's going to remove some of the
strength<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:35.920> upper<00:02:36.250> snow<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.640> make<00:02:36.790> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
strength of this upper snow and make it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.790 
strength of this upper snow and make it
easier<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.570> your<00:02:37.690> impact<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.230> go<00:02:38.350> down<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
easier for your impact to go down to

you<00:02:43.420> might<00:02:43.570> propagate<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.110> fracture<00:02:44.530> out<00:02:44.820> and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
you might propagate a fracture out and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.220 
you might propagate a fracture out and
in<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.060> back<00:02:46.210> of<00:02:46.360> my<00:02:46.450> mind<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.810> rated<00:02:46.990> things

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
in the back of my mind I rated things

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.600 
in the back of my mind I rated things
moderate<00:02:47.620> today<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:48.100> also<00:02:48.280> thinking

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
moderate today but I'm also thinking

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.850 
moderate today but I'm also thinking
with<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.030> intense<00:02:49.450> sunlight<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.590> wouldn't

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
with this intense sunlight it wouldn't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.470 
with this intense sunlight it wouldn't
surprise<00:02:50.920> me<00:02:51.190> at<00:02:51.460> all<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.730> see<00:02:51.850> some<00:02:52.030> wet<00:02:52.180> slabs

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
surprise me at all to see some wet slabs

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
surprise me at all to see some wet slabs
naturally<00:02:53.050> release<00:02:53.320> from<00:02:53.530> these<00:02:53.650> areas<00:02:54.040> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
naturally release from these areas so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.160 
naturally release from these areas so
you<00:02:55.180> know<00:02:55.270> I'm<00:02:55.360> kind<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.630> questioning<00:02:55.750> whether

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
you know I'm kind of questioning whether

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.230 
you know I'm kind of questioning whether
i<00:02:56.260> should<00:02:56.350> have<00:02:56.530> rated<00:02:57.040> them<00:02:57.160> considerable<00:02:58.090> or

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
i should have rated them considerable or

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.170 
i should have rated them considerable or
not<00:02:59.220> you<00:03:00.220> know<00:03:00.280> i<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.580> if<00:03:00.670> i<00:03:00.790> know<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.030> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
not you know i think if i know in the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.880 
not you know i think if i know in the
forecast<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:02.380> intense

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
forecast is going to be for intense

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.380 
forecast is going to be for intense
sunshine<00:03:03.430> I'd<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:03.730> probably<00:03:03.850> gone<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.360> a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
sunshine I'd have probably gone with a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.630 
sunshine I'd have probably gone with a
considerable<00:03:04.870> rating<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.490> good

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
considerable rating so this is a good

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520 
considerable rating so this is a good
reminder<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.300> always<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.840> your<00:03:07.960> own<00:03:08.080> stability

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
reminder to always do your own stability

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.870 
reminder to always do your own stability
assessments<00:03:08.980> when<00:03:09.100> you're<00:03:09.220> going<00:03:09.340> into<00:03:09.550> train

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
assessments when you're going into train

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.080 
assessments when you're going into train
and<00:03:11.130> play<00:03:12.130> conservative<00:03:12.730> there's<00:03:12.880> good

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
and play conservative there's good

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.730 
and play conservative there's good
