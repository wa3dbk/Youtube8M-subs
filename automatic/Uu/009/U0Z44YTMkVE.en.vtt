it<00:01:12.859> up<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.749> decide<00:01:14.749> if<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:15.229> is<00:01:15.289> what

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
it up to you to decide if this is what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.760 
it up to you to decide if this is what
you<00:01:16.369> want<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.359> think<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.749> if<00:01:17.869> some<00:01:18.350> people<00:01:18.499> are

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
you want I think that if some people are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.179 
you want I think that if some people are
pool<00:01:19.069> people<00:01:20.109> and<00:01:21.109> if<00:01:21.350> you're<00:01:21.469> a<00:01:21.499> food<00:01:21.740> person

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
pool people and if you're a food person

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.959 
pool people and if you're a food person
I<00:01:22.280> guess<00:01:22.490> what<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.789> want<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.329> a<00:01:23.359> tropical<00:01:23.770> feel

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
I guess what you want is a tropical feel

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.050 
I guess what you want is a tropical feel
large<00:01:25.969> pool<00:01:26.929> area<00:01:27.459> ideally<00:01:28.459> that<00:01:28.609> doesn't<00:01:28.939> get

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
large pool area ideally that doesn't get

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.879 
large pool area ideally that doesn't get
very<00:01:29.090> overcrowded<00:01:29.659> well<00:01:30.139> forget<00:01:30.560> about<00:01:30.649> that

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889 
very overcrowded well forget about that

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:32.260 
very overcrowded well forget about that

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.019 
are but if you're looking for a relaxing
pool<00:01:38.149> area<00:01:38.630> what<00:01:39.259> am<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.439> say<00:01:39.649> relax<00:01:40.069> yeah<00:01:40.520> pool

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.029 
pool area what am I say relax yeah pool

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.089 
pool area what am I say relax yeah pool
area<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.689> would<00:01:42.079> say<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.709> isn't<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
area I would say that this isn't the

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.249 
area I would say that this isn't the
edge<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.700> mean<00:01:43.999> actually<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:44.659> deceptively

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
edge I mean actually it's deceptively

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.069 
edge I mean actually it's deceptively
large<00:01:45.380> because<00:01:46.039> it's<00:01:46.249> got<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.700> strange

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
large because it's got this strange

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.139 
large because it's got this strange
shape

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.670 

I<00:01:50.209> think<00:01:50.719> it's<00:01:50.840> larger<00:01:51.229> than<00:01:51.409> one<00:01:51.649> feels

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
I think it's larger than one feels

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.530 
I think it's larger than one feels
and<00:01:54.250> you've<00:01:54.430> got<00:01:54.640> by<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.910> way<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.330> roller

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and you've got by the way the roller

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.670 
and you've got by the way the roller
coaster<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.600> you'll<00:01:58.750> always<00:01:58.930> have<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.500> roller

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
coaster so you'll always have the roller

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.240 
coaster so you'll always have the roller
coaster<00:02:00.160> on<00:02:00.280> top<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.530> know<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.950> I'm<00:02:03.040> gonna
