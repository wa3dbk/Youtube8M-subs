00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 the first bivouac of the docker 2014 will 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.760
 Logically it is 8 o'clock locally 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 we have just heard that we are from 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 Ginkel has become tenth on the first 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.790
 stage a fantastic achievement 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 you will see at the end of this journal 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.449
 his first reaction but first what was 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.449
 exactly the route of today 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.840
 we had to wait longer for them 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.510
 The first day there I was on a long 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.500
 frees up 800 km every day for one km 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.110
 total 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.479
 and 180 km special with 10,000 turns 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.710
 so I think how to get your studies straight away 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.510
 take me think the berlin 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.940
 yes it takes a while to stop yes we have 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.780
 when is no stitches and yes we 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.640
 also have take here and the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.860
 passed by who was messing around 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.890
 so yes that worked perfectly actually 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240
 new x 22 22 is great 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.380
 who is great yes yes it is still 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.210
 just get used to it I must honestly say it 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.350
 is still your 8 certain 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.630
 are what make them different or loyal 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.479
 caterpillar of course or our douwe 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 x 22 22 let me say it so that is 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.160
 get used but it quickly went no 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.840
 ten place 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.940
 I think exactly found expectation 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.110
 what you wanted yes beyond expectations 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.060
 had actually said to myself now 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.320
 on top 15 is tevree today what 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.550
 is of course yes 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.530
 when you see what material trade 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.630
 state and how big the competition is 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.910
 then if I have been happy they put it at 15 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.820
 March is at 10 and they are better than expected 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.289
 tomorrow I hope again top 10 and the but 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.830
 So the best weather is number 10 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.830
 fine 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.890
 and you would start off nicely I think 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.790
 went fine 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.810
 much along well i have an oil churchill 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.450
 her 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.320
 the is 20 can stay than I have but go 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.590
 almost not driven 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.850
 so completely new and moderation and hair 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.920
 I also have a new boy's hair 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.640
 yet array to what doesn't giggle hair 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.170
 mirror 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 do you feel the pressure from behind so me 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.480
 you back a bit more 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.610
 watching what comes clear clear 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.100
 3 or are you really focused ahead 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.260
 understanding you have a 2 about him 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.300
 let ask yes yes who was out of him 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.620
 I think now all go and then just 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.380
 also we calmly start job things 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.690
 nothing for you and nothing for me 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.630

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.590

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.150

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.740
 bit notorious for carrying 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.120
 who threw everything starts out but that 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.290
