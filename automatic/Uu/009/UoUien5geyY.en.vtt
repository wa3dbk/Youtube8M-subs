later<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.159> nez<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.939> again<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:36.270> did<00:01:36.420> come<00:01:36.569> out

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
later or nez then again it did come out

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.389 
later or nez then again it did come out
in<00:01:36.749> 1990<00:01:37.289> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.499> don't<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> why<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> graphics

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
in 1990 so I don't know why the graphics

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.410 
in 1990 so I don't know why the graphics
wouldn't<00:01:38.700> look<00:01:38.789> this<00:01:38.969> good

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
wouldn't look this good

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.029 
wouldn't look this good
I<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.170> tried<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.530> recreate<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
I like how they tried to recreate the

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.190 
I like how they tried to recreate the
whole<00:01:41.159> washed-out<00:01:41.939> desert<00:01:42.389> post-apocalyptic

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
whole washed-out desert post-apocalyptic

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.989 
whole washed-out desert post-apocalyptic
look<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> film's<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.520> looks<00:01:44.729> pretty

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
look of the film's that looks pretty

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.940 
look of the film's that looks pretty
good<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.780> problem<00:01:45.950> for

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
good but there's just one problem for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
good but there's just one problem for
when<00:01:47.039> I've<00:01:47.159> played<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.670> game<00:01:47.850> there's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
when I've played at this game there's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
when I've played at this game there's
only<00:01:48.210> three<00:01:48.479> types<00:01:48.719> of<00:01:48.869> levels<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.469> driving

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
only three types of levels the driving

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
only three types of levels the driving
levels<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> desert<00:01:50.999> the<00:01:51.299> mines<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:51.959> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
levels in the desert the mines and the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.169 
levels in the desert the mines and the
arena<00:01:52.380> levels<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:53.999> is

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
arena levels and all the game does is

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.969 
arena levels and all the game does is
either<00:01:54.299> palette<00:01:54.810> swap<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> desert<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.829> in

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
either palette swap the desert like in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
either palette swap the desert like in
the<00:01:56.069> second<00:01:56.429> level<00:01:56.609> or<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.509> changes

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the second level or it just changes

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.599 
the second level or it just changes
around<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.319> design<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.859> mine<00:01:59.039> levels<00:01:59.399> so

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
around a design of the mine levels so

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.919 
around a design of the mine levels so
the<00:01:59.729> graphics<00:02:00.090> become<00:02:00.389> very<00:02:00.630> repetitive

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
the graphics become very repetitive

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.199 
the graphics become very repetitive
after<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.530> while<00:02:01.740> where<00:02:02.490> she<00:02:02.729> had<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.969> sameness

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
after a while where she had the sameness

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.429 
after a while where she had the sameness
of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.539> graphics<00:02:03.959> makes<00:02:04.139> it<00:02:04.289> almost

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
of the graphics makes it almost

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.019 
of the graphics makes it almost
impossible<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.219> tell<00:02:05.399> where<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> fuck<00:02:05.880> you're

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
impossible to tell where the fuck you're

impossible to tell where the fuck you're
going<00:02:06.060> much<00:02:06.569> less<00:02:06.749> where<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.049> fuck<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.409> are

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439

what<00:02:57.240> happens<00:02:57.570> when<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> gas<00:02:57.960> runs<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
what happens when the gas runs out you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.190 
what happens when the gas runs out you
lose<00:02:59.220> now<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.360> buy<00:03:00.510> gas<00:03:00.810> there<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
lose now you can buy gas there at the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.810 
lose now you can buy gas there at the
beginning<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.680> level<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.520> how<00:03:02.670> would

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
beginning this level but then how would

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.340 
beginning this level but then how would
the<00:03:02.910> game<00:03:03.090> designers<00:03:03.540> ever<00:03:03.750> expect<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the game designers ever expect you to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.450 
the game designers ever expect you to
know<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.530> right<00:03:04.950> off<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> bat

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
know that right off the bat

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.400 
know that right off the bat
so<00:03:06.150> essentially<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.140> fail

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
so essentially you just have to fail

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.170 
so essentially you just have to fail
about<00:03:07.650> 50<00:03:07.980> times<00:03:08.190> or<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.550> before<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.910> figure

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
about 50 times or so before you figure

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.790 
about 50 times or so before you figure
out<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.510> have<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.810> buy<00:03:09.930> gasoline<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.650> get

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
out that you have to buy gasoline to get

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920 
out that you have to buy gasoline to get
where<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.010> need<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.910> even<00:03:12.540> worse<00:03:12.750> when

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
where you need to go and even worse when

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
where you need to go and even worse when
you<00:03:13.110> start<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> arena<00:03:13.830> level<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.340> get<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.490> full

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
you start the arena level you get a full

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 
you start the arena level you get a full
tank<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.150> gas<00:03:15.210> no<00:03:15.630> matter<00:03:15.660> how<00:03:15.960> little<00:03:16.140> gas<00:03:16.440> you

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
tank of gas no matter how little gas you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.960 
tank of gas no matter how little gas you
had<00:03:16.800> left<00:03:17.070> when<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.310> got<00:03:17.490> there

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
had left when you got there

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.730 
had left when you got there
so<00:03:18.330> why<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.630> fuck<00:03:19.020> can't<00:03:19.050> they<00:03:19.440> give<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.710> a

so why the fuck can't they give you a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.470 
so why the fuck can't they give you a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
full tank of gas in the beginning of the
