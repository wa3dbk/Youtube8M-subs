00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.580
 origami trait we make it turn the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.830
 bullet we still see a shot and the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.849
 let's look from below this is really a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 Fun and easy origami as it is 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 realizes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.910
 the origami all right let's start from a while 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 of god of paper in this case we have 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.430
 took the 7x7 measure anyway a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 small piece of square paper 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.970
 we take the cardboard sheet we put 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.180
 so with the tip towards us we go 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.460
 down and fold the sheet of paper like this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 in half 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 having done this we take this side and it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 we report on the center so let's go here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 we give it so we go over and trace 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.149
 this perfect line 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.699
 did this we found this 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.910
 point how now we see here is one way 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.010
 this point will touch the point 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.530
 which we found then with the tip 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.350
 let's go here and trace this line 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 well now we have a double here 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.049
 single leaflet lo leaf lo 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.299
 we pull down and leave it bent like this 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.710
 below 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.619
 this is the simple embroidery you need 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 do to make our top in it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 we need seven a total of 7 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.259
 or gifts we see how they are assembled 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.509
 these components let's go to the first e 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.360
 we see that there is a kind of task et in 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.600
 water inside we have the second one 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.220
 same verse 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.040
 let's go into the interiors in 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.280
 so that here they touch each other 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.159
 exactly where ours will be with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 having done this we are going to fall back towards 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.909
 the outside 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.700
 this little triangle called this one 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.770
 we take it back so now we try to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.299
 alternating colors we asked for it 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.229
 let us put assistants komodo degli 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.750
 others 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.850
 we do not aim so in such a way that 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.759
 they end up being exactly in the middle 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.920
 this triangles sides advances it 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:19.209
 we bend like this and this one folds back 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.440
 inside in this world it becomes loose 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.440
 the same thing 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.420
 Yup 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.730
 we let him go under this 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.290
 point we make 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 blue a good we go so in a manner 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.129
 such that the tip 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.980
 we study to end up right towards 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.210
 the center this triangle it 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 let us pray this triangle back 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:53.100
 we fold it like this and make it disappear 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.340
 the whole though at this point of this 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.340
 color 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.290
 ok this little triangle here 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.630
 we are behind this triangle here it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.900
 let's put it this way 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.360
 to say I love you 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.490
 then 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.480
 first let's get important to find 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.950
 own 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 center ok this triangle will go 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430
 behind 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.730
 this triangle instead 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.129
 we see so it is the last double triangles 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.129
 encloses ours too 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.880
 here 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.580
 this little triangle they call it 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.950
 behind this point we do not give it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.950
 the angle to our negotiation 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.080
 so 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.920
 we are 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.920
 Yup 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.060
 we give you the angle 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.490
 and at this point this 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.490
 cannot be explained 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.440
 get it going 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.440
 they beat all the triangles well 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.960
 see below 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.430
 over it 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.880
 we do it 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.880
 vote
