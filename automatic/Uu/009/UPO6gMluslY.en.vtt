those big one they will hurt you and I
don't<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.180> they<00:01:43.300> drop<00:01:43.510> anything<00:01:43.750> at<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
don't and they drop anything at the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.310 
don't and they drop anything at the
moment<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:47.130> can't<00:01:48.130> kill<00:01:48.310> them<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
moment and you can't kill them so the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.590 
moment and you can't kill them so the
next<00:01:50.350> thing<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.580> case<00:01:51.940> file<00:01:52.210> which<00:01:52.450> is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
next thing is the case file which is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.390 
next thing is the case file which is
quite<00:01:52.900> cool<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.620> because<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.860> poisons

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
here and you just hit it and then it

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.210 
here and you just hit it and then it
will<00:01:58.810> attack<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.290> then<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.560> get<00:01:59.740> poisoned

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220
