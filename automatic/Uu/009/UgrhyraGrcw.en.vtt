00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 politicians because we are in the facilities of the hotel school 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.660
 new salamanca the interface I wore is festive sacks nobody have put on when 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.660
 this arrangement the facilities with which it exploits the butt 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 this morning to the headquarters of the hospitality school and we will not put all the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 with the recipe 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130
 We are going to make an Iberian ham clamp with 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.899
 with children 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.299
 We're not finishing the season and you and I think it's a good time to 

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:30.989
 take advantage of the Arabs too 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.200
 carlitos 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.230
 i put for more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.610
 we are going to need 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 the 110 grams of flour 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.300
 it makes possible strength although well we are not going to put too much Taliban 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 18 grams of yeast although we can not lower it a little if we have time to 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.720
 so that the mass rest and other 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.340
 40 grams of its durum marina, but then if I explain a little 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.400
 120 125 grams of water 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.180
 a little bit of sugar a little bit of salt so that it costs us and then we're not going to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.440
 use a little bit of what would be more noticeable to deliver them with 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.300
 presented 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.670
 the first Latin i there is a lot of trujillo in this world there are people using yeast 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 dry of people who will use yeast to seven times the rate zero 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350
 we have not talked more with more stories 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.990
 so we put together 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.350
 all in the durum wheat semolina that is what I said that for 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.149
 he the conscious touch as long as we run to the top 125 grams of water 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 it's a little sugar 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.670
 the touch of salt 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.260
 and you have to start 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.439
 to place 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.280
 not worth 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.030
 that's why I think that with more or less 4 5 minutes we have more than enough 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.240
 amount of oil 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.180
 well, about 20 grams for these types of pieces that come out 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 stopped three people in this case we will use a 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.390
 an olive oil of jaén an extra virgin fidelity must be explained to load 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.690
 a little bit this theme the pack 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.060
 that its waters 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.220
 more or less 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.920
 Well, the 20 granites are like two tablespoons two tablespoons heat 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.970
 we see that the most the follow down and then we are going to take a little 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 the dough bring out the table will work medium co 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.969
 easily 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.129
 we have the club the bag out we have in flour a little bit the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.079
 to the surface and so it touches us the locals won by beating issue of 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.539
 more or less 2 3 minutes giving you here 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.429
 just perfectly 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.979
 I feel the last car that cited oil 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.679
 we have already perfectly 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.629
 worked with which we return it to the premises 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.939
 the will or place in it in the mondra we had we can advance another 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.079
 and we are waiting for the feet to alienate a little there was good dynamics 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.629
 ojú offer a little bit with 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.659
 I knew theory but then we can not take off precisely 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.539
 so we cover 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.619
 we travel for about 50 minutes 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.849
 As we are in winter it will be more than enough after choosing account 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.869
 minute of rest one hour or so 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.189
 we have the line the prepared dough and as you see 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.249
 if it took us to appreciate but let's 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.359
 in the mass has risen to citizenship 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.549
 let's do a bit of tila de adame campaign maybe for a while now 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.719
 google the roll and we take it out carefully the captain of the air and the 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.379
 face bag 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.430
 and slowly remove the air bubbles 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.919
 we offer a flours meal and from that moment we already started to 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.839
 handle it 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.549
 the march of saleh to me I have never liked the round tables with which 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.839
 we are part of him 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.560
 the 3 14 there and we're going to the mass 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.549
 the formation 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.110
 hahahaha that after all the side of me filling this case is going to be a 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.269
 little of 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.269
 of homemade fried tomato that a little bit to the cows 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.219
 the semi-cured cheese we had bought 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.349
 i have here the Iberian ham that in this case you can see 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.699
 how two vague no temperatures welcome and this starts in that city 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.819
 I follow him civil and the dumbbell cupola that I do because we're going to have to 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.320
 deliver the third so much to the end the card already perfectly explained 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.499
 so 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.190
 to the tray we touched a tad with your fingers 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.559
 and we started laughing 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.479
 the subject is a tomato sauce no less mythical possible is worth it because if not no what 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.709
 soften the base of the pint that is going to be a little sandwich or little idea is 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.519
 say without water 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.090
 We distribute the cheese too, which is going to be a little bit the same 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.639
 we face saab the market will have 150 grams but maybe 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.819
 a little bit too much the same time handed out dishonorable by the children that 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.199
 is another important ingredient in this case 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.199
 we have taken them matures with which we assure ourselves a little the uncle of whom 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.389
 see that he is going to characterize the record and that he is going to leave it with a 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.620
 with a somewhat texture 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.870
 flew cia of that you know the cut of the period is practically saying 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.419
 kome min is not a matter of days I used to have him with three children 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.539
 have the chips more than more than enough 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.469
 and we started to place the can 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.460
 covered in ascending order by this 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.170
 we have to level the problem nobody if we do not have much more we will not go to the oven 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.339
 with it at 250 degrees so that the most accused 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.319
 so that the ones that we have met people and then inside even though I was born 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.499
 I touch that soft touch 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.740
 i about eight minutes 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.339
 in this case they are eight 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.889
 it depends on him hanging busts ovens can be a little more a little less we 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.329
 we put the appointment 50 degrees eight minutes and we forgot about Jabalia meanwhile 

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.610
 we prepare ham we are preparing the other pole of the ibo 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.819
 the hand is already had well hyundai has seen for inside famous aol tim to the 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.960
 last details of the day simply ham 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.270
 but the seriousness and ordered become serious i and so far has not said 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.270
 territory with views 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.289
 we put antonio bouquets a little bit 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.460
 and much better now 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.710
 what the children were going to 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.050
 yes a little mint to cool off 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.979
 and Iberian ham that they will make when we put them on the board to start 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.590
 sweat like god chan jamón ibérico can never be told what 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.330
 which one 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.689
 we have it 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.189
 and nothing as soon as a pizza was put together for them pelotari glove before these 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.919
 things always safety is important 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.239
 and now for outside people go sincelejo 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.119
 I do not control that 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.729
 and we have to whom at first a first function of the date is worth we come with the 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.099
 pitahaya 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.550
 in 2001 unfortunately they do a little bit of 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.960
 Peter Jackson 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.539
 with Iberian ham 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.909
 is going to add up there are alarming I think they did not show Diego Lopez 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.449
 producers 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.099
 we distribute Iberian ham 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.559
 we place especially if hands equal is worth to contrast we will use some 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:52.719
 bitter touches of arugula for masters to help us a little bit 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.339
 local especially for 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.339
 to also talk with the subject with the theme from which we started 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.169
 and already as a pure personal vice 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.479
 a few leaves of regret, although for this I think that nothing a little 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.189
 decade but good 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.529
 from that list do not like disarmament 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.939
 and Taliban we are all 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.399
 Follow in case we give you a little slice for who to see 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.999
 how bad 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.209
 as the subject i is true the license I am not going to get a goal 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:31.149
 the two couples 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.240
 amazing 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.389
 short camera of I got myself I grew up
