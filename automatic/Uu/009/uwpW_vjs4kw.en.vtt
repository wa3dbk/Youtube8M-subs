today<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.260> are<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.560> review<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.270> 360

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
today we are going to review the 360

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.010 
today we are going to review the 360
watt<00:00:03.449> LED<00:00:03.870> spotlights<00:00:04.680> with<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.390> six<00:00:06.390> LEDs<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
watt LED spotlights with the six LEDs of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.379 
watt LED spotlights with the six LEDs of
10<00:00:07.470> watts<00:00:07.710> each<00:00:07.890> two<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.550> them<00:00:08.790> are<00:00:09.030> in<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
10 watts each two of them are in the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.450 
10 watts each two of them are in the
flood<00:00:09.840> configuration<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.679> four<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.099> them<00:00:11.309> are

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
flood configuration and four of them are

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.930 
flood configuration and four of them are
on<00:00:11.580> spot<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.940> not

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
on spot so as you can see it's not

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
on spot so as you can see it's not
really<00:00:15.210> very<00:00:15.240> good<00:00:15.660> weather<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.289> out

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
really very good weather to be out

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
really very good weather to be out
testing<00:00:16.890> lights<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> could<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.480> beam

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
testing lights but I could get some beam

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.170 
testing lights but I could get some beam
shots<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.320> theater<00:00:19.859> weather<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.550> empty<00:00:21.029> road

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
shots in theater weather or empty road

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
shots in theater weather or empty road
for<00:00:21.960> no<00:00:22.170> video<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:23.820> do

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
for no video I think you have to make do

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.370 
for no video I think you have to make do
with<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.269> snow<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> everything

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
with the snow and everything

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
with the snow and everything
so<00:00:25.830> first<00:00:26.039> let's<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> lights<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.330> are

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so first let's get to the lights we are

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.349 
so first let's get to the lights we are
viewing<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> main

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
viewing as you can see this is the main

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780 
viewing as you can see this is the main
headlamp<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.109> has<00:00:31.230> 60<00:00:31.619> watts<00:00:31.859> Osram<00:00:32.460> silver

again<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.190> 60<00:00:35.880> watts<00:00:36.090> 55<00:00:36.899> 60<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> be

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
again this is 60 watts 55 60 to be

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
again this is 60 watts 55 60 to be
precise<00:00:37.920> both<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.120> headlamps<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.079> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
precise both these headlamps are now in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010 
precise both these headlamps are now in
high<00:00:40.440> beam<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> light<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.270> question<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
high beam but the light in question is a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.270 
high beam but the light in question is a
single<00:00:43.559> piece<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.320> 360<00:00:46.320> watt<00:00:46.500> LED<00:00:46.890> system

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
single piece of the 360 watt LED system

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
single piece of the 360 watt LED system
it<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.820> 10<00:00:48.090> watt<00:00:48.300> 3<00:00:48.539> LEDs<00:00:48.930> instead<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it is 10 watt 3 LEDs instead of the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.150 
it is 10 watt 3 LEDs instead of the
common<00:00:50.370> 3<00:00:50.579> watt<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> 6<00:00:51.750> LEDs<00:00:52.199> means<00:00:52.469> total<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
common 3 watt and 6 LEDs means total of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.970 
common 3 watt and 6 LEDs means total of
60<00:00:53.520> watts<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.690> mentioned<00:00:55.050> earlier<00:00:55.379> four<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
60 watts as I mentioned earlier four of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
60 watts as I mentioned earlier four of
them<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.430> spot<00:00:56.730> configuration<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> two

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
them are in spot configuration and two

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
them are in spot configuration and two
of<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.500> flood<00:00:58.770> configuration<00:00:59.449> these

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
of them are in flood configuration these

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
of them are in flood configuration these
are<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.840> fairly<00:01:01.530> low<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> look<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
are in fairly low and if you look at the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
are in fairly low and if you look at the
beam<00:01:05.580> spread<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> beam<00:01:06.659> pattern<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> see

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
beam spread and beam pattern you can see

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.240 
beam spread and beam pattern you can see
that<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.150> outshine<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.890> halogens<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that they outshine the halogens by a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.730 
that they outshine the halogens by a
large<00:01:11.520> margin<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> single<00:01:12.900> lamp

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
large margin so it's just a single lamp

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.030 
large margin so it's just a single lamp
and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.450> aim<00:01:15.630> low<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> road<00:01:16.560> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and I have them aim low at the road for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
and I have them aim low at the road for
off-road<00:01:17.640> conditions<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.240> always<00:01:18.540> better

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
off-road conditions it's always better

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.050 
off-road conditions it's always better
to<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.170> lights<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.770> row<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to have a lights in row because then you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
to have a lights in row because then you
can<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> sides<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.500> what's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can see the sides as well as what's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
can see the sides as well as what's
right<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.549> front<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.090> vehicle<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> let's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
right in front of your vehicle so let's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.789 
right in front of your vehicle so let's
now<00:01:26.009> test<00:01:26.070> them<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:27.000> by<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.259> okay<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.650> are

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
now test them one by one okay now we are

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.819 
now test them one by one okay now we are
on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> low<00:01:29.369> beam<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.990> we<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.560> switch<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
on the low beam and we will switch to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.490 
on the low beam and we will switch to
the<00:01:32.070> high<00:01:32.369> beam<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> beam

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the high beam and see what is the beam

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.609 
the high beam and see what is the beam
pattern<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> stock<00:01:35.340> halogen<00:01:35.579> high<00:01:36.000> beam

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
pattern of the stock halogen high beam

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.780 
pattern of the stock halogen high beam
okay<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> high<00:01:38.549> beam

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
okay here we are in the high beam

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
okay here we are in the high beam
configuration<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.070> range

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
configuration as you can see the range

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.300 
configuration as you can see the range
of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> light<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.270> good<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> visibility

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
of the light is good but the visibility

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
of the light is good but the visibility
at<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> end<00:01:44.729> leaves<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.479> desired

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
at the end leaves a lot to be desired

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.280 
at the end leaves a lot to be desired
now<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> comparison<00:01:48.720> let's<00:01:49.020> just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
now in to do a comparison let's just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
now in to do a comparison let's just
switch<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.890> Cree<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:51.090> along<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
switch on the Cree also along with the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.399 
switch on the Cree also along with the
high<00:01:51.780> beam<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.869> brightness

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
high beam here you go the brightness

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.550 
high beam here you go the brightness
level<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> Cree<00:01:56.369> totally<00:01:57.329> outshines<00:01:58.079> both

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
level of the Cree totally outshines both

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.789 
level of the Cree totally outshines both
the<00:01:58.890> halogens<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.579> high<00:01:59.909> beam<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the halogens on high beam and this is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.690 
the halogens on high beam and this is
just<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> single<00:02:02.610> 60<00:02:03.119> volt<00:02:03.360> cree<00:02:03.719> LED<00:02:04.110> bar<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
just a single 60 volt cree LED bar so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.800 
just a single 60 volt cree LED bar so
many<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.299> go<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> 3<00:02:07.259> watt<00:02:07.469> bar<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
many people go for the 3 watt bar and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.040 
many people go for the 3 watt bar and
fit<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.959> lamps<00:02:10.619> which<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.310> approximately<00:02:12.150> 20

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
fit in lamps which have approximately 20

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
fit in lamps which have approximately 20
LED

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
LED

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.550 
LED
fifteen<00:02:14.460> LEDs<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> output<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.870> same<00:02:16.230> but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
fifteen LEDs so the output is same but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.400 
fifteen LEDs so the output is same but
the<00:02:17.550> thing<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.790> when<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.209> have<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> 3<00:02:18.900> watt<00:02:19.110> bar

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the thing is when you have a 3 watt bar

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.970 
the thing is when you have a 3 watt bar
or<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.950> 5<00:02:20.400> watt<00:02:20.640> epi<00:02:21.330> star<00:02:21.600> bar<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.530> range<00:02:22.800> of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
or a 5 watt epi star bar the range of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.490 
or a 5 watt epi star bar the range of
the<00:02:23.100> light<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.459> very<00:02:23.580> limited<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.540> 10<00:02:25.230> watt

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the light is very limited so a 10 watt

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
the light is very limited so a 10 watt
bar<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.130> very<00:02:26.430> good<00:02:26.700> because<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> are

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
bar is very good because if you are

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.949 
bar is very good because if you are
going<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.319> long<00:02:28.650> range<00:02:29.040> rather<00:02:29.730> than<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> low

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
going for a long range rather than a low

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.010 
going for a long range rather than a low
flood<00:02:31.590> kind<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.160> configuration<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:33.120> 10<00:02:33.810> watt

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
flood kind of configuration a 10 watt
LEDs<00:02:34.560> always<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.190> best<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.000> has

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
LEDs always the best and this one has

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.020 
LEDs always the best and this one has
six<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.660> those<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.620> see<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.160> result

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.880 

here<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> three<00:02:43.080> LEDs<00:02:43.560> in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
here we have the three LEDs in

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.610 
here we have the three LEDs in
conjunction<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> low<00:02:45.330> beam<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.840> just

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
conjunction with the low beam I just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.640 
conjunction with the low beam I just
switch<00:02:47.370> off<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.910> low<00:02:48.660> beam<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.470> keep

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
switch off the low beam now just keep

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.710 
switch off the low beam now just keep
the<00:02:49.830> trees<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.670> Leslie<00:02:51.239> doesn't<00:02:51.450> make<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the trees on and Leslie doesn't make a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.620 
the trees on and Leslie doesn't make a
difference<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:53.010> much<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:54.180> they're

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
difference not much I think they're

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.440 
difference not much I think they're
pretty<00:02:54.870> much<00:02:55.550> outshine<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.760> low<00:02:56.940> beam<00:02:57.209> by<00:02:57.420> a

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
pretty much outshine the low beam by a

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.690 
pretty much outshine the low beam by a
large<00:02:57.780> margin<00:02:58.080> since<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.280> been<00:02:59.310> aimed

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
large margin since they have been aimed

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.930 
large margin since they have been aimed
low<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> still<00:03:00.600> need<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> high<00:03:01.260> beam<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.940> show

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
low you still need the high beam to show

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.420 
low you still need the high beam to show
you<00:03:03.000> rumination<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> far<00:03:04.200> end<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.130> if<00:03:05.310> you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you rumination at the far end but if you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.370 
you rumination at the far end but if you
aim<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> bit<00:03:06.300> higher<00:03:06.540> or<00:03:06.810> if<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.140> position

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
aim them a bit higher or if you position

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.920 
aim them a bit higher or if you position
them<00:03:07.680> bit<00:03:07.950> higher<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.459> vehicle<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.720> can

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
them bit higher on your vehicle you can

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.040 
them bit higher on your vehicle you can
actually<00:03:10.110> not<00:03:10.739> require<00:03:11.489> your<00:03:11.820> high<00:03:12.540> beams<00:03:12.840> at

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
actually not require your high beams at

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.979 
actually not require your high beams at
all<00:03:13.230> especially<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:14.010> off-road<00:03:14.610> conditions

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
all especially in off-road conditions

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.780 
all especially in off-road conditions
now<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.050> have<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:17.340> kind<00:03:17.640> of

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
now we have to see what kind of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.289 
now we have to see what kind of
brightness<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:18.860> look<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.100> viewed<00:03:20.579> head-on

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
brightness they look if viewed head-on

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.720 
brightness they look if viewed head-on
so<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:22.140> again<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.739> will<00:03:22.860> first<00:03:23.160> go<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
so now again we will first go with the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.780 
so now again we will first go with the
halogens<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> phone<00:03:25.739> camera<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
halogens this is a phone camera so the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.300 
halogens this is a phone camera so the
lights<00:03:27.000> appear<00:03:27.239> brighter<00:03:27.750> than<00:03:28.019> usual<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:29.070> as

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
lights appear brighter than usual but as

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.699 
lights appear brighter than usual but as
I<00:03:29.340> stand<00:03:29.700> here<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.780> don't<00:03:31.049> really<00:03:31.230> hurt<00:03:31.440> my

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
I stand here they don't really hurt my

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.949 
I stand here they don't really hurt my
eyes<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.519> halogens<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.239> dip<00:03:33.630> mode

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
eyes this is the halogens and dip mode

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.530 
eyes this is the halogens and dip mode
now<00:03:34.530> we'll<00:03:34.709> go<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.010> full<00:03:35.370> beam<00:03:35.640> halogens<00:03:38.540> here

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
now we'll go in full beam halogens here

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.990 
now we'll go in full beam halogens here
you<00:03:39.630> see<00:03:39.840> they<00:03:40.079> get<00:03:40.290> brighter<00:03:40.700> okay<00:03:41.700> my<00:03:41.850> eyes

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
you see they get brighter okay my eyes

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.509 
you see they get brighter okay my eyes
hurt<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.540> bit<00:03:42.720> now<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:43.440> still<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.980> quite<00:03:44.489> a

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
hurt a bit now but it's still up quite a

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
hurt a bit now but it's still up quite a
bit<00:03:44.760> tolerable<00:03:45.239> now<00:03:45.780> let's<00:03:46.019> go<00:03:46.260> with<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
bit tolerable now let's go with the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.390 
bit tolerable now let's go with the
crease<00:03:46.769> now<00:03:47.930> there<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.079> see<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.799> brightness

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
crease now there you see the brightness

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.780 
crease now there you see the brightness
level<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.940> simply<00:03:51.860> out<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.370> world<00:03:53.549> it's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
level is simply out of the world it's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.140 
level is simply out of the world it's
totally<00:03:54.980> outclassing<00:03:55.980> your<00:03:56.280> standard

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
totally outclassing your standard

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.650 
totally outclassing your standard
halogens<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.720> full<00:03:57.989> beam<00:03:58.200> or<00:03:58.470> low<00:03:58.680> beam<00:03:59.660> okay

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
halogens on full beam or low beam okay

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.720 
halogens on full beam or low beam okay
so<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:01.350> let's<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> meat<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480

review any kind of lights all you need
to<00:04:11.700> do<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:12.030> take<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.769> picture<00:04:13.769> with<00:04:13.890> your

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
to do is take a picture with your

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.279 
to do is take a picture with your
digital<00:04:14.190> camera<00:04:14.820> but<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.750> problem<00:04:16.140> with

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
digital camera but the problem with

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.680 
digital camera but the problem with
taking<00:04:16.470> pictures<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.640> if<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.269> do<00:04:18.510> not

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
taking pictures is that if you do not

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.449 
taking pictures is that if you do not
lock<00:04:18.930> down<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.289> exposure<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.919> camera<00:04:20.310> is

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
lock down the exposure the camera is

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.969 
lock down the exposure the camera is
going<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.850> simply<00:04:21.299> adjust<00:04:22.169> exposure<00:04:22.349> for

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
going to simply adjust exposure for

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.150 
going to simply adjust exposure for
every<00:04:23.550> light<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.780> everything<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.070> to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
every light and everything is going to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.560 
every light and everything is going to
look<00:04:26.340> very<00:04:26.370> similar

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570
