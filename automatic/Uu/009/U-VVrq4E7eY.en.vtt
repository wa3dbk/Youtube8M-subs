00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
go to bring the bow up I'd do it a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600 
go to bring the bow up I'd do it a
little<00:01:47.940> bit<00:01:48.180> different<00:01:49.070> bringing<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> bow<00:01:50.400> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
little bit different bringing the bow up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
little bit different bringing the bow up
into<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> tree<00:01:51.150> stand

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
into the tree stand

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020 
into the tree stand
I<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> arrows<00:01:52.530> pointed<00:01:53.190> up<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.760> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I like the arrows pointed up and that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
I like the arrows pointed up and that
way<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.270> keeps<00:01:54.510> them<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:54.990> getting<00:01:55.140> hung<00:01:55.410> up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
way it keeps them from getting hung up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.290 
way it keeps them from getting hung up
in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.800> bushes<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.760> brush<00:01:57.000> guard
