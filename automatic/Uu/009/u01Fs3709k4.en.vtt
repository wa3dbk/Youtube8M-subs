five yards away from a line of cones

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.090 
five yards away from a line of cones
we're<00:03:44.140> gonna<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.380> linebacker<00:03:44.560> standing

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
five yards on the other side I put two

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.229 
five yards on the other side I put two
yards<00:03:47.470> between<00:03:47.620> each<00:03:47.950> set<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.280> cones<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.060> these

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
yards between each set of cones so these

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.170 
yards between each set of cones so these

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
carrier choose where to go we have the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.199 
carrier choose where to go we have the
linebacker<00:03:59.769> move<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.760> movement<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.150> the

linebacker move on the movement of the
ball<00:04:01.450> carrier<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.959> do<00:04:02.110> not<00:04:02.380> give<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> go<00:04:02.950> call<00:04:03.220> or

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
ball carrier I do not give a go call or

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.250 
ball carrier I do not give a go call or
a<00:04:03.430> start<00:04:03.730> call<00:04:03.940> for<00:04:04.120> these<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:04.900> all<00:04:05.080> in

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
a start call for these so it's all in

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.110 
a start call for these so it's all in
the<00:04:05.350> movement<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.800> ball<00:04:05.950> carrier<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:06.940> soon

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the movement of the ball carrier as soon

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.640 
the movement of the ball carrier as soon
as<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.300> ball<00:04:07.480> carrier<00:04:07.810> moves<00:04:08.019> wherever<00:04:08.500> he's

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
as the ball carrier moves wherever he's

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.259 
as the ball carrier moves wherever he's
going<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.010> linebacker<00:04:09.370> takes<00:04:09.640> his<00:04:09.790> read<00:04:09.970> step

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
going the linebacker takes his read step

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.910 
going the linebacker takes his read step
one<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.959> things<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:11.230> always<00:04:11.380> look<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:11.800> is

we're just going to whiz through which

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
we're just going to whiz through which
means<00:04:38.140> we're<00:04:38.289> going<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.560> whiz<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.919> hips

means we're going to whiz the hips
I<00:04:39.460> mean<00:04:39.910> tag<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.390> hips<00:04:40.600> with<00:04:40.840> our<00:04:41.020> hands<00:04:41.440> and

start out very simple just coming

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.490 
start out very simple just coming
downhill<00:04:49.150> then<00:04:49.780> we'll<00:04:49.900> add<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.200> some<00:04:50.380> other
