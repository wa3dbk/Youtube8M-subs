00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
out of control yeah I mean they're just

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.460 
out of control yeah I mean they're just
trying<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.630> get<00:04:48.810> as<00:04:48.960> close<00:04:49.110> as<00:04:49.380> they

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
trying to to get as close as they

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.260 
trying to to get as close as they
possibly<00:04:49.890> can<00:04:50.100> because<00:04:50.340> they're<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:51.030> closer

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270
