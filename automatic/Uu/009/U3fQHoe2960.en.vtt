00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
today's video is going to be about Ram

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.720 
today's video is going to be about Ram
optimizing<00:00:17.600> ok<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.260> basically<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.460> some

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
optimizing ok so basically in some

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
optimizing ok so basically in some
computers<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.779> don't<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.740> RAM

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
computers they don't use all the RAM

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.439 
computers they don't use all the RAM
that<00:00:23.130> they're<00:00:23.310> using<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> computer

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
that they're using on the computer

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.859 
that they're using on the computer
they're<00:00:24.750> only<00:00:24.930> using<00:00:25.670> part<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.449> what

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
they're only using part of it so what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.589 
they're only using part of it so what
you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.949> want<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.599> every

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you want to do is you want to use every

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.889 
you want to do is you want to use every
bit<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.090> helps<00:00:33.390> increase

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
bit that you can so this helps increase

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.250 
bit that you can so this helps increase
your<00:00:34.410> computer<00:00:34.860> speed<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.460> every<00:00:35.760> single<00:00:35.940> way

people who have like let's say two

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.140 
people who have like let's say two
gigabytes<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> RAM<00:01:40.369> but<00:01:41.369> their<00:01:41.640> their

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
gigabytes of RAM but their their

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.080 
gigabytes of RAM but their their
computer<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> only<00:01:43.110> using<00:01:43.409> either<00:01:44.090> 1.2

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
size to your maximum size now example

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.070 
size to your maximum size now example
your<00:02:22.030> maximum<00:02:22.630> size<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:26.430> 2174<00:02:27.430> leting<00:02:28.080> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
your maximum size is 2174 leting but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.080 
your maximum size is 2174 leting but
your<00:02:29.470> initial<00:02:29.950> size<00:02:30.130> only<00:02:31.170> 1000<00:02:32.280> something<00:02:33.280> so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
your initial size only 1000 something so

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.220 
your initial size only 1000 something so
you're<00:02:34.330> going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> want<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> change<00:02:34.990> your

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
you're going to want to change your

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
you're going to want to change your
initial<00:02:35.770> size<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> same<00:02:37.120> amount<00:02:37.270> as<00:02:37.540> your

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
initial size to the same amount as your

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.290 
initial size to the same amount as your
maximum<00:02:38.380> size<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.020> now<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.920> users<00:02:42.430> who<00:02:42.459> do

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
maximum size so but now for users who do

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.520 
maximum size so but now for users who do
not<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:45.070> from<00:02:46.030> type<00:02:46.690> down<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.080> there<00:02:47.230> it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
not have it from type down in there it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070 
not have it from type down in there it
most<00:02:48.160> likely<00:02:48.280> look<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.360> can<00:02:49.810> type

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
most likely look like this can type

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.690 
most likely look like this can type
anything<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.590> blank<00:02:50.830> because<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.610> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
anything or blank because it is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.610 
anything or blank because it is
automatic<00:02:52.209> automatically<00:02:52.959> being<00:02:53.110> managed

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
automatic automatically being managed

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.320 
automatic automatically being managed
you're<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.580> uncheck<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.150> box

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
you're going to want to uncheck that box

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.690 
you're going to want to uncheck that box
and<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.769> want<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.070> go<00:02:57.160> over<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and you want to go over here to the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
and you want to go over here to the
currently<00:02:58.269> allocated<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.350> which<00:03:00.630> over<00:03:01.630> right

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
currently allocated and which over right

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.949 
currently allocated and which over right
here<00:03:02.140> you're<00:03:02.709> going<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.720> whichever<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
here you're going to whichever the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.870 
here you're going to whichever the
bigger<00:03:05.110> one<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.400> how<00:03:06.580> much

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
bigger one is in that that is how much

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.660 
bigger one is in that that is how much
you<00:03:07.630> have<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.110> cut<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.650> currently<00:03:09.489> allocated

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you have so cut the currently allocated

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.600 
you have so cut the currently allocated
right<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.780> should<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.950> maximum<00:03:12.370> amount

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
right here should be the maximum amount

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.940 
right here should be the maximum amount
of<00:03:12.880> RAM<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.930> use<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.320> your<00:03:14.350> computer

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
of RAM that you can use on your computer

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.840 
of RAM that you can use on your computer
so<00:03:15.730> example<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.320> will<00:03:17.709> say<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.280> for

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
so example this this will say like for

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.090 
so example this this will say like for
you<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.329> four<00:03:19.989> people<00:03:20.019> some<00:03:20.680> people<00:03:20.709> out<00:03:21.040> there

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
you if four people some people out there

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100 
you if four people some people out there
they<00:03:21.310> might<00:03:21.430> take<00:03:21.640> 2,000<00:03:22.239> something<00:03:22.420> but

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
they might take 2,000 something but

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.930 
they might take 2,000 something but
you're<00:03:23.290> only<00:03:23.470> using<00:03:23.709> one<00:03:23.890> thousand<00:03:24.519> something

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
you're only using one thousand something

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.370 
you're only using one thousand something
you're<00:03:25.329> going<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.510> want<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.840> change<00:03:26.170> your

you're going to want to change your

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.500 
you're going to want to change your
initial<00:03:26.769> size<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> same<00:03:27.549> exact<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.269> you're

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
initial size to the same exact as you're

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.660 
initial size to the same exact as you're
currently<00:03:29.140> allocated<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.040> if<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.519> have

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
currently allocated and if you have

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.490 
currently allocated and if you have
nothing<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.180> your<00:03:31.299> maximum<00:03:31.750> size<00:03:31.959> you're

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
nothing on your maximum size you're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.539 
nothing on your maximum size you're
going<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> what<00:03:32.769> change<00:03:33.010> you're<00:03:33.160> going<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> put

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
going to what change you're going to put

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.699 
going to what change you're going to put
on<00:03:33.700> your<00:03:33.850> maximum<00:03:34.329> size<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:35.019> same<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:35.530> you're

on your maximum size the same as you're

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.250 
on your maximum size the same as you're
currently<00:03:36.130> allocated<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.690> you're<00:03:37.930> currently

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
currently allocated so you're currently

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.410 
currently allocated so you're currently
allocated<00:03:38.519> maximum<00:03:39.519> size<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.910> initial<00:03:40.239> size

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
allocated maximum size and initial size

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.370 
allocated maximum size and initial size
should<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.350> same<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.540> that's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
should be all the same so and that's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.180 
should be all the same so and that's
about<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.250> click<00:03:45.519> set<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.950> some
