00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.090
 The whole world freezes 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.960
 Heavy snow is an introduction to ruin 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:25.109
 Do human beings die out in Snowball Earth? 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 The heavy snowfall in the metropolitan area was the forerunner of the ice world 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:38.100
 A record heavy snowfall hit Kanto once in 10 years on May 8th, 2014 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 The city of Tokyo records the first major snowfall in 45 years, with a snowfall exceeding 20 cm. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:49.290
 Furthermore, Kanto was hit by heavy snow on the 4th of the following week, and in Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, it was # 1 in observation history how 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.660
 We recorded snowfall amount 76cm 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:00.100
 In addition , an unprecedented large cold wave has arrived in the United States last month 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.479
 Everything is frozen up to the fountain and the world's largest waterfall, Niagara 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:09.050
 In Japan, the 8th of the day of heavy snowfall is for the governor election election 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:12.560
 4 days inside is artificial snow terrorism for Valentine disturbance 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:18.890
 The conspiracy theory was also a topic on the net 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.299
 Kanto and human beings who recorded snowfall that jumped up to such a conspiracy theory are foolish wild animals 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.080
 Yu-type situation in which say that would be taken the life also occurred America 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.670
 Whether there was what the heck 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 In fact, the earth becomes an ice world in this phenomenon 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.860
 There is a view that is not a foreword 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.690
 With the snowball earth where the whole earth freezes 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:48.500
 The Earth has many exceptions, such as the ice age, 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:53.670
 It has been considered that extremely warm environment is maintained 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:00.370
 There is a lot of geological evidence that the Earth seems to have been frozen 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:05.300
 For this reason , it may not have been the whole earth frozen in the recent research in the past 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:10.070
 Much attention has been paid Snowball Earth Earth before freezing hypothesis that 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.450
 According to this theory, the earth is about 2.2 billion years ago 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.790
 About 700 million years close as 600 million years ago, at least three times 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.140
 Considered to be pre-frozen 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.329
 The ice age is that the climate will cool over a long period of time 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:34.210
 Snowball Earth is different in scale and average temperature drops to minus 40 degrees 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:40.270
 The whole area of â€‹â€‹the earth, including near the equator, specializes in ice and ice planets 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.050
 As the earth starts to freeze, the surface ice will reflect the solar energy, so the temperature will increase and decrease 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.270
 Down 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 Freezing goes negative feedback occurs 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:54.090
 It has been said that this condition has continued for about 100 million years 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:03:00.360
 So how did the Earth get out of this frozen state? 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.760
 According to one theory, the ice made by freezing is 1 kilometer thick , and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.569
 The tremendous weight is the stimulus 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.230
 And volcanic activity and earthquakes are caused 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.080
 Ice is gradually melted by the heat generated by the volcanic eruption 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.250
 It is believed that the temperature has risen by the volcanic gas that has been ejected 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.630
 Oh you the crust the crust the crust 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:27.200
 Snowball Earth Causes Explosive Evolution of Creatures 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:31.700
 -40 degrees frozen world resignation is frozen to the surface of the sea or not, and its ice thickness is 1 kilometer 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.220
 The amount of the sea â€‹â€‹that becomes meters does not reach the light of the day 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.900
 Jet black darkness 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:46.280
 How did organisms survive in such harsh conditions? 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:50.690
 Under such circumstances, the creatures should be nearly extinct 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.130
 It is said that bacteria etc. were alive and live on the seabed 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:59.520
 Hot water may be spouted from the crevices of the bottom plate 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:03.480
 I was taking in the volcanic nutrients of the submarine volcano 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.260
 And the point to watch is after snowball earth 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:13.579
 It is that a living thing has achieved great evolution 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:17.870
 The whole earth froze, but the rapid warming after that caused a large breeding of photosynthetic organisms and large oxygen 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:25.340
 A so-called big participation event occurs 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:26.280
 Due to this phenomenon , in Snowball Earth 2.2 billion years ago, eukaryote cells are 600 million years ago 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.480
 Creatures appeared 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:39.220
 It is said that this is the place where it is connected with the Great Cambrian explosion 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:43.960
 Isn't a living being strong enough to change its life form in response to environmental changes ? 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:49.120
 Volcanic activity declines as a major factor in becoming Snowball Earth 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.350
 The global warming effect diminishes as the amount of carbon dioxide released by the eruption decreases 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:59.420
 It is said to have frozen in the cold of advances 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:04.040
 But in fact, the cause of snowball earth has not been properly elucidated yet 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.840
 Perhaps the heavy snow in the United States and Japan freezes the whole earth 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:12.569
 May be a precursor to Snowball Earth 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:20.510
 The statement after Snowball Earth is said to have undergone a major evolution 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:25.690
 Human beings will evolve in a new way even if they die once in a global freeze or will be born as a new humanity 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.690
 This may be the ascension ascension 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160
 Hmm 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.199
 Yeah yeah yeah
