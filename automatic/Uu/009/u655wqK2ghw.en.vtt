00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
head but yeah I use the secondary I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.799 
head but yeah I use the secondary I
don't<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.160> secondary<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.789> sorry<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
don't quote me on this but I think it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.930 
don't quote me on this but I think it
increases<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:57.239> sprint<00:00:58.370> like<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
increases like your sprint like not the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
increases like your sprint like not the
speed<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> longer<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
speed but the longer you go for like I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.140 
speed but the longer you go for like I
think<00:01:02.940> 15%<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:04.080> call<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.150> yeah

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
think 15% don't call me on that but yeah

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.320 
think 15% don't call me on that but yeah
15%<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.610> yeah<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> haven't<00:01:08.909> been<00:01:09.150> posting
