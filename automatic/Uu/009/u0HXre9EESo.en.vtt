um I believe leave slate only activate

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.319 
um I believe leave slate only activate
during<00:02:50.610> your<00:02:51.030> turn<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:52.640> yeah<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.000> want<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
during your turn so yeah if you want to

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.850 
during your turn so yeah if you want to
get<00:02:54.480> gold<00:02:54.810> off<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.079> them<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.379> got<00:02:55.590> tech
