00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
assemble it assembled the kennel like

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.660 
assemble it assembled the kennel like
this<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.720> roof<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.860> roof<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.190> not<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
this the roof the roof is not going to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.270 
this the roof the roof is not going to
work<00:02:42.820> for<00:02:43.150> me<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> I'm<00:02:44.769> just<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> put

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
work for me so I'm just going to put

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.100 
work for me so I'm just going to put
that<00:02:45.400> aside<00:02:45.550> along<00:02:46.150> with<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.390> tarp<00:02:46.660> tarp

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that aside along with the tarp tarp

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.509 
that aside along with the tarp tarp
probably<00:02:47.530> not<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.920> work<00:02:48.070> for<00:02:48.130> me<00:02:48.400> it

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
probably not going to work for me it

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.790 
probably not going to work for me it
wasn't<00:02:48.670> interested<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.420> having<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.260> roof<00:02:50.500> or

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.670 
wasn't interested in having a roof or
tarp<00:02:51.190> anyways<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.940> came<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.290> if

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
tarp anyways but it came with it so if

tarp anyways but it came with it so if
you're<00:02:53.800> going<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> assemble<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.610> normal

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
you're going to assemble it the normal

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.690 
you're going to assemble it the normal
way<00:02:55.000> 4<00:02:55.450> by<00:02:55.690> 8<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:57.070> definitely<00:02:57.250> use

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
way 4 by 8 then you can definitely use

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.410 
way 4 by 8 then you can definitely use
that<00:02:57.910> tarp<00:02:58.440> even<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.950> wood<00:03:00.160> all<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.579> use<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:01.030> 1<00:03:01.209> 2

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that tarp even the wood all I use is 1 2

that tarp even the wood all I use is 1 2
by<00:03:01.600> 4<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.049> going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.260> probably<00:03:02.500> use<00:03:02.680> maybe<00:03:03.010> one

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
by 4 I'm going to probably use maybe one

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.660 
by 4 I'm going to probably use maybe one
more<00:03:03.519> maybe<00:03:04.390> two<00:03:04.750> more<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.160> fasten<00:03:06.579> it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
more maybe two more just to fasten it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.069 
more maybe two more just to fasten it
here<00:03:06.910> into<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> ground<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.690> put<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> couple

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
here into the ground just put a couple

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.720 
here into the ground just put a couple
into<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.440> ground<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:08.950> then<00:03:09.040> connect<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.519> so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
into the ground and then connect it so

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.180 
into the ground and then connect it so
it<00:03:09.850> doesn't<00:03:10.030> move<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.540> we'll<00:03:11.530> see<00:03:11.680> how<00:03:11.860> sturdy

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
it doesn't move and we'll see how sturdy

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.009 
it doesn't move and we'll see how sturdy
the<00:03:12.430> top<00:03:12.670> feels<00:03:12.970> once<00:03:13.209> that's<00:03:13.420> all<00:03:13.600> done<00:03:13.630> I

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the top feels once that's all done I

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.770 
the top feels once that's all done I
might<00:03:14.920> put<00:03:15.130> another<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.970> brace<00:03:16.180> from<00:03:16.450> here

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
might put another just a brace from here

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.620 
might put another just a brace from here
to<00:03:17.260> there<00:03:17.440> maybe<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.340> 2x4<00:03:18.970> or<00:03:19.000> whatnot<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.570> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
to there maybe a 2x4 or whatnot in the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.440 
to there maybe a 2x4 or whatnot in the
middle<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.200> strengthen<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.739> up<00:03:21.450> well

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450
