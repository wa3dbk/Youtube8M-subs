00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
thought the way Ashwin it bold this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.610 
thought the way Ashwin it bold this
would<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:00.899> try<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> maybe

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
would be what you would try that maybe

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
would be what you would try that maybe
the<00:01:02.430> shunt<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.030> Indian<00:01:03.329> Ashwin<00:01:03.690> from

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the shunt with one Indian Ashwin from

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
the shunt with one Indian Ashwin from
the<00:01:03.989> other<00:01:04.110> end<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.040> only<00:01:05.189> four<00:01:05.460> overs

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the other end but with only four overs

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
the other end but with only four overs
to<00:01:05.880> bowl<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.390> he<00:01:06.510> went<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to bowl I think he went to with the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
to bowl I think he went to with the
spinners<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> mall<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.310> case<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
spinners because the mall in case it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
spinners because the mall in case it
didn't<00:01:08.909> work<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.570> wall<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.900> still<00:01:10.110> be

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
didn't work the wall would still be

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
didn't work the wall would still be
hardened<00:01:10.560> new<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> new<00:01:11.340> ball<00:01:11.520> bowlers

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
hardened new for the new ball bowlers

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
hardened new for the new ball bowlers
tomorrow<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.510> AIT's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.840> a

think you know i mean he was born to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.910 
think you know i mean he was born to
lead<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.759> fact<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.030> he's<00:01:36.840> led<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> under-19

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
lead the fact that he's led the under-19
teams<00:01:38.299> even<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> player<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
teams even when he was a player you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
teams even when he was a player you
could<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.560> he<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.490> looking<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
could see that he was he was looking to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.639 
could see that he was he was looking to
learn<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> others<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> i<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.380> that's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
learn from the others and i think that's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.170 
learn from the others and i think that's
that's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.130> big<00:01:44.430> plus<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.909> Virat

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that's a big big plus about Virat

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's a big big plus about Virat
Kohli's<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.659> he's<00:01:45.810> learning<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.530> make

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Kohli's that he's learning we make

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490 
Kohli's that he's learning we make
mistakes<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.880> us<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.180> mistakes<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
mistakes all of us make mistakes but I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.530 
mistakes all of us make mistakes but I
think<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.000> optimism

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
think there is so much you know optimism

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
think there is so much you know optimism
with<00:01:51.869> him<00:01:51.990> becoming<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> captain<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
with him becoming the captain that you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
with him becoming the captain that you
know<00:01:54.030> sometimes<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.509> scares<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.470> scares

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
know sometimes that scares you it scares

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.929 
know sometimes that scares you it scares
you<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you because there's so much of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
you because there's so much of
expectations<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> young<00:01:58.079> man<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
expectations from this young man it is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
expectations from this young man it is
sometimes<00:01:59.130> scary<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.210> he'll<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.390> up

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
sometimes scary but I think he'll be up

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
sometimes scary but I think he'll be up
to<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.530> test<00:02:01.740> century

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to it but with that for test century

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
to it but with that for test century
this<00:02:02.189> captain<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.030> Test<00:02:03.270> matches<00:02:03.479> as

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
this captain in for Test matches as

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.149 
this captain in for Test matches as
captain<00:02:04.079> these<00:02:04.469> still<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.860> he<00:02:04.950> should<00:02:05.100> be

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
captain these still think he should be

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.980 
captain these still think he should be
batting<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.549> number<00:02:05.670> three<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.149> still<00:02:06.719> believe

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
batting at number three I still believe

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.119 
batting at number three I still believe
it<00:02:07.079> number<00:02:07.350> three<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.619> why<00:02:07.710> should<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.009> lose

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it number three but why should we lose

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
it number three but why should we lose
the<00:02:08.340> second<00:02:08.640> wicked<00:02:08.849> early<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.840> are

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the second wicked early because we are

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.820 
the second wicked early because we are
we<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
we are have

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.990 
we are have
problem<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> number<00:02:11.610> three<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:11.910> then

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
problem with the number three but then

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
problem with the number three but then
why<00:02:12.150> isn't<00:02:12.330> he<00:02:12.480> batting<00:02:12.840> why<00:02:12.960> do<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.140> think

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
why isn't he batting why do you think

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.750 
why isn't he batting why do you think
he's<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.530> well<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.710> don't<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.160> why<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.490> is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
he's not well I don't know why that is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.280 
he's not well I don't know why that is
that<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.270> for<00:02:15.450> him<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.630> answer<00:02:15.870> why<00:02:16.140> he's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that is for him to answer why he's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.130 
that is for him to answer why he's
biting<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:17.070> four<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> believed<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
biting it at four but I believed that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.720 
biting it at four but I believed that
the<00:02:19.530> best<00:02:19.740> batsman<00:02:20.130> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.370> batting<00:02:20.640> at

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the best batsman should be batting at

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
the best batsman should be batting at
three<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.420> he's<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> best<00:02:22.110> batsman

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
three and I think he's the best batsman

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
three and I think he's the best batsman
in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> team<00:02:22.830> all<00:02:23.130> right<00:02:23.250> talking<00:02:23.940> about<00:02:24.060> when

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
in the team all right talking about when

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.690 
in the team all right talking about when
he<00:02:24.450> had<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.770> great<00:02:25.770> innings<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> an<00:02:26.460> extent

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
he had a great innings is to an extent

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.280 
he had a great innings is to an extent
but<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.300> fact<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.690> he<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:28.050> three

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
but the fact is that he got three

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.650 
but the fact is that he got three
chances<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> drop<00:02:29.100> catches<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.550> lbw<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.450> he

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
chances to drop catches one lbw if he

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500 
chances to drop catches one lbw if he
shot<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.890> rate<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.400> 7th<00:02:33.150> century

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
shot so would you rate this 7th century

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
shot so would you rate this 7th century
as<00:02:33.630> high<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.870> probably<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> other<00:02:34.560> ones<00:02:34.800> or

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
as high as probably the other ones or

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.950 
as high as probably the other ones or
this<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:36.360> essentially<00:02:36.810> is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
this is just well essentially is

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.810 
this is just well essentially is
essentially<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> batsman<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.730> know

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
essentially you as a batsman you know

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.690 
essentially you as a batsman you know
you<00:02:38.880> get<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.230> chance<00:02:40.560> often<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.490> time

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you get one one chance often this time

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
you get one one chance often this time
he's<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> couple<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.360> chances<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.870> that's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
he's got a couple of chances and that's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.210 
he's got a couple of chances and that's
the<00:02:43.290> important<00:02:43.620> thing<00:02:43.650> when<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.040> those

of you I word on saha the umpire
obviously<00:03:33.120> got<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.390> wrong<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.690> his<00:03:33.780> decisions

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
obviously got it wrong in his decisions

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.350 
obviously got it wrong in his decisions
in<00:03:34.680> Coley's<00:03:35.010> decision<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.430> also<00:03:35.730> very<00:03:36.120> fee

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
in Coley's decision was also very fee

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.310 
in Coley's decision was also very fee
but<00:03:36.510> he's<00:03:36.660> really<00:03:36.870> applied<00:03:37.200> himself

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
but he's really applied himself

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.960 
but he's really applied himself
differently<00:03:37.620> from<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> way<00:03:38.130> he<00:03:38.370> got<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.940> in

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
differently from the way he got out in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.729 
differently from the way he got out in
Australia<00:03:39.450> yes<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:39.989> he<00:03:40.200> had<00:03:40.590> this

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
Australia yes I think he had this

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.199 
Australia yes I think he had this
opportunity<00:03:40.890> recognize<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.940> as<00:03:42.090> an

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
opportunity recognize this as an

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.150 
opportunity recognize this as an
opportunity<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.500> something<00:03:43.739> because<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
opportunity to do something because the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
opportunity to do something because the
pitch<00:03:44.340> was<00:03:44.690> was<00:03:45.690> playing<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.290> little<00:03:46.410> bit

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
pitch was was playing a little bit

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.860 
pitch was was playing a little bit
easier<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.459> Sri<00:03:48.030> Lankan<00:03:48.120> ball<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.570> apart<00:03:48.810> from

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
easier the Sri Lankan ball is apart from

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.090 
easier the Sri Lankan ball is apart from
coastal<00:03:49.320> are<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.560> getting<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.860> ball<00:03:49.950> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
coastal are not getting the ball to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.009 
coastal are not getting the ball to
deviate<00:03:50.489> or<00:03:50.640> turn<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.390> he<00:03:51.630> applied<00:03:51.900> himself

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
deviate or turn and he applied himself

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.080 
deviate or turn and he applied himself
on<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.350> half<00:03:52.500> century<00:03:52.800> end<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.130> again<00:03:53.400> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
on a half century end and again that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.180 
on a half century end and again that
again<00:03:54.390> extra<00:03:54.870> those<00:03:55.110> all<00:03:55.350> those<00:03:55.530> extra<00:03:55.890> runs
