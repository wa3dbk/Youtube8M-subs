put the wet ingredients so the wet

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.350 
put the wet ingredients so the wet
ingredients<00:02:58.170> I've<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.250> six<00:02:59.550> egg<00:02:59.760> whites<00:03:00.060> here

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
ingredients I've got six egg whites here

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.660 
ingredients I've got six egg whites here
I<00:03:00.660> use<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> liquid<00:03:01.200> egg<00:03:01.500> whites<00:03:01.530> forever<00:03:02.370> them

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
I use a liquid egg whites forever them

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.910 
I use a liquid egg whites forever them
because<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.780> much<00:03:03.900> easier<00:03:04.290> especially<00:03:04.380> amount

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920

of eggs that I go through every day and
I've<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:08.010> cottage<00:03:08.370> cheese<00:03:08.730> here<00:03:09.030> low-fat

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
I've got cottage cheese here low-fat

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.970 
I've got cottage cheese here low-fat
cottage<00:03:09.750> cheese<00:03:09.930> or<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.950> a

cottage cheese or if you can get a
fat-free<00:03:12.620> about<00:03:14.750> three<00:03:15.750> tablespoons<00:03:17.239> in

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
fat-free about three tablespoons in

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.600 
fat-free about three tablespoons in
there<00:03:18.530> get<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.650> different<00:03:20.040> mixtures<00:03:20.459> or

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
there get in different mixtures or

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.920 
there get in different mixtures or
proteins<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.390> know<00:03:21.510> we've<00:03:21.600> got<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> egg

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
proteins here you know we've got the egg

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.800 
proteins here you know we've got the egg
whites<00:03:22.170> we've<00:03:22.380> got<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.590> protein<00:03:22.890> powder

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
whites we've got the protein powder

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.720 
whites we've got the protein powder
we've<00:03:24.810> got<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> cottage<00:03:25.350> cheese<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.640> we'll

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
we've got the cottage cheese and we'll

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.449 
we've got the cottage cheese and we'll
also<00:03:26.910> use<00:03:27.299> some<00:03:27.840> Greek<00:03:28.170> yogurt<00:03:28.200> as<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
also use some Greek yogurt as well so

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.800 
also use some Greek yogurt as well so
this<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.790> fat-free<00:03:30.540> Greek<00:03:30.840> yogurt<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.450> put<00:03:33.690> in

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
this is fat-free Greek yogurt and put in

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.070 
this is fat-free Greek yogurt and put in
a<00:03:34.080> couple<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.220> T's<00:03:35.430> tablespoons<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.690> in

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
a couple of T's tablespoons of that in

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.680 
a couple of T's tablespoons of that in
as<00:03:37.200> well<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.680> we've<00:03:37.769> got<00:03:37.890> lots<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.280> different

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
as well so we've got lots of different

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.410 
as well so we've got lots of different
types<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.930> protein<00:03:40.350> faster<00:03:41.130> slower<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
types of protein faster slower and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.789 
types of protein faster slower and
medium<00:03:42.930> release<00:03:43.890> proteins<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.209> there<00:03:45.450> okay<00:03:46.200> so

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
medium release proteins in there okay so

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.460 
medium release proteins in there okay so
then<00:03:46.980> I'll<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.310> mix<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:48.350> just<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.440> little

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
then I'll just mix that in just a little

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.000 
then I'll just mix that in just a little
bit<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.470> I'll<00:03:52.470> add<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.650> wet

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
bit and then I'll add the wet

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:03.430 
bit and then I'll add the wet
ingredients<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.690> dry<00:03:54.780> ingredients

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:13.420 

and<00:04:04.440> then<00:04:04.560> we<00:04:04.709> mix<00:04:04.860> at<00:04:05.099> it

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.340 

now<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.480> bit<00:04:14.629> that<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.230> best

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
now this is the bit that I like the best

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.330 
now this is the bit that I like the best
reason<00:04:18.350> being<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:18.739> because<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.190> wet

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
reason being is because the wet

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.949 
reason being is because the wet
ingredients<00:04:20.000> normally<00:04:20.329> taste<00:04:20.540> better<00:04:20.750> than

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
ingredients normally taste better than

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.980 
ingredients normally taste better than
when<00:04:21.139> it's<00:04:21.290> cooked<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:22.729> what<00:04:23.240> I'll<00:04:23.360> do<00:04:23.539> then<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
when it's cooked so what I'll do then is

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.870 
when it's cooked so what I'll do then is
add<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.919> because<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.310> can<00:04:25.460> see<00:04:25.639> it's<00:04:25.759> pretty

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
add just because you can see it's pretty

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.450 
add just because you can see it's pretty
thick<00:04:26.300> I'll<00:04:26.930> add<00:04:27.289> just<00:04:28.280> like<00:04:28.490> half<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.690> cup

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
thick I'll add just like half a cup

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.570 
thick I'll add just like half a cup
quarter<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.580> cup<00:04:31.759> of<00:04:32.060> water<00:04:33.070> just<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.190> moisten

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
quarter of a cup of water just a moisten

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.629 
quarter of a cup of water just a moisten
it<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:34.970> then<00:04:35.870> depending<00:04:36.470> on<00:04:36.740> your<00:04:36.919> taste<00:04:37.220> I

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
for the metabolism as well so I like to

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.210 
for the metabolism as well so I like to
add<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.650> few<00:04:46.250> shakes<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:48.949> there<00:04:49.130> as

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.020 
like that so let me get a fake katraine
spray<00:05:14.060> some<00:05:14.330> oil<00:05:14.840> in<00:05:15.740> here<00:05:16.010> so<00:05:16.670> I'm<00:05:16.790> using

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
spray some oil in here so I'm using

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.230 
spray some oil in here so I'm using
olive<00:05:17.900> oil<00:05:18.320> just<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.430> little<00:05:19.670> bit<00:05:19.790> just<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.030> stop

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
olive oil just a little bit just to stop

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.330 
olive oil just a little bit just to stop
it<00:05:20.270> from<00:05:20.420> sticking<00:05:20.720> when<00:05:21.020> it's<00:05:21.140> in<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.290> oven

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.050 

and<00:05:25.340> then<00:05:25.490> we<00:05:25.610> just<00:05:25.760> scoop<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:27.320> each<00:05:27.440> one

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.690 

so<00:05:32.060> with<00:05:32.210> each<00:05:32.330> one<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.660> these<00:05:33.580> you're<00:05:34.580> going

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
so with each one of these you're going

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.820 
so with each one of these you're going
to<00:05:34.760> get<00:05:34.910> about<00:05:35.090> roughly<00:05:37.150> anywhere<00:05:38.150> between<00:05:38.830> 10

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
to get about roughly anywhere between 10

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.970 
to get about roughly anywhere between 10
to<00:05:40.270> 15<00:05:41.270> grams<00:05:41.540> of<00:05:41.780> protein<00:05:41.840> depending<00:05:42.620> how<00:05:42.740> big

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
to 15 grams of protein depending how big

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.940 
to 15 grams of protein depending how big
they<00:05:43.160> are<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.490> know<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:45.380> know<00:05:45.500> lights<00:05:45.770> at

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
they are you know so you know lights at

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.710 
they are you know so you know lights at
nights<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.310> lot<00:05:46.340> of<00:05:46.520> people<00:05:46.790> get<00:05:46.970> cravings<00:05:47.240> or

in between meals or stuff like that

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.610 
in between meals or stuff like that

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
instead of reaching for a bowl of

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.790 
instead of reaching for a bowl of
cereals<00:05:52.220> or<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:53.060> chocolate<00:05:53.570> bar<00:05:53.780> or<00:05:54.620> anything

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
like that get much more better off going

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:16.180 
like that get much more better off going
for<00:05:57.410> something<00:05:58.190> like<00:05:58.310> this

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.030 

so<00:06:16.820> now<00:06:17.030> what<00:06:17.240> we're<00:06:17.360> going<00:06:17.510> to<00:06:17.540> do<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.830> put

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
so now what we're going to do is put

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.420 
so now what we're going to do is put
this<00:06:19.130> in<00:06:19.310> an<00:06:19.400> oven<00:06:19.600> of<00:06:20.600> around<00:06:20.900> 200<00:06:21.590> to<00:06:21.680> 220<00:06:22.310> and

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
this in an oven of around 200 to 220 and

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.100 
this in an oven of around 200 to 220 and
put<00:06:22.580> it<00:06:22.670> in<00:06:22.760> there<00:06:22.910> for<00:06:23.030> about<00:06:23.120> 10<00:06:23.420> minutes<00:06:23.720> and

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
put it in there for about 10 minutes and

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.840 
put it in there for about 10 minutes and
then<00:06:24.170> that'll<00:06:24.680> rise<00:06:24.830> and<00:06:25.310> your<00:06:25.490> muffins<00:06:25.760> are

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
then that'll rise and your muffins are

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:39.510 
then that'll rise and your muffins are
