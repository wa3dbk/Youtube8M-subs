00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.049
 there all and all my video on the channel 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 today I will make a review of the product efe 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.680
 what is the whatsapp illuminator will i start 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 By the way, I like the same thing. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.179
 time to say some things I do not like 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.369
 both of it that I liked and that what not 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.210
 I liked the packaging is nonsense of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 card 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.420
 after you crazy out of the tee 9.4 grams 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:38.399
 and that is a gentle entrepreneur to do 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 everything can adapt that the product has 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.109
 here a little that still does not even 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.230
 usually in the field of work of the 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.510
 country that comes with the makeup but ready 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.149
 the packaging so I think the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.190
 packaging very single rotating problem is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.539
 that she grabs the dates all 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 This is a person who has a lot of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.039
 with the data are consolidated in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 products in packaging of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.160
 makeup products actually 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.680
 and then there is always so much cleaning here 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.870
 We have a sponge the can 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.490
 supposed to be helping to mix the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:20.760
 product of the public person but it is already 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.730
 I used affectation that I have dirty is to 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.740
 see a dirty face but instead it was already 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.780
 mixing helps to remove the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 normally mixed with the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.110
 days I think it's easier both the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 ricci illuminator on this side this is 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.630
 illuminating in criticism and color is a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.140
 golden champagne illuminator has some 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 flames 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.100
 So much here and I had already put it here. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.369
 I'm making a new start to this. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.860
 mixtures and it is very 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.480
 easy to mix but only with people 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 mixes very well and stays like this for whoever 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
 know the benefit hype it and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 illuminator is alpha male both hype 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.800
 no crime but no one did it is a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.280
 little softer illuminator I leave 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.780
 but I do not see xvii anymore 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.310
 only nobody ever told me that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.220
 my face is full of brightness not even 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.350
 the very fine subjects just to illuminate 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.650
 to give a goal 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.989
 I did not buy this product 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.239
 mainly because I have 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.069
 powdered minerals 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.470
 limiters will accentuate the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.959
 dry dots of paper or the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.390
 also have wrinkles 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.540
 this man cream is much easier 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.720
 work because I do not feel so much anymore 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 I think it will not accept as much as 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.670
 products in powder illuminators 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.380
 the application is easy as I said I am 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.420
 so I'm in a hurry even apply 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.540
 machine normally does with its crusade. 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 more pages to the face and to the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.910
 light up a face eyebrow 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.040
 if you do not hurry up the twins one 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.950
 brush to take from here prudent but 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.680
 applying the money is much better 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.410
 apply with a brush but I profess 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.130
 in a hurry you do not have time and even 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.280
 packing 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.079
 to unip made the only problem is that 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.329
 I can find there will be the price 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.720
 because I think it 's very expensive though 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.630
 be a good product I think it's the destination 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.250
 cheaper depending if looking for a 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.139
 For some people I even 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.829
 cheap product because it is humble yet 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:02.930
 much more expensive than all this is 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.080
 therefore apply so you can see the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.650
 color 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.810
 if they manage to apply more or less 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.690
 like this 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:17.040
 then color boot hamdy However it is appropriate to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.380
 this kind of brightness that is 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.620
 very beautiful so it's soft is not 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.050
 taught very heavily between the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.430
 prospect who avoid that huck thank you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.430
 by means of videos and until shortly
