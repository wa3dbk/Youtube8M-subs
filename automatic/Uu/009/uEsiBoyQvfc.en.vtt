that's<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.140> really<00:02:48.170> good<00:02:48.590> tip<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.160> i<00:02:49.370> highly

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
that's a really good tip and i highly

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.030 
that's a really good tip and i highly
recommend<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.209> everyone<00:02:50.600> does<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.170> even<00:02:51.950> if

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
recommend that everyone does it even if

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.980 
recommend that everyone does it even if
you<00:02:52.130> don't<00:02:52.310> have<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.670> phone<00:02:52.880> even<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:53.870> your

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
you don't have this phone even if your

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.420 
you don't have this phone even if your

something<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.060> would<00:02:56.480> still<00:02:56.690> do<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.020> because

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
something I would still do this because

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.680 
something I would still do this because
you'll<00:02:57.650> save<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> lot<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.310> space<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.790> your<00:02:58.850> phone

tempted to buy that app will get that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.720 
tempted to buy that app will get that
app<00:03:59.569> but<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.500> know<00:04:00.680> other<00:04:00.860> people<00:04:01.130> would<00:04:01.280> be<00:04:01.459> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
app but I know other people would be and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.960 
app but I know other people would be and
so<00:04:02.300> for<00:04:02.870> me<00:04:03.050> personally<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.890> just<00:04:04.310> don't<00:04:04.760> go<00:04:04.880> on

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
so for me personally I just don't go on

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.030 
so for me personally I just don't go on
the<00:04:05.060> internet<00:04:05.209> market<00:04:05.690> every<00:04:05.900> day<00:04:06.170> because

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
the internet market every day because

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.559 
the internet market every day because
they<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:07.430> attempted<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.850> download<00:04:08.390> more

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
they have attempted to download more

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.570 
they have attempted to download more
apps<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:09.350> other<00:04:09.650> my<00:04:09.860> phone<00:04:10.069> isn't<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
apps and other my phone isn't in the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.520 
apps and other my phone isn't in the
best<00:04:10.700> condition<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.810> buy<00:04:11.959> apps<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.440> stuff

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
best condition to buy apps and stuff

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.280 
best condition to buy apps and stuff
because<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.580> space<00:04:13.819> is<00:04:13.880> kind<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.330> low<00:04:14.510> so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
because the space is kind of low so

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.550
