00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.400 
three was a very special vintage thanks
to<00:00:12.850> their<00:00:13.000> really<00:00:13.270> dry<00:00:13.629> and<00:00:13.930> hot<00:00:14.110> summer

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
to their really dry and hot summer

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.529 
to their really dry and hot summer
however<00:00:15.190> I<00:00:15.279> do<00:00:15.430> think<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.879> there<00:00:16.119> are<00:00:16.150> really

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
however I do think that there are really

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.900 
however I do think that there are really
some<00:00:16.750> nice<00:00:17.039> champagnes<00:00:18.039> being<00:00:18.310> made<00:00:18.550> here<00:00:18.730> and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
some nice champagnes being made here and

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.150 
some nice champagnes being made here and
then<00:00:19.630> this<00:00:19.960> is<00:00:20.080> a<00:00:20.140> special<00:00:20.500> example<00:00:20.920> because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
then this is a special example because

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.620 
then this is a special example because
this<00:00:21.279> one<00:00:21.490> is<00:00:21.609> actually<00:00:21.759> dominated<00:00:22.359> by<00:00:22.570> the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
this one is actually dominated by the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.409 
this one is actually dominated by the
Pinot<00:00:23.439> minier<00:00:23.679> which<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.130> really<00:00:24.519> giving<00:00:25.330> a

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
Pinot minier which is really giving a

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.630 
Pinot minier which is really giving a
lot<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.990> generosity<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.130> fruit<00:00:27.490> in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
lot of the generosity and and fruit in

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.810 
lot of the generosity and and fruit in
here<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:29.439> think<00:00:29.650> this<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.070> first<00:00:30.579> of<00:00:30.730> all

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
here and I think this is first of all

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.470 
here and I think this is first of all
it's<00:00:31.060> quite<00:00:31.449> distinctively<00:00:32.550> wet<00:00:33.550> on<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.060> nose

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
it's quite distinctively wet on the nose

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's quite distinctively wet on the nose
I<00:00:35.039> always<00:00:36.039> associate<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.760> with<00:00:36.789> those<00:00:37.210> roasts

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
I always associate it with those roasts

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.900 
I always associate it with those roasts
and<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.469> nutty<00:00:38.829> aroma<00:00:39.070> they're<00:00:39.610> almost<00:00:41.910> hints

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
and a nutty aroma they're almost hints

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.400 
and a nutty aroma they're almost hints
reminiscent<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.510> pistachio<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:47.079> do<00:00:47.230> have

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
reminiscent of pistachio and we do have

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.569 
reminiscent of pistachio and we do have
some<00:00:47.620> hints<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.949> quince<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.579> pear<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:51.309> there

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
some hints of quince and pear in there

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.229 
some hints of quince and pear in there
really<00:00:51.910> generous<00:00:52.359> fruit<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.960> they're<00:00:54.239> also

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
really generous fruit and they're also

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.060 
really generous fruit and they're also
considering<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.019> high<00:00:56.140> proportion<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.829> that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
considering the high proportion of that

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.979 
considering the high proportion of that
you<00:00:57.370> know<00:00:57.519> phenomena<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.210> Pinot<00:00:58.480> Noir<00:00:58.690> we<00:00:58.870> do

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
you know phenomena and Pinot Noir we do

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.740 
you know phenomena and Pinot Noir we do
get<00:00:59.199> some<00:00:59.460> red<00:01:00.460> fruity<00:01:00.820> notes<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.300> there<00:01:01.510> such

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
get some red fruity notes in there such

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
get some red fruity notes in there such
as<00:01:01.899> wild<00:01:02.859> wild<00:01:03.100> raspberry

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.340 

I<00:01:13.549> think<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> palate<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> Sam<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I think on the palate this is Sam it's a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
I think on the palate this is Sam it's a
quite<00:01:16.530> spicy<00:01:16.920> champagne<00:01:17.520> normally<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.390> don't

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
quite spicy champagne normally we don't

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.820 
quite spicy champagne normally we don't
really<00:01:18.750> talk<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:18.930> spiciness<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> plane

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
really talk about spiciness in a plane

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
really talk about spiciness in a plane
but<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.490> hints<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
but we do get some hints or bit of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.390 
but we do get some hints or bit of
licorice<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.670> will<00:01:23.670> talk<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:23.940> saffron<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
licorice I will talk about saffron and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.590 
licorice I will talk about saffron and
it's<00:01:26.400> quite<00:01:26.640> ample<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.180> round

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it's quite ample and round

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
it's quite ample and round
I<00:01:27.690> think<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> acidity<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.590> still<00:01:29.550> well

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
I think the acidity is still well

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.560 
I think the acidity is still well
integrated<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.050> balanced<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.570> already

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
integrated and balanced and already

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
integrated and balanced and already
quite<00:01:33.869> opulent<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.649> creamy<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.580> nice

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
quite opulent and creamy with a nice

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.200 
quite opulent and creamy with a nice
finish<00:01:36.680> really<00:01:37.680> champagne<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.670> gives<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
finish really champagne that gives me a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.010 
finish really champagne that gives me a
lot<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.390> pleasure<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:42.690> particular

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
lot of pleasure now and this particular

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.910 
lot of pleasure now and this particular
one<00:01:43.290> I'd<00:01:43.409> love<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> pair<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.630> food<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:46.470> usual

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
and something in terms of a bit more
richness<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.940> think<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> Japanese

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
