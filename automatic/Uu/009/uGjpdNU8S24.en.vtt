00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.890
 for the preparation it's super simple 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.540
 I use a protein pod 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 why because I have it on hand 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.790
 and the benchmarks that we will use but 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.770
 you can use any 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 dose is actually enough for just for 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.420
 an idea of proportion so we will leave 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 we will start on pods of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.920
 protein powder for 4 pods of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 five-grain florent 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.620
 we can take the oatmeal it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620
 walk too 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.909
 we're going to put about a third of a 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.350
 thing is to have affiliates 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:05.350
 it's a shower we're facing 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 extremely accurate dosages besides 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 because it's convenient 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.610
 here are the hand in hand then the tyrrell in 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.490
 powder we will still open five 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.069
 practice 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.149
 I like it so I put about one 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.920
 tablespoon it's true it's 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.979
 strong enough to bo may fear 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.179
 but we can decrease both that will change 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.039
 not much in preparation for his 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.530
 consistency and its contributions so 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.720
 always on the dry 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.270
 we had dried it is super good 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 and antioxidants for a deficit 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:55.420
 relatively high will come everything moves 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:01.090
 not on windows is ok so then the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:09.190
 chocolate the same about two-thirds of a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:13.930
 dose here and it will be for the party 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:19.120
 dry of the same match just go 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.110
 mix these are jaguars 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.600
 shareholders 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.270
 in the cairo for the wet part it's 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.020
 it's still relatively simple so 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:42.830
 went about an hour of pure and the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:45.170
 like cashew for the BordeauxthÃ¨que 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.790
 mashed peanuts parliament knowing that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.290
 can put one or the other that obliges me 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.620
 put the two no I like to mix that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:59.410
 exchange 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:59.410
 flavors and / or elsewhere 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.090
 a spoon is enough 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:22.300
 sweetened with protein in poor who 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:31.820
 then already sugar and fruit puree 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:34.090
 a big spoon this time the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.090
 vegetable milk 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.430
 okay let's say we're ready to 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.120
 two tablespoons and will mix 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.319
 all so if it mixes well 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.430
 but spent about 30 seconds at 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.079
 microwave and there it takes it takes well 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.159
 it makes us a kind of easter it's 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:10.120
 where we see that a vote would have everything 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:13.250
 just the two together 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.470
 now it's simple or is 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:22.490
 mixed we go there the snow the snow at 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.680
 maximum finally here is product almost 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.150
 finished so more than just placing it at 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.699
 fridge one to two hours 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.940
 she cuts out and and started after a 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.750
 half past one in the fridge is enough 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.750
 now to cut out 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.639
 and here is your ready-to-wear bar
