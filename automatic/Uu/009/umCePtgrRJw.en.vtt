00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
almost all situations it's very easy to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.090 
almost all situations it's very easy to
build<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> doesn't<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.799> use<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
build and it doesn't really use that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
build and it doesn't really use that
many<00:01:11.460> resources<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.450> without<00:01:12.630> further<00:01:12.960> ado

started with a six by three area this
here<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.150> floor<00:01:21.390> level<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
here is going to be your floor level and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300 
here is going to be your floor level and
the<00:01:21.930> first<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> doing

the first thing we are going to be doing

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
the first thing we are going to be doing
is<00:01:23.549> placing<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.330> our<00:01:24.509> piston<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> want

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is placing down our piston so you want

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
is placing down our piston so you want
to<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> middle<00:01:26.130> block<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to take out that middle block there and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
to take out that middle block there and
place<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.450> sticky<00:01:27.780> pistons<00:01:28.170> facing<00:01:28.320> upwards

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
place two sticky pistons facing upwards

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
place two sticky pistons facing upwards
with<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> block<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.079> we're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
with a block on the top one then we're

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
with a block on the top one then we're
going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> place<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> couple<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> temporary

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

going to place a couple of temporary
blocks<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.340> dispensers<00:01:35.340> facing

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
blocks in here and dispensers facing

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
blocks in here and dispensers facing
into<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> middle<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.860> make

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
into the middle now you have to make

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
into the middle now you have to make
sure<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:39.030> dispensers<00:01:39.540> they

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
sure that these are dispensers they

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
sure that these are dispensers they
can't<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.110> droppers<00:01:40.470> otherwise<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.310> design

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
can't be droppers otherwise your design

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
can't be droppers otherwise your design
isn't<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> work<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> should<00:01:43.380> end

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
isn't going to work but you should end

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
isn't going to work but you should end
up<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.130> something<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.579> looks<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.939> little

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
up with something that looks a little

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410 
up with something that looks a little
bit<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.670> next<00:01:47.670> thing<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
bit like this one next thing you want to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
bit like this one next thing you want to
go<00:01:48.570> off<00:01:48.840> into<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.710> corner<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.700> a

then<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> run<00:01:55.920> redstone<00:01:56.340> dust

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
then you just want to run redstone dust

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.170 
then you just want to run redstone dust
round<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.189> into<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> block<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.149> a

then a repeater running into a block now

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
then a repeater running into a block now
make<00:02:10.020> sure<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.349> set<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> repeater<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.280> three

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
make sure to set that repeater to three

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
make sure to set that repeater to three
ticks<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> redstone<00:02:12.840> dust

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
ticks and redstone dust

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.710 
ticks and redstone dust
on<00:02:13.829> top<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.430> block<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.569> just

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
on top of that block there then you just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.390 
on top of that block there then you just
want<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> place<00:02:16.079> another<00:02:16.620> redstone<00:02:16.860> repeater

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
want to place another redstone repeater

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
want to place another redstone repeater
running<00:02:17.760> into<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.209> block<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:19.110> repeater

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
running into that block and a repeater

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740 
running into that block and a repeater
here<00:02:19.620> set<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.579> three<00:02:21.000> ticks<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.629> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
here set it to three ticks and that is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.270 
here set it to three ticks and that is
going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.110> your<00:02:22.290> double<00:02:22.680> piston<00:02:22.829> extender

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to do your double piston extender

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.000 
going to do your double piston extender
so<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.659> give<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.989> one<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.230> quick<00:02:25.560> tester

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
so if we give this one a quick tester

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.350 
so if we give this one a quick tester
you'll<00:02:26.159> see<00:02:26.370> our<00:02:26.519> double<00:02:26.819> piston<00:02:27.060> extender

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you'll see our double piston extender

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.630 
you'll see our double piston extender
retracts<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.680> goes<00:02:28.920> back<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.610> we

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
retracts and then goes back up so we

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.119 
retracts and then goes back up so we
have<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.120> now<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.540> our<00:02:31.140> dispensers<00:02:31.859> so<00:02:32.069> you

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
have to do now is our dispensers so you

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.559 
have to do now is our dispensers so you
just<00:02:32.340> want<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.489> place<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.879> block<00:02:33.329> like<00:02:33.510> this

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
just want to place a block like this

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.020 
just want to place a block like this
