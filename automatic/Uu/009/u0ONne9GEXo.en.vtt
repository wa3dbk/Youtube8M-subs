need to move in a circle or something

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.690 
need to move in a circle or something
similar<00:00:22.610> in<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.480> kind<00:00:24.050> of<00:00:24.080> like<00:00:24.260> in<00:00:24.380> a

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
similar in a kind of like in a

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.720 
similar in a kind of like in a
geometrical<00:00:25.700> way<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:27.410> problem<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.130> it

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
geometrical way the problem is that it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.279 
geometrical way the problem is that it
may<00:00:28.940> be<00:00:29.000> true<00:00:29.240> that<00:00:29.270> your<00:00:29.570> hand<00:00:29.780> is<00:00:29.870> working<00:00:30.080> in

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
may be true that your hand is working in

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.720 
may be true that your hand is working in
a<00:00:30.320> circle<00:00:30.710> but<00:00:30.890> definitely<00:00:31.400> if<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:31.580> actually

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
a circle but definitely if you actually

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.600 
a circle but definitely if you actually
consciously<00:00:32.360> trying<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:33.250> move<00:00:34.250> within<00:00:34.430> a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
consciously trying to move within a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.440 
consciously trying to move within a
circle<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:35.510> will<00:00:35.629> look<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.930> this<00:00:37.239> okay<00:00:38.270> or

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
circle it will look like this okay or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.620 
circle it will look like this okay or
this<00:00:38.690> or<00:00:39.430> something<00:00:40.430> similar<00:00:40.640> that's<00:00:41.300> because

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
this or something similar that's because

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.690 
this or something similar that's because
you<00:00:41.930> were<00:00:42.079> told<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.680> move<00:00:42.920> your<00:00:43.130> hands<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.610> a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
you were told to move your hands in a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.490 
you were told to move your hands in a
certain<00:00:44.030> way<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:44.239> do<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:44.899> that's

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
certain way you do it but that's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.220 
certain way you do it but that's
actually<00:00:45.829> not<00:00:46.070> what<00:00:46.399> is<00:00:46.520> supposed<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.880> happen

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
actually not what is supposed to happen

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.260 
actually not what is supposed to happen
what<00:00:48.230> is<00:00:48.350> supposed<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.040> happen<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:49.640> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
what is supposed to happen is that the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.270 
what is supposed to happen is that the
arm<00:00:50.480> movement<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.620> hand<00:00:51.890> movement

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
arm movement and the hand movement

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.810 
arm movement and the hand movement
should<00:00:52.489> come<00:00:52.790> from<00:00:53.420> your<00:00:53.870> upper<00:00:54.410> body<00:00:54.590> okay<00:00:55.190> so

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
should come from your upper body okay so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.030 
should come from your upper body okay so
we're<00:00:56.809> going<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.989> take<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> really<00:00:57.620> different

ok<00:02:08.420> when<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.349> sidestep<00:02:09.950> or<00:02:10.099> when<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
ok when you do your sidestep or when you

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.730 
ok when you do your sidestep or when you
do<00:02:10.580> your<00:02:10.729> basic<00:02:10.940> your<00:02:11.750> upper<00:02:12.200> body<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.530> moving

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
do your basic your upper body is moving

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.470 
do your basic your upper body is moving
actually<00:02:13.100> always<00:02:13.520> together<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:14.000> your<00:02:14.270> feet

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
actually always together with your feet

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.570 
actually always together with your feet
so<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.320> upper<00:02:15.530> body<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.010> go

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
so the upper body is going to go

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.530 
so the upper body is going to go
left<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.630> left<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.440> left<00:02:19.220> right<00:02:19.850> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
left right left right left right and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.420 
left right left right left right and
this<00:02:21.230> movement<00:02:21.560> will<00:02:21.740> be<00:02:21.860> transferred<00:02:22.400> to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
this movement will be transferred to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.360 
this movement will be transferred to
your<00:02:23.180> arms<00:02:23.720> automatically<00:02:24.500> okay<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.160> just

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
your arms automatically okay so just

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.730 
your arms automatically okay so just
relax<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.850> shoulder<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.590> will

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
relax the shoulder then you will

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
relax the shoulder then you will
experience<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:29.290> your<00:02:30.290> arms<00:02:30.800> will<00:02:31.310> want<00:02:31.580> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
experience that your arms will want to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.550 
experience that your arms will want to
do<00:02:31.880> something<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.390> their<00:02:32.480> own<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.260> not<00:02:33.410> going

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
do something on their own it's not going

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.890 
do something on their own it's not going
to<00:02:33.620> be<00:02:33.680> very<00:02:33.830> nice<00:02:34.010> right<00:02:34.490> but<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:35.720> actually

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
to be very nice right but they actually

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.810 
to be very nice right but they actually
have<00:02:36.290> their<00:02:36.500> own<00:02:36.530> mind<00:02:36.890> what<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.700> do

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
have their own mind what they want to do

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.390 
have their own mind what they want to do
so<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:38.780> need<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> do<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.470> take<00:02:40.220> this

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
so what we need to do is take this

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.910 
so what we need to do is take this
motion<00:02:41.210> what<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.600> arm<00:02:41.780> wants<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.290> do<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.740> just

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
motion what the arm wants to do and just

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.850 
motion what the arm wants to do and just
give<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.220> some<00:02:43.580> form<00:02:44.120> okay<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.620> need<00:02:45.740> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
give it some form okay so you need to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.260 
give it some form okay so you need to
figure<00:02:46.130> out<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> little<00:02:46.520> bit<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.820> yourself

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
figure out a little bit for yourself

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.440 
figure out a little bit for yourself
just<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.350> try<00:02:48.560> with<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.890> lose<00:02:49.610> arm<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.240> do

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
just just try with this lose arm and do

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.370 
just just try with this lose arm and do
your<00:02:50.600> basic<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.620> sidestep<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.380> figure

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
your basic do your sidestep and figure

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.400 
your basic do your sidestep and figure
out<00:02:54.490> what<00:02:55.490> your<00:02:55.670> arm<00:02:55.880> would<00:02:56.180> do<00:02:56.630> if<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.290> would

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
out what your arm would do if it would

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.730 
out what your arm would do if it would
be<00:02:57.530> totally<00:02:57.680> working<00:02:58.220> alone<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.740> to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
be totally working alone right so to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.370 
be totally working alone right so to
give<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.040> little<00:03:01.130> bit<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.400> help<00:03:02.020> my<00:03:03.020> arm

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
give you a little bit of help my arm

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.650 
give you a little bit of help my arm
would<00:03:04.160> do<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> following<00:03:04.580> when<00:03:05.240> when<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.540> do

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
would do the following when when I do

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.360 
would do the following when when I do
actually<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:06.080> sidestep<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.630> would<00:03:08.900> as<00:03:09.340> my<00:03:10.340> uh

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
actually a sidestep it would as my uh

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.160 
actually a sidestep it would as my uh
probably<00:03:10.610> move<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.270> side<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.840> would<00:03:12.400> just

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
probably move to the side it would just

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.020 
probably move to the side it would just
kind<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.380> let<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:16.010> arm<00:03:16.250> go<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.820> side

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
kind of like let my arm go to the side

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630 
kind of like let my arm go to the side
it's<00:03:17.720> led<00:03:17.960> by<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.200> elbow<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.190> when<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.370> come

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
it's led by the elbow and when I come

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.990 
it's led by the elbow and when I come
back<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.390> whole<00:03:20.660> arm<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.980> comes<00:03:22.400> back<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.880> my

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
back the whole arm just comes back to my

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.680 
back the whole arm just comes back to my
side<00:03:23.330> okay<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.739> elbow<00:03:25.370> goes<00:03:25.550> out<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.150> when<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
side okay so elbow goes out and when the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.690 
side okay so elbow goes out and when the
upper<00:03:26.930> body<00:03:27.140> moves<00:03:27.380> back<00:03:27.650> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
upper body moves back kind of like the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.500 
upper body moves back kind of like the
whole<00:03:28.850> arm<00:03:29.150> falls<00:03:29.570> back<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.340> my<00:03:31.340> side<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.150> this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
whole arm falls back to my side so this

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.530 
whole arm falls back to my side so this
would<00:03:32.660> look<00:03:32.780> like<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:33.230> 1<00:03:33.950> 2<00:03:33.980> 3<00:03:34.420> 5<00:03:35.420> 6<00:03:35.959> 7<00:03:36.170> 1<00:03:36.770> 2<00:03:37.280> 3<00:03:37.540> 5

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
would look like this 1 2 3 5 6 7 1 2 3 5

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.729 
would look like this 1 2 3 5 6 7 1 2 3 5
6<00:03:38.600> 7<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.550> pretty<00:03:40.700> much<00:03:41.200> what<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> would<00:03:42.530> get

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
6 7 this is pretty much what I would get

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.570 
6 7 this is pretty much what I would get
if<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.220> do<00:03:43.340> nothing<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:44.180> my<00:03:44.300> arm<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.580> just

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
if I just do nothing to my arm so I just

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.000 
if I just do nothing to my arm so I just
let<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:47.060> arm<00:03:47.300> thing<00:03:47.510> happen<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.050> just<00:03:48.620> give

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
let this arm thing happen and just give

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.380 
let this arm thing happen and just give
it<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.100> little<00:03:49.220> bit<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.430> form<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.239> are<00:03:50.300> not

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
it a little bit of form so they are not

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.470 
it a little bit of form so they are not
totally<00:03:51.050> uncontrolled<00:03:51.590> ok<00:03:52.070> well<00:03:52.760> ironically

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
totally uncontrolled ok well ironically

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.890 
totally uncontrolled ok well ironically
if<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.050> notice<00:03:54.380> if<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.280> do<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.610> my<00:03:56.570> hands

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
if you notice if you do this my hands

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.510 
if you notice if you do this my hands
are<00:03:56.989> actually<00:03:57.170> moving<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:57.739> circles<00:03:58.250> so

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
are actually moving in circles so

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.610 
are actually moving in circles so
actually<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.480> theory<00:03:59.870> about<00:03:59.930> hands<00:04:00.350> moving

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
actually the theory about hands moving

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.970 
actually the theory about hands moving
in<00:04:00.739> circles<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.250> true<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.770> please<00:04:03.770> don't

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
in circles is true is just please don't

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.780 
in circles is true is just please don't
do<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.130> ok

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
do this ok

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.699 
do this ok
since<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.360> upper<00:04:05.600> body<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.870> moving<00:04:06.050> also<00:04:06.560> when

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
since the upper body is moving also when

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.650
