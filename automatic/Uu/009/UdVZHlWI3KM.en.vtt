we<00:00:47.449> do<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:48.039> examine<00:00:49.039> what<00:00:49.460> areas<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.059> brain

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
we do is examine what areas the brain

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.299 
we do is examine what areas the brain
are<00:00:50.629> involved<00:00:50.899> in<00:00:51.109> memory<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.710> one<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.219> the

are involved in memory and one of the
tools<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:52.910> use<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.149> do<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.539> is

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
tools that we use to do that is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.630 
tools that we use to do that is

neurons in your brain proponents say

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.259 
neurons in your brain proponents say
that<00:01:04.190> if<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.369> shock<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.729> right<00:01:04.850> parts<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.210> the

that if you shock the right parts of the

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.969 
that if you shock the right parts of the
brain<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:05.780> can<00:01:06.080> improve<00:01:06.470> learning<00:01:06.740> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
brain you can improve learning and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.249 
brain you can improve learning and
memory<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.520> maybe<00:01:07.970> even<00:01:08.330> decrease<00:01:08.750> anxiety
