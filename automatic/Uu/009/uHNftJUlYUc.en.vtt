this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.030> most<00:00:03.240> controversial<00:00:03.899> aeroplane

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
this is the most controversial aeroplane

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.960 
this is the most controversial aeroplane
ever<00:00:05.190> made<00:00:05.759> by<00:00:06.029> anyone<00:00:06.390> anywhere<00:00:07.670> this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.820> the

ever made by anyone anywhere this is the
tsr-2<00:00:09.950> it<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> result<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:12.090> immense

tsr-2 it was the result of an immense

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.310 
tsr-2 it was the result of an immense
fantasy<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.099> late<00:00:14.639> 1950s<00:00:15.330> someone

tell me what would be the ideal

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.279 
tell me what would be the ideal
aeroplane<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.310> us<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> the

aeroplane for us to have so the
specification<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.670> something<00:00:27.660> that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
specification really was something that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.370 
specification really was something that
would<00:00:28.019> fly<00:00:28.349> supersonic<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:30.050> virtually<00:00:31.050> North

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380

fundamentally Weybridge and Wharton said

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
fundamentally Weybridge and Wharton said
about<00:00:47.309> making<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:49.070> remarkable

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
about making this really remarkable

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
about making this really remarkable
aeroplane<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> work<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
aeroplane I did a lot of work on the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
aeroplane I did a lot of work on the
development<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.340> said<00:00:53.579> craft

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
development of this as they said craft

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
development of this as they said craft
in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.809> 60s<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.239> final<00:00:57.600> sheet

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
in the in the 60s and as a final sheet

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.849 
in the in the 60s and as a final sheet
it<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.289> superb<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> great<00:01:01.199> problem<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it was superb the great problem was that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.759 
it was superb the great problem was that
nobody<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:03.000> designed<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.960> complex<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
nobody really designed a complex of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.890 
nobody really designed a complex of
weapons<00:01:05.129> system<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.479> required

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
weapons system because what was required

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.429 
weapons system because what was required
was<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.890> airplane<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.640> fly<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:10.110> naught

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
was an airplane that would fly at naught

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.429 
was an airplane that would fly at naught
feed<00:01:10.770> pressure<00:01:11.040> 100<00:01:11.670> maybe<00:01:12.030> 200<00:01:12.360> feet<00:01:12.869> at

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.770 
supersonic now not even Dan dare
couldn't<00:01:16.409> control<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> flight<00:01:17.780> without

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
couldn't control a flight without

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
couldn't control a flight without
putting<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> ground<00:01:19.890> sooner<00:01:20.369> or

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
putting it into the ground sooner or

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
putting it into the ground sooner or
later<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> you've<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.320> automatic

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
later so you've got to have an automatic

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
later so you've got to have an automatic
systems<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.240> predicated<00:01:24.600> on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
systems and this was predicated on

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.090 
systems and this was predicated on
having<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.619> radar<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> nose<00:01:27.920> mapping<00:01:28.920> the

in<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.180> miles<00:01:33.420> time<00:01:33.810> you've<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> hill<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in a miles time you've got a hill or a

signals to the flight services for the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
signals to the flight services for the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
actuators and moves the position of the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.249 
actuators and moves the position of the
aircraft<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> ground<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:46.049> like

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
aircraft so if the ground is going like

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.219 
aircraft so if the ground is going like
that<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.829> airplane<00:01:47.130> comes<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> does<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that the airplane comes and does that

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
that the airplane comes and does that
now<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.290> makes<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.680> virtually<00:01:50.130> invisible<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
now it makes it virtually invisible to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
now it makes it virtually invisible to
radar<00:01:51.360> until<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.799> close<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> if

it's flying at 700 miles an hour you
don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.430> awful<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.600> do

and they had in mind as they do to have

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.539 
and they had in mind as they do to have
this<00:03:23.920> standardized<00:03:24.579> on<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:24.970> NATO<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:27.070> lot<00:03:27.519> of

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
this standardized on in NATO so a lot of

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.770 
this standardized on in NATO so a lot of
pressure<00:03:27.850> was<00:03:28.060> put<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.540> British

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
pressure was put on the British

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.280 
pressure was put on the British
government<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:31.000> exchange<00:03:31.780> was<00:03:32.019> being

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
government the the exchange was being

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
government the the exchange was being
hemorrhaged<00:03:32.799> by<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> cost<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.579> producing

hemorrhaged by the cost of producing
this<00:03:34.269> thing<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.780> therefore<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.459> government

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
this thing and therefore the government

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.069 
this thing and therefore the government
decided<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.630> cancel<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.079> by<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.950> f-111<00:03:40.079> now
