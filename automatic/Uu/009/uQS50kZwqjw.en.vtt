we have done kind of the reduction of it
I<00:00:43.140> thought<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.670> than

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
I thought it was not more than

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.850 
I thought it was not more than
appropriate<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> homage<00:00:46.800> to

this<00:00:53.579> collection<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.269> mostly<00:00:54.690> like

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this collection it was mostly like

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.930 
this collection it was mostly like
starting<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.500> optical<00:00:56.280> mode<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> black

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
starting with optical mode is the black

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
starting with optical mode is the black
and<00:00:57.120> white<00:00:57.269> stripe<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and white stripe the really the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.430 
and white stripe the really the
graphical<00:00:59.610> effects<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.660> mixing<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
graphical effects and then mixing this

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.100 
graphical effects and then mixing this
the<00:01:01.710> color<00:01:01.920> box<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.850> seems<00:01:03.239> quite<00:01:03.750> easy

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the color box which seems quite easy

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
the color box which seems quite easy
until<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.009> begin<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.400> read<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
until you begin to read it and then you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450 
until you begin to read it and then you
discover<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.259> difficult<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.009> making<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
discover how we difficult of making a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
discover how we difficult of making a
nice<00:01:08.610> color<00:01:08.880> block<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:10.100> because<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
nice color block can be because a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
nice color block can be because a
collection<00:01:11.580> inspired<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.240> q2<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> wanted

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
collection inspired on q2 you I wanted

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
collection inspired on q2 you I wanted
to<00:01:13.259> have<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.950> families<00:01:14.340> shapes<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.850> not

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to have more families shapes but not

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
to have more families shapes but not
doing<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> normal<00:01:15.899> pleats<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> really

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
doing the normal pleats and the really

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
doing the normal pleats and the really
the<00:01:17.009> gathering<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.479> more<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.170> grab

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the gathering it was more like you grab

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
the gathering it was more like you grab
a<00:01:19.500> piece<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.890> fabric<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.670> okay<00:01:20.940> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a piece of fabric you say okay this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
a piece of fabric you say okay this
gives<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> nice<00:01:21.570> drape<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> took<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
gives a nice drape and now I took it so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
gives a nice drape and now I took it so
it<00:01:23.070> gives<00:01:23.250> kind<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> very<00:01:23.850> spontaneous<00:01:24.090> way

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it gives kind of a very spontaneous way

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
it gives kind of a very spontaneous way
the<00:01:25.320> effect<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.800> simple<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> achieve<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the effect is simple but to achieve that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
the effect is simple but to achieve that
effect<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.390> quite<00:01:27.690> complicated<00:01:28.020> far

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
effect actually quite complicated far

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
effect actually quite complicated far
more<00:01:28.710> complicated<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.550> a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
more complicated that I do a

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.840 
more complicated that I do a
propertyless<00:01:30.000> rape<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.869> say<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> thing

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to get to orange or purple you have to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.930 
to get to orange or purple you have to
build<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.890> eye<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
build the eye for it and you have to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.150 
build the eye for it and you have to
probably<00:02:12.330> add<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.800> metallic

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160

probably add in a little bit of metallic
a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.150> bit<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
a little bit of this a little bit of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.229 
a little bit of this a little bit of
that<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> he<00:02:15.959> did<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.200> very<00:02:16.500> very<00:02:16.620> well<00:02:17.239> this

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that and he did it very very well this

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.910 
that and he did it very very well this
is<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> basic<00:02:19.080> white<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> men's

applique<00:02:21.989> on<00:02:22.110> top<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.129> gives<00:02:23.370> that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
applique on top of it but it gives that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
kind of elegance to do one which I

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.490 
kind of elegance to do one which I
really<00:02:25.890> like

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
really like

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500 
really like
so<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.160> fact<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:28.550> completely<00:02:28.700> again<00:02:29.300> like

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so in fact it's completely again like

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.350 
so in fact it's completely again like
the<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.290> optical<00:02:30.770> motives<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.030> will<00:02:32.240> be

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the the optical motives but this will be

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.540 
the the optical motives but this will be
obtained<00:02:32.810> by<00:02:33.020> using<00:02:33.290> different<00:02:33.650> beyonds<00:02:34.160> on

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
obtained by using different beyonds on

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.460 
obtained by using different beyonds on
the<00:02:34.670> beats<00:02:34.880> what<00:02:35.150> means<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.540> every<00:02:35.810> Bayete

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the beats what means that every Bayete

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.950 
the beats what means that every Bayete
has<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.860> be<00:02:36.980> put<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> by<00:02:37.610> hand<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.600> hand
