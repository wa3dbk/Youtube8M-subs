take<00:01:15.250> some<00:01:15.460> glue<00:01:15.610> dots<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.120> can<00:01:16.150> use<00:01:17.100> hot<00:01:18.100> glue

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
take some glue dots you can use hot glue

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.860 
take some glue dots you can use hot glue
gun<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.550> liquid<00:01:18.850> glass<00:01:19.030> whatever<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.660> like

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
but you'll just take the ends and fold

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.910 
but you'll just take the ends and fold
them<00:01:24.940> into<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.600> center<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:29.590> do<00:01:29.800> the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
them into the center and then do the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.900 
them into the center and then do the
same<00:01:30.190> thing<00:01:30.490> with<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.670> other<00:01:30.790> end<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.610> put<00:01:33.820> it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
same thing with the other end and put it

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.810 
same thing with the other end and put it
right<00:01:33.940> on<00:01:34.300> top<00:01:34.510> of<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:34.840> one<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.430> then<00:01:36.610> you'll

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
right on top of that one so then you'll

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.690 
right on top of that one so then you'll
form<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.510> shape<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.050> bow<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.680> just<00:01:39.430> flip

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
form the shape of the bow and just flip

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.990 
form the shape of the bow and just flip
it<00:01:39.850> over<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:40.540> your<00:01:41.550> pieces<00:01:42.550> are<00:01:42.820> down

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
it over so it's your pieces are down

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.270 
it over so it's your pieces are down
below<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.590> we're<00:01:44.740> going<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.890> take<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
below and then we're going to take the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.160 
below and then we're going to take the
little<00:01:45.400> strip<00:01:45.730> of<00:01:45.760> paper<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.330> just<00:01:46.720> fold<00:01:47.020> it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
little strip of paper and just fold it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.670 
little strip of paper and just fold it
over<00:01:48.480> so<00:01:49.480> you<00:01:49.570> get<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.840> center<00:01:50.200> part<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.620> your

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680

over so you get the center part of your
bow<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:52.440> edit<00:01:53.440> here<00:01:54.360> another<00:01:55.360> little<00:01:56.250> glue
