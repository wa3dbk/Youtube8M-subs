hey<00:00:00.149> guys<00:00:00.359> sword<00:00:00.690> here<00:00:00.989> and<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.620> to

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey guys sword here and this is going to

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys sword here and this is going to
be<00:00:01.770> one<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.040> the<00:00:02.129> features<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:02.520> tu14<00:00:03.179> has<00:00:03.510> to

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
be one of the features that tu14 has to

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.480 
be one of the features that tu14 has to
offer<00:00:03.840> or<00:00:04.319> one<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.650> new<00:00:04.799> items<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.339> that

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
offer or one of the new items and that

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.789 
offer or one of the new items and that
would<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.180> trip<00:00:06.450> wire<00:00:06.660> hook<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.680> it

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
would be the trip wire hook so I have it

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.650 
would be the trip wire hook so I have it
right<00:00:07.919> here<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.340> hand<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.480> need

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
right here in my hand and what you need

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
right here in my hand and what you need
to<00:00:09.870> create<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.550> need<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.759> go<00:00:11.849> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
to create it is that you need to go to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.490 
to create it is that you need to go to
your<00:00:12.120> crafting<00:00:12.480> table<00:00:12.840> go<00:00:13.110> down<00:00:13.320> to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
your crafting table go down to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.919 
your crafting table go down to
mechanisms<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.969> create<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.540> need<00:00:15.719> one

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
mechanisms and to create it you need one

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.800 
mechanisms and to create it you need one
bar<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.590> stick<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.430> plank<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.970> order<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
bar one stick and one plank in order to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.260 
bar one stick and one plank in order to
create<00:00:19.109> two<00:00:19.439> trip<00:00:19.800> wire<00:00:20.010> hooks<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:21.060> work

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
create two trip wire hooks and they work

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.080 
create two trip wire hooks and they work
exactly<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:22.199> redstone<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
exactly like redstone so if you know a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
exactly like redstone so if you know a
lot<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.539> redstone<00:00:25.109> mechanics<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lot about redstone mechanics then the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
lot about redstone mechanics then the
trip<00:00:26.490> wire<00:00:26.670> hook<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> great<00:00:28.080> deal

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
trip wire hook is gonna be a great deal

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.759 
trip wire hook is gonna be a great deal
so<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.609> don't<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.599> place<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so I don't have to actually place it you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
so I don't have to actually place it you
have<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.099> actually<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> wall<00:00:33.120> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
have to actually put it on a wall so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
have to actually put it on a wall so
here<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.770> tripwire<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
here you go there's a tripwire can you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
here you go there's a tripwire can you
put<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.149> glowstone<00:00:36.570> no<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> cannot<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
put on glowstone no you cannot so I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080 
put on glowstone no you cannot so I
guess<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.309> cannot<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> glass<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
guess you cannot put on glass and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.510 
guess you cannot put on glass and
glowstone<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.930> far<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.309> any

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
glowstone as far as I know but in any

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
glowstone as far as I know but in any
other<00:00:41.670> block<00:00:42.000> you're<00:00:42.239> able<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
other block you're able to do so of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
other block you're able to do so of
course<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.950> put<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> cactus<00:00:44.579> that's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
course you can put on a cactus that's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.470 
course you can put on a cactus that's
just<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.899> practical<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
just not practical so what you need to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
just not practical so what you need to
do<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:49.020> let<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.710> ahead<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.950> put<00:00:50.160> some

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
do well let me go ahead and put some

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
do well let me go ahead and put some
sand<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.660> stand<00:00:51.960> right

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
sand right here and some stand right

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.160 
sand right here and some stand right
here<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.020> need

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
here right here there you go so you need

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
here right here there you go so you need
to<00:00:55.260> place<00:00:55.590> some<00:00:56.309> trip<00:00:56.699> wire<00:00:56.879> hooks<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.300> both

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to place some trip wire hooks on both

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
to place some trip wire hooks on both
sides<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.489> you're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> need<00:00:59.879> some

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sides and you're going to need some

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
sides and you're going to need some
string<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> or<00:01:00.719> enough<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> connect<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.649> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
string in or enough to connect them so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.390 
string in or enough to connect them so
you<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> play<00:01:02.789> string<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you have to play string down here and it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.789 
you have to play string down here and it
will<00:01:05.549> automatically<00:01:06.150> connect<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.930> both<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
will automatically connect them both you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
will automatically connect them both you
don't<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> put<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> trip

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
don't actually have to put on the trip

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.730 
don't actually have to put on the trip
wire<00:01:09.780> hook<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.619> gets

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
wire hook because it kind of gets

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
wire hook because it kind of gets
confusing<00:01:11.189> sometimes<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.700> can't<00:01:11.909> even<00:01:11.970> see

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
confusing sometimes you can't even see

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990 
confusing sometimes you can't even see
it<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> does<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> put

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it when it does that so I'm going to put

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
it when it does that so I'm going to put
on<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.720> redstone<00:01:16.080> lamp<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.430> redstone

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
on a redstone lamp here and a redstone

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390 
on a redstone lamp here and a redstone
lamp<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.020> I'll<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.159> walk

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
lamp here and I'll get to do is walk

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.370 
lamp here and I'll get to do is walk
across<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
across and then there you go it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
across and then there you go it
activates<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.340> entity<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.600> were<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
activates the entity if you were to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
activates the entity if you were to
actually<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.140> over<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.560> examine<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
actually go over here and examine it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.179 
actually go over here and examine it
it's<00:01:27.240> activated<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:28.080> an<00:01:28.259> entity<00:01:28.439> passes

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it's activated when an entity passes

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.670 
it's activated when an entity passes
through<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> connected<00:01:30.000> tripwire<00:01:30.450> oh<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
through a connected tripwire oh so it's

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
through a connected tripwire oh so it's
just<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:32.000> okay<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> entity<00:01:33.720> okay<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just me okay I'm the entity okay that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
just me okay I'm the entity okay that
makes<00:01:34.350> sense<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> works<00:01:35.820> exactly<00:01:36.119> like

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
makes sense but it works exactly like

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.990 
makes sense but it works exactly like
redstone<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> here's<00:01:38.520> another<00:01:38.759> interesting

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
redstone and here's another interesting

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.690 
redstone and here's another interesting
deal<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.170> could<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.500> place<00:01:40.950> an<00:01:41.130> item<00:01:41.310> on

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
deal you could actually place an item on

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700 
deal you could actually place an item on
the<00:01:41.909> trip<00:01:42.119> wire<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.659> it'll<00:01:43.110> activate<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.590> as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the trip wire and it'll activate it as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.539 
the trip wire and it'll activate it as
well<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:46.890> interesting

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
well so it's really really interesting

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.310 
well so it's really really interesting
is<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:48.119> will<00:01:48.299> actually<00:01:48.750> work<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
is to see how will actually work and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
is to see how will actually work and
I've<00:01:49.920> already<00:01:50.100> set<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.909> bit<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> an

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I've already set up a little bit of an

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
I've already set up a little bit of an
area<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.250> take<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
area over here so that we could take a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
area over here so that we could take a
better<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.869> here's<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.619> little

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
better look at it so here's the little

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 
better look at it so here's the little
trip<00:01:55.979> wire<00:01:56.159> hook<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:56.549> sorry<00:01:57.000> triple<00:01:57.450> our<00:01:57.509> hooks

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
trip wire hook or sorry triple our hooks

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
trip wire hook or sorry triple our hooks
on<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> side<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.740> string<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
on the side the string that's in the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.270 
on the side the string that's in the
bottom<00:02:00.299> well<00:02:00.780> obviously<00:02:01.170> since<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.920> sand

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
bottom well obviously since it's on sand

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.069 
bottom well obviously since it's on sand
you'll<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> able<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> tell<00:02:03.149> where<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you'll be able to tell where it's at but

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.289 
you'll be able to tell where it's at but
if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.200> were<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> put<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.969> dark<00:02:05.969> blocks

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
if you were to put it on dark blocks

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
if you were to put it on dark blocks
maybe<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.930> cobblestone<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.039> won't<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.369> able

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
maybe even cobblestone you won't be able

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.880 
maybe even cobblestone you won't be able
to<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.539> let<00:02:09.959> me<00:02:09.989> try<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.560> right

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to see it so let me try that out right

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
to see it so let me try that out right
here<00:02:11.190> first<00:02:11.610> walk<00:02:12.030> through<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.510> lights<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:13.050> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
here first walk through it lights up and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.790 
here first walk through it lights up and
here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.910 
here
the<00:02:13.950> deal<00:02:14.160> even<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.270> destroy<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.170> string

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the deal even if you destroy the string

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.570 
the deal even if you destroy the string
it<00:02:17.850> will<00:02:18.030> activate<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.740> imagine<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.430> there

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
it will activate it so imagine if there

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.150 
it will activate it so imagine if there
were<00:02:20.670> T&amp;T<00:02:21.090> blocks<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.560> even<00:02:23.070> if

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
were T&amp;T blocks here and here even if

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.460 
were T&amp;T blocks here and here even if
you<00:02:23.250> destroy<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.700> string<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you destroy the string it's going to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.950 
you destroy the string it's going to
blow<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.670> let<00:02:27.210> me<00:02:27.330> show<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.570> guys<00:02:27.690> with

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
blow up so let me show you guys with

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.330 
blow up so let me show you guys with
what<00:02:28.110> you're<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> need<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:28.920> let<00:02:29.280> me

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
what you're going to need to do let me

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.270 
what you're going to need to do let me
get<00:02:29.460> rid<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.610> these<00:02:29.760> two<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.860> let<00:02:31.860> me<00:02:31.920> put<00:02:32.100> t

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
get rid of these two and let me put t

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.090 
get rid of these two and let me put t
and<00:02:32.460> t<00:02:32.610> blocks<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.120> top<00:02:33.440> what<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> need<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.920> do

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
and t blocks on top what you need to do

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.090 
and t blocks on top what you need to do
in<00:02:35.340> order<00:02:35.490> not<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> detonate<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> T&amp;T<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.950> go

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
in order not to detonate the T&amp;T it's go

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.040 
in order not to detonate the T&amp;T it's go
to<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.310> trip<00:02:38.520> wire<00:02:38.640> hook<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.150> destroy<00:02:40.020> it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
to a trip wire hook and destroy it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.860 
to a trip wire hook and destroy it
simply<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.760> could<00:02:41.880> destroy<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.300> walk

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
simply is that you could destroy it walk

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.130 
simply is that you could destroy it walk
on<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.200> trip<00:02:43.470> wire<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.250> won't<00:02:44.400> blow<00:02:44.640> up

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
on the trip wire and it won't blow up

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.050 
on the trip wire and it won't blow up
yeah<00:02:46.140> that's<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.740> interesting<00:02:46.920> deal<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.580> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
yeah that's the interesting deal and you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.270 
yeah that's the interesting deal and you
can<00:02:48.180> destroy<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.980> would<00:02:50.130> really

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
can destroy that it but you would really

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
can destroy that it but you would really
want<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.780> want<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.020> get<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
want to do that if you want to get the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.810 
want to do that if you want to get the
string<00:02:52.440> back<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
string back you're going to have to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
string back you're going to have to
actually<00:02:54.030> destroy<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.690> block<00:02:54.900> underneath

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
actually destroy the block underneath

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.410 
actually destroy the block underneath
there<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.040> destroy<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> block<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
there so destroy the block you get the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.540 
there so destroy the block you get the
string<00:02:57.660> back<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.590> remember<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.490> our

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
string back but remember if that our

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.010 
string back but remember if that our
trip<00:02:59.760> wire<00:02:59.970> hooks<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.330> both<00:03:00.510> sides<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:00.960> you

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
trip wire hooks on both sides and if you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.670 
trip wire hooks on both sides and if you
do<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:02.400> detonate<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.500> I'll

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
do this it will detonate like so I'll

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.920 
do this it will detonate like so I'll
even<00:03:04.920> show<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.160> an<00:03:05.280> example<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:05.930> just

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
even show you an example right here just

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.240 
even show you an example right here just
let<00:03:07.050> me<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.200> rid<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.440> T&amp;T<00:03:07.680> blocks<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
let me get rid of the T&amp;T blocks is I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.310 
let me get rid of the T&amp;T blocks is I
really<00:03:08.490> don't<00:03:08.640> want<00:03:08.760> anything<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.090> blow<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.540> so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
really don't want anything to blow up so

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.390 
really don't want anything to blow up so
here<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.280> go<00:03:12.050> trip<00:03:13.050> wire<00:03:13.230> hook<00:03:13.440> trip<00:03:14.010> our<00:03:14.190> hook

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
here you go trip wire hook trip our hook

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
here you go trip wire hook trip our hook
it'll<00:03:14.700> already<00:03:14.910> automatically<00:03:15.660> connect

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it'll already automatically connect

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080 
it'll already automatically connect
destroy<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> bottom<00:03:17.160> block<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.820> still

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
destroy the bottom block and it still

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
destroy the bottom block and it still
lights<00:03:18.300> up<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.200> be<00:03:19.470> careful<00:03:19.890> when<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> do<00:03:20.280> this

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
lights up so be careful when you do this

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.220 
lights up so be careful when you do this
cuz<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.300> wouldn't<00:03:21.570> want<00:03:21.690> anything<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.110> blow

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
cuz you wouldn't want anything to blow

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.800 
cuz you wouldn't want anything to blow
up<00:03:22.530> again<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.700> fantastic<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.750> could

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
up again it is fantastic if you could

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.300 
up again it is fantastic if you could
have<00:03:24.989> set<00:03:25.170> up<00:03:25.290> traps<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.890> you're<00:03:26.250> gonna

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
have set up traps or you're gonna

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.270 
have set up traps or you're gonna

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
activate secret rooms with trip wire and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.330 
activate secret rooms with trip wire and
let<00:03:29.910> me<00:03:30.000> go<00:03:30.120> ahead<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.420> put<00:03:30.810> some<00:03:31.110> let<00:03:32.040> me<00:03:32.130> see

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
let me go ahead and put some let me see

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330 
let me go ahead and put some let me see
maybe<00:03:32.730> put<00:03:33.000> some<00:03:33.830> where's<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.920> at<00:03:35.040> where's<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
maybe put some where's it at where's it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.810 
maybe put some where's it at where's it
at<00:03:35.489> where's<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:36.500> stone<00:03:37.500> let's<00:03:38.100> see<00:03:38.310> if<00:03:38.520> it's

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
at where's it at stone let's see if it's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.699 
at where's it at stone let's see if it's
actually<00:03:39.000> quite<00:03:39.420> hidden<00:03:39.870> well<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.560> were

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
actually quite hidden well if you were

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.610 
actually quite hidden well if you were
to<00:03:40.800> put<00:03:40.950> stone<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.489> here<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.630> here<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.260> go<00:03:43.290> here

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
to put stone on here so here you go here

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.620 
to put stone on here so here you go here
you<00:03:43.650> go<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:44.280> show<00:03:44.489> these<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.910> show<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.330> but

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
you go to show these to show that but

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.560 
you go to show these to show that but
those<00:03:45.870> here<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.880> put<00:03:47.880> some<00:03:48.000> string<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
those here and put some string on the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.199 
those here and put some string on the
bottom<00:03:48.930> okay<00:03:49.680> yeah<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.459> could<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.940> could<00:03:51.030> you

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
bottom okay yeah you could you could you

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.690 
bottom okay yeah you could you could you
can<00:03:51.420> barely<00:03:51.840> tell<00:03:52.020> it's<00:03:52.470> there<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:53.550> could

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
can barely tell it's there you could

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.040 
can barely tell it's there you could
barely<00:03:53.880> tell<00:03:54.150> there<00:03:54.390> if<00:03:54.510> you're<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.780> not

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
barely tell there if you're just not

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.590 
barely tell there if you're just not
even<00:03:55.290> paying<00:03:55.380> attention<00:03:55.940> well<00:03:56.940> you're<00:03:57.390> dead

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
even paying attention well you're dead

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.020 
even paying attention well you're dead
if<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:58.260> were<00:03:58.380> TT<00:03:58.770> blocks<00:03:59.040> depending<00:03:59.850> on<00:03:59.850> how

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
if there were TT blocks depending on how

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.910 
if there were TT blocks depending on how
much<00:04:00.150> TNT<00:04:00.570> blocks<00:04:00.840> there<00:04:01.050> is<00:04:01.230> but<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.680> course

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
much TNT blocks there is but of course

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.210 
much TNT blocks there is but of course
for<00:04:02.640> anyone<00:04:03.030> who<00:04:03.239> wants<00:04:03.480> bake<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:04.220> 10,000

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
for anyone who wants bake like 10,000

for anyone who wants bake like 10,000
T&amp;T<00:04:05.489> blocks<00:04:05.940> explode<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.570> once<00:04:06.750> you're<00:04:07.320> gonna

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
T&amp;T blocks explode at once you're gonna

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.100 
T&amp;T blocks explode at once you're gonna
die<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.130> here's<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.060> interesting<00:04:09.239> part<00:04:09.480> you

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
die and here's the interesting part you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.350 
die and here's the interesting part you
could<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.440> make<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.830> string<00:04:11.130> float<00:04:11.550> so

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
could actually make the string float so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.729 
could actually make the string float so
you<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.840> barely<00:04:13.050> even<00:04:13.140> see<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.560> right<00:04:13.709> here

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
you can barely even see it right here

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.280 
you can barely even see it right here
you<00:04:14.610> could<00:04:14.760> barely<00:04:15.180> barely<00:04:15.900> see<00:04:16.109> it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
you could barely barely see it

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.650 
you could barely barely see it
especially<00:04:16.980> if<00:04:17.609> you're<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:18.060> dark<00:04:18.299> room<00:04:18.390> you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
especially if you're in a dark room you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.690 
especially if you're in a dark room you
cannot<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.859> can<00:04:20.010> walk<00:04:20.160> through<00:04:20.400> here

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
cannot see it you can walk through here

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.210 
cannot see it you can walk through here
and<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.269> will<00:04:21.299> light<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.750> still<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.350> nor

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
and it will light up still and nor

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.770 
and it will light up still and nor
enough<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.729> well<00:04:24.270> let<00:04:24.390> me<00:04:24.450> show<00:04:24.539> the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
enough to do that well let me show the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.140 
enough to do that well let me show the
string<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.220> string<00:04:26.430> actually<00:04:26.789> flow

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
string if the string actually flow

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.060 
string if the string actually flow
so<00:04:27.270> that's<00:04:27.419> actually<00:04:27.780> interesting<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.710> here

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
so that's actually interesting so here

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.530 
so that's actually interesting so here
this<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.550> where<00:04:29.699> it's<00:04:29.850> more<00:04:29.970> practical<00:04:30.180> to

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
this is where it's more practical to

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.870 
this is where it's more practical to
actually<00:04:31.169> place<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.009> on<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.160> trip<00:04:32.490> wire<00:04:32.669> hook

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
actually place it on the trip wire hook

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.999 
actually place it on the trip wire hook
so<00:04:33.509> it's<00:04:33.810> going<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.020> float<00:04:34.259> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.710> see<00:04:34.889> the

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
so it's going to float you can see the

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.650 
so it's going to float you can see the
little<00:04:35.160> block<00:04:35.460> right<00:04:35.699> here<00:04:35.729> it's<00:04:36.449> going<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
little block right here it's going to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.450 
little block right here it's going to
float<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.590> put<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.830> right<00:04:37.919> here<00:04:37.979> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
float you can put it right here and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.820 
float you can put it right here and
connect<00:04:39.240> them<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.600> then<00:04:40.110> there<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.470> go<00:04:40.500> pass

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
connect them and then there you go pass

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.129 
connect them and then there you go pass
through<00:04:41.039> it<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.280> then<00:04:41.580> there<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.910> go<00:04:42.139> it's

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
through it and then there you go it's

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.800 
through it and then there you go it's
brilliant<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> little<00:04:45.389> spot<00:04:45.630> that

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
brilliant and this is a little spot that

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.020 
brilliant and this is a little spot that
I<00:04:45.840> made<00:04:46.229> just<00:04:46.650> for<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.220> show<00:04:47.430> what<00:04:47.789> how<00:04:47.970> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
I made just for to show what how you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.520 
I made just for to show what how you
could<00:04:48.270> actually<00:04:48.419> make<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.750> more<00:04:48.870> practical

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
could actually make it more practical

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.520 
could actually make it more practical
that<00:04:50.310> you'll<00:04:50.940> be<00:04:51.090> more<00:04:51.330> hidden<00:04:51.570> except<00:04:52.440> if

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
that you'll be more hidden except if

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.659 
that you'll be more hidden except if
they<00:04:52.650> were<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.949> look<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.340> left<00:04:53.490> or<00:04:53.639> right

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
they were to look to the left or right

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.040 
they were to look to the left or right
this<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.150> why<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.389> have<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.720> make<00:04:54.840> it<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.960> little

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
this is why you have to make it a little

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.779 
this is why you have to make it a little
bit<00:04:55.199> more<00:04:55.320> further<00:04:55.590> down<00:04:55.949> but<00:04:56.490> who<00:04:56.610> knows

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
bit more further down but who knows

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.400 
bit more further down but who knows
maybe<00:04:57.060> they<00:04:57.210> get<00:04:57.330> distracted<00:04:57.630> by<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:57.990> design

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
maybe they get distracted by the design

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.620 
maybe they get distracted by the design
of<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.800> temple<00:04:59.220> or<00:04:59.370> design<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> cave<00:05:00.449> and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
of the temple or design of the cave and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.170 
of the temple or design of the cave and
not<00:05:01.020> even<00:05:01.289> notice<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.400> walk<00:05:02.669> through<00:05:02.880> here

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
not even notice it so walk through here

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.070 
not even notice it so walk through here
there<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.020> go<00:05:04.139> lights<00:05:04.470> up<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:05.930> one<00:05:06.930> of<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
there you go lights up and one of the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.300 
there you go lights up and one of the
things<00:05:07.139> you<00:05:07.350> could<00:05:07.530> do<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.010> could

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
things you could do is you could

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.120 
things you could do is you could
actually<00:05:08.520> jump<00:05:08.850> over<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:10.289> cannot<00:05:10.620> you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
actually jump over it you cannot you

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.700 
actually jump over it you cannot you
have<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.400> actually<00:05:12.020> run<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.199> jump<00:05:13.380> because<00:05:13.620> if

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
have to actually run and jump because if

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.469 
have to actually run and jump because if
you<00:05:13.770> were<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:14.070> walk<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.490> jump<00:05:14.729> more<00:05:15.210> likely

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
you were to walk and jump more likely

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.850 
you were to walk and jump more likely
you're<00:05:15.810> gonna<00:05:15.870> activate<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.350> tripwire

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
you're gonna activate the tripwire

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.950 
you're gonna activate the tripwire
anyways<00:05:17.370> so<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:17.820> have<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.120> run<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.419> jump<00:05:18.599> so

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
anyways so you have to run and jump so

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.980 
anyways so you have to run and jump so
that<00:05:19.199> it<00:05:19.440> doesn't<00:05:19.620> activate<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.660> like<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.690> said

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
that it doesn't activate and like I said

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.200 
that it doesn't activate and like I said
it's<00:05:22.289> still<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.590> redstone<00:05:23.039> mechanic<00:05:23.639> so<00:05:23.970> I've

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
it's still a redstone mechanic so I've

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.689 
it's still a redstone mechanic so I've
already<00:05:24.389> made<00:05:24.599> this<00:05:24.870> little<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.580> an
