00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
time they didn't have a tool I guess to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
time they didn't have a tool I guess to
drill<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> channel<00:01:32.729> inside<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> body<00:01:33.509> up

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
under the bridge which is how the models

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
under the bridge which is how the models
were<00:01:35.670> later<00:01:35.880> later<00:01:36.329> done<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.900> just

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
were later later done so they just

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
were later later done so they just

the custom shop 1960 I tend to prefer

the custom shop 1960 I tend to prefer
the<00:02:25.350> tone<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.920> bass<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:26.910> reason

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the tone of this bass for some reason

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.860 
the tone of this bass for some reason
the<00:02:28.470> 1960s<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.430> very<00:02:29.670> thick<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.270> works<00:02:30.720> for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the 1960s is very thick it works for

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.479 
the 1960s is very thick it works for
some<00:02:30.930> things<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.370> more

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
some things this is a little more

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.400 
some things this is a little more
versatile<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.030> think<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.390> some<00:02:33.630> ways<00:02:33.810> maybe

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
versatile I think in some ways maybe

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.170 
versatile I think in some ways maybe
because<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.830> round<00:02:35.040> wound<00:02:35.250> strings<00:02:35.580> it's

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
because of the round wound strings it's

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.380 
because of the round wound strings it's
