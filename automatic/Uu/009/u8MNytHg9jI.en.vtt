00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.009
 hello everybody , a facebook partnership 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 with the Brazilian government what is this 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:33.629
 well the Brazilian government closed partnership 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.989
 with the internet program point org 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 facebook that aims to bring cheap internet 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.789
 or free to several people in our 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 country that is for low - income 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.730
 this project aims to bring the internet to 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.500
 this public but not a free internet 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 an internet with programmed content 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.100
 limited 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 You can not use it to access 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 any site in education website theory 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 health and some things like that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.979
 of course facebook and what the mark 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.049
 zuckeberg wins by reducing the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 taxes for him wanting us is a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.970
 social project improves his name right 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 to the shareholders and the market itself. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.049
 after all, social projects are 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.640
 always well seen by the media to dilma 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.520
 help and of course increase the public 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.920
 of facebook it is obvious that facebook 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 is enabled to access 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 I'm using the right system 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 the system is still for regions that have already 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.469
 access to the Internet, but 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.750
 more limited form where there is already 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.290
 Internet infrastructure right but 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.000
 It also aims to access places where 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 Internet access 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.610
 then we only have to wait is the sea that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.070
 will do a little visit that in our 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.180
 country to talk a little bit more 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.180
 about the subject 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.400
 right at the most continue to pay the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.390
 internet is the best thing you do 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 OK 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.560
 a big hug and until the next 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.560

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.870
