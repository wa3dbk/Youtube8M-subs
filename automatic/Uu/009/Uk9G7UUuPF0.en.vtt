was a little on the fence about this

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.750 
was a little on the fence about this
song<00:01:06.320> when<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.590> first<00:01:06.800> started<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.400> wasn't

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
really too sure if I liked it or not but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.740 
really too sure if I liked it or not but
by<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.979> end<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.430> was<00:01:10.520> really<00:01:10.880> into<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:11.479> you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
opens up the whole picture and it really

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.050 
opens up the whole picture and it really
takes<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.409> in<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.159> modern<00:01:16.610> Jesus

starts<00:01:17.360> off<00:01:17.510> with<00:01:17.630> us<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:17.960> had<00:01:18.080> kind<00:01:18.260> of<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
starts off with us we had kind of a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.410 
starts off with us we had kind of a
keyboard<00:01:18.950> riff<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.550> almost<00:01:19.700> sounds<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.180> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
keyboard riff that almost sounds like it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.570 
keyboard riff that almost sounds like it
was<00:01:20.540> lifted<00:01:20.900> from<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.170> mid<00:01:21.470> 90s<00:01:21.920> video<00:01:22.310> game

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
was lifted from a mid 90s video game

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.370 
was lifted from a mid 90s video game
soundtrack<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:23.630> thing<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:23.900> like<00:01:24.110> about<00:01:24.140> this

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
soundtrack one thing I like about this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.200 
soundtrack one thing I like about this
song<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.220> chorus<00:01:25.610> has<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.000> really

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
song is the chorus has this really

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.510 
song is the chorus has this really
anthemic<00:01:26.840> kind<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.320> feel<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:28.100> that's

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
anthemic kind of feel to it and that's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.550 
anthemic kind of feel to it and that's
really<00:01:28.630> contrasted<00:01:29.630> by<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.810> verses<00:01:30.380> with

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
really contrasted by the verses with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.440 
really contrasted by the verses with
that<00:01:30.770> keyboard<00:01:31.040> riff<00:01:31.430> playing<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:32.030> it's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
that keyboard riff playing and it's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.270 
that keyboard riff playing and it's
really<00:01:32.510> common<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.350> verses<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.920> really

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
really common in the verses and really

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.370 
really common in the verses and really
pumps<00:01:34.850> up<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.000> energy<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.690> chorus<00:01:36.080> it's

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
pumps up the energy in the chorus it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.260 
pumps up the energy in the chorus it's
very<00:01:36.860> effective<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.520> delivering<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.090> message

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
very effective in delivering the message

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.060 
very effective in delivering the message
of<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.630> song<00:01:38.900> that's<00:01:39.200> almost<00:01:39.440> like<00:01:39.560> telling<00:01:40.010> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
of the song that's almost like telling a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.040 
of the song that's almost like telling a
joke<00:01:40.340> where<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.790> verses<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:41.810> this

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
joke where the verses are like this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.110

through several different changes in
movements<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.070> my<00:03:15.160> favorite<00:03:15.520> one<00:03:15.640> is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
movements and my favorite one is

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.100 
movements and my favorite one is
actually<00:03:15.910> towards<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> end<00:03:16.660> when<00:03:16.810> there's

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
actually towards the end when there's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.290 
actually towards the end when there's
this<00:03:17.260> piano<00:03:17.800> playing<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.850> just<00:03:19.060> sort<00:03:19.210> of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
this piano playing and it just sort of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.090 
this piano playing and it just sort of
builds<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> thing<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.620> stuck<00:03:20.920> out

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
builds up and the thing that stuck out

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.830 
builds up and the thing that stuck out
to<00:03:21.160> me<00:03:21.310> on<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.700> song<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.060> particular<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
to me on this song in particular was the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200 
to me on this song in particular was the
guitar<00:03:23.170> work<00:03:23.380> towards<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.950> end<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.280> really

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
guitar work towards the end is really

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.150 
guitar work towards the end is really
nice<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.780> really<00:03:26.020> fits<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.530> song<00:03:26.770> as<00:03:26.980> well

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
nice and it really fits the song as well

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.920 
nice and it really fits the song as well
it<00:03:27.490> starts<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.910> build<00:03:28.000> up<00:03:28.210> into<00:03:28.660> what<00:03:28.840> you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it starts to build up into what you

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.630 
it starts to build up into what you
think<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> climax<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.490> it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
think is going to be a climax but it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.460 
think is going to be a climax but it
just<00:03:30.910> stops<00:03:31.270> all<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.780> sudden<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.290> it's

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
just stops all of a sudden and it's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.050 
just stops all of a sudden and it's
really<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:32.770> kind<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.280> pulling<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:33.850> of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
really just kind of pulling you out of

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.420 
really just kind of pulling you out of
the<00:03:34.300> song<00:03:34.540> immediately<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:35.740> really<00:03:36.190> weird

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
the song immediately it's really weird

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.160 
the song immediately it's really weird
and<00:03:36.640> really<00:03:37.000> hard<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:37.360> get<00:03:37.480> used<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.900> when<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
and really hard to get used to when it

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.350 
and really hard to get used to when it
just<00:03:38.380> stops<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> thought<00:03:40.270> it

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
just stops like that but I thought it

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.270 
just stops like that but I thought it
was<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.510> really<00:03:40.750> effective<00:03:41.260> way<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.680> end<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
was a really effective way to end the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.860 
was a really effective way to end the
album<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:42.910> kind<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.210> perfect<00:03:43.690> way<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
album and it kind of a perfect way to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.890 
album and it kind of a perfect way to
end<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.260> album<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:45.010> each<00:03:45.940> song<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.870> very

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
end the album because each song is very

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.230 
end the album because each song is very
different<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:47.890> has<00:03:48.580> all<00:03:48.850> these<00:03:48.880> different

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
different and has all these different

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.000 
different and has all these different
movements<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.990> it<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.350> production<00:03:50.770> on<00:03:50.860> this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
movements to it the production on this

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.890 
movements to it the production on this
album<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.520> really<00:03:51.730> well<00:03:52.000> done<00:03:52.030> there's<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.630> lot

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
album is really well done there's a lot

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900 
album is really well done there's a lot
of<00:03:52.930> different<00:03:53.410> elements<00:03:53.800> going<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.520> a<00:03:54.880> lot

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
of different elements going on and a lot

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.000 
of different elements going on and a lot
of<00:03:55.120> different<00:03:55.380> psychedelic<00:03:56.380> sounds<00:03:56.860> and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
of different psychedelic sounds and

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.680 
of different psychedelic sounds and
things<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.550> balancing<00:03:58.330> all<00:03:58.540> of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
things like that so balancing all of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.150 
things like that so balancing all of
that<00:03:58.870> can<00:03:59.080> be<00:03:59.140> kind<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.530> tricky<00:03:59.590> but<00:04:00.040> they

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
that can be kind of tricky but they

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.860 
that can be kind of tricky but they
managed<00:04:00.490> to<00:04:00.520> pull<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:00.880> off<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.360> well<00:04:01.480> I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
managed to pull it off really well I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.390 
managed to pull it off really well I
really<00:04:02.200> like<00:04:02.350> this<00:04:02.530> album<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
really like this album and I think the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.430 
really like this album and I think the
reason<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.760> like<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.180> because<00:04:04.300> each<00:04:04.870> song<00:04:05.260> is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
reason I like it is because each song is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.220 
reason I like it is because each song is
pretty<00:04:05.590> self-contained<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.760> each<00:04:07.480> song<00:04:07.900> kind

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
pretty self-contained and each song kind

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.990 
pretty self-contained and each song kind
of<00:04:08.350> has<00:04:08.500> all<00:04:08.740> these<00:04:08.890> different<00:04:09.130> movements<00:04:09.850> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
of has all these different movements and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.690 
of has all these different movements and
different<00:04:10.390> tempo<00:04:11.320> changes<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.040> key<00:04:12.190> changes

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
different tempo changes and key changes

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.400 
different tempo changes and key changes
and<00:04:12.880> everything<00:04:13.240> like<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.230> really

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
and everything like that that it really

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.200 
and everything like that that it really
keeps<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.800> interested<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.550> engaged<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.150> you

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
keeps you interested and engaged and you

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.910 
keeps you interested and engaged and you
really<00:04:16.510> don't<00:04:16.660> know<00:04:16.870> what<00:04:17.080> to<00:04:17.109> expect<00:04:17.650> next

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
really don't know what to expect next

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680 
really don't know what to expect next
