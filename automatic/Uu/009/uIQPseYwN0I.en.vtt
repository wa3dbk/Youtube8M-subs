00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
to get it one of them is actually in a

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.830 
to get it one of them is actually in a
plane<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.120> shoot<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> plane<00:02:30.629> out<00:02:30.810> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
plane you have to shoot the plane out of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.809 
plane you have to shoot the plane out of
sky<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> falls<00:02:31.860> down<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.400> pick<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.610> up

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
sky and it falls down and you pick it up

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.390 
sky and it falls down and you pick it up
there<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.660> only<00:02:33.900> see<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> plane<00:02:34.709> when

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
there now you only see the plane when

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
there now you only see the plane when
the<00:02:35.580> environment<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.540> dynamic<00:02:36.750> map<00:02:37.500> effects

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the environment the dynamic map effects

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.630 
the environment the dynamic map effects
which<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.000> do<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.540> enjoy<00:02:40.489> when<00:02:41.489> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
which I really do not enjoy when the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
which I really do not enjoy when the
dynamic<00:02:42.120> map<00:02:42.269> effects<00:02:42.989> turn<00:02:43.200> into<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
dynamic map effects turn into like a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.350 
dynamic map effects turn into like a
stormy<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.250> doesn't<00:02:44.610> turn<00:02:44.700> into<00:02:44.849> snow<00:02:45.239> it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
stormy it doesn't turn into snow it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.119 
stormy it doesn't turn into snow it
changes<00:02:45.690> from<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> snow<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.349> storm<00:02:46.709> there

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
changes from the snow to the storm there

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.470 
changes from the snow to the storm there
should<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> glowing<00:02:47.819> plane<00:02:48.030> shoot<00:02:48.269> at<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
should be a glowing plane shoot at the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
should be a glowing plane shoot at the
plane<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> it'll<00:02:49.440> drop<00:02:49.590> something<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.069> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
plane and it'll drop something to the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.770 
plane and it'll drop something to the
ground<00:02:51.200> anyways<00:02:52.200> these<00:02:52.530> robots<00:02:53.480> take<00:02:54.480> the

they<00:03:40.739> kind<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.069> forced<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> transit<00:03:41.970> effect

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
they kind of forced the transit effect

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.539 
they kind of forced the transit effect
on<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> which<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.019> don't<00:03:43.080> like<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.769> whatever
