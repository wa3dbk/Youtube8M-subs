 relatively small 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.269

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.469
 race car 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.469
 last time 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.439
 in a three hour race on the ring of him 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.079
 whether she will succeed vietnam 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.329
 started performing in the race 18 years 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.069
 At first it was the race years later 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.119
 spoke at the european championship and 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.979
 still today involving 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:45.740
 buses 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.250
 for example to germany championship 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.000
 long distance racing which 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.570
 runs mainly on the ring 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.570
 nurburgring on the north loop 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.979
 when the ball is so because of the fact that I 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.959
 involved in auto racing I can feel 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.469
 autodrome already when designing when 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.229
 he exists only on paper 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.469
 I feel twists and turns 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.999
 and which are laid in a beautiful dream 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.179
 actually we want to build a race track 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.179
 who have 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.489
 so to create an interesting track 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.949
 Smolensk Athens Architectural Bureau 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.779
 I had to think again 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.959
 users are interactive 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.219
 tsr program what we really liked 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.289
 and to some extent helped 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.279
 so this is the topography of the land f 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.709
 nissan so here managed to create 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.209
 really interesting situation 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.949
 is said 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.009
 here we have the finish line starts 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.480
 straight with space 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.900
 sufficient for a large number 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.900
 cars of all fund 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.759
 this time you are the most interesting twist 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.799
 for me 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.489
 and I want to feel it 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.769
 close it will be really soon 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.239
 here the car will be strong 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.399
 shift 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.559
 it is really very very 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.679
 interesting 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.009
 every penny 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.339
 by the way all 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.579
 and it is important 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.129
 as the cost of giant projects 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:18.019
 a discount 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.759
 is about a quarter of a billion 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.549
 dollars 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.330
 cornering elements are always in advance 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.159
 checked on computer 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.619
 Smolensk already has different parts of the route 

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:28.069
 at the design stage too 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.339
 were tested with their own 

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:30.619
 computer programs 

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:31.639
 modeling 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.370
 were designed for brake item 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.680
 cornering speed 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.469
 legal euro 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.929
 book camber we can simulate 

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:43.389
 the speed of the car at each site will be 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.049
 including if the driver commits 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:47.949
 the mistake was killed by cars and 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.819
 technical defect solomatin from 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.289
 turns 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.939
 how much time and place it takes to 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.029
 stop the car 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.129
 here so we have a very congress 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.919
 interesting often tass 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.529
 then we were not given we have the opportunity for 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.150
 overtaking a cube however there are several 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.150
 examples 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.229
 so followed by close 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.259
 turns in October you can slow down 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 among really be solved 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.979
 we have some more very 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.139
 fast turns on the track 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.550
 they are further distinguished by a drop 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.439
 heights 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.610
 so it will be very very difficult to pass 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.449
 twist unmistakably spouse blog 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.460
 big advantage of his race track 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.849
 used for counter-emergency 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.159
 preparation 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.169
 However, I will not give the object our task 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.930
 consisted of partisans 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.900
 allowing you to use the track and 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.410
 as a center of emergency communications 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.150
 club driver training scheduled 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.139
 additional facilities which 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.430
 will be added to the second turn 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.589
 construction 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.089
 the track itself can be divided into 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.149
 several parts so small areas 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.589
 can be used specifically for 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.589
 emergency response training 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.210
 different track configurations 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.370
 it turns out due to reductions 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.800
 therefore we have the opportunity 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.490
 divide the track into different sections and 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.360
 get different in this way 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.360
 options 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.659
 here for example we have a small 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.620
 Plot that perfectly possible 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.400
 use for emergency call 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.099
 training or for training in young 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.559
 riders 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.620
 then has a longer length 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.440
 which can be used 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440
 regardless of the other 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.759
 This option is already part of the brand 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.759
 home stretch 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.369
 or you can use the common 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.429
 distance of 3 and 3 dozen kilometers 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.479
 which contain all possible options 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.809
 fast 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:53.550
 and slow corners 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.800
 such areas for overtaking 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 but like real race tracks 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:01.699
 it will be exclusively 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.509
 interesting track 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.110
 I would be very happy if I could too 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.389
 once on not drive 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.349
