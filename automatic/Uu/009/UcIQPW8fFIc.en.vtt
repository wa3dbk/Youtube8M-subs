 the first holes 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.580
 a lot to do so for one

 medieval schumacher the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.690
 the shoes of course in pure 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.330
 each piece was handmade 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.470
 Made to order a single piece this 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.989
 hour to pick up soon 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.519
 the sole is already cut now 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.890
 the cobbler still has the upper leather 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.379
 Arrest and take the shoe inside 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 turn outside 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.290
 the shoemaker possessed life 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.479
 their workshops often too 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.490
 salons employees and 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.409
 apprentices a lucrative business 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.390
 because the need for shoes was in 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.640
 middle ages huge as they are not 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 a farmer kept a healthy diet for a long time 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.810
 for example, ordered in a year 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.650
 say more than 100 pairs of shoes 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 medieval writings 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.420
 who can afford no new shoes 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 could bring his old treten to 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 flick cobbler 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 He only took care of the mending 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.860
 and repair 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.140
 the medieval footwear was 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.180
 surprisingly diverse there were boots 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.760
 gloves and fashionable 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.800
 beak shoes apart from the size 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.770
 Be men women and children shoes 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.090
 almost equal and on the shoe recognized 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.640
 one also the social one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.710
 his bearer so beautiful bronze 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.789
 as a closure could only buckles 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.789
 to afford someone with money 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.500
 a special feature of the medieval 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.019
 This so-called triple a shoe work 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.369
 Type surplus easily in the wood they were 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.290
 a lot and often worn 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.989
 whether in the countryside or in the city almost 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.849
 all roads were then as unpaved around 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.069
 the delicate leather shoes against wetness 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.930
 and to protect dirt hatched one 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.540
 just put in and tied the third 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.370
 with leather straps it had to be nice 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.049
 So not the shoe work but 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.940
 as appropriate at least in 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.440
 rural areas and villages where the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.440
 people had to work a lot 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.410
 You knew then lined shoes 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.570

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.640
