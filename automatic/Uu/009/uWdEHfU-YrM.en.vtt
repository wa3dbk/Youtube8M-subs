00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 interview with nac player of singers 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.430
 known site in brazil the world that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.400
 now it 's back there the scene together 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.990
 with ags acabe steam united states 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.180
 at first he tells you what you did 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:31.189
 All this time , the past 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.510
 back scenario 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 so I stopped playing at seven points 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.070
 and in 2012 if I was not mistaken I played from 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 2001 was already 11 years playing in the sesi 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 competitive in 2012 when it was in a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.510
 time he's already a little weak already 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.879
 no longer had the championship had 12 in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 test per year and I was finishing the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 college did is advertising college 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 so I decided to stop and leave me 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.770
 totally deleted advertising and I started 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.510
 to do internship in 2012 and even 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.330
 now last month in 2015 I was 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.240
 working in advertising agencies and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.710
 playing seventh time or another I just came back 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 now play the goal site doing 2 months 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.450
 this opportunity has now arisen 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.150
 how koff as that opportunity is 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 a different charge no one playing is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 How do you expect this new chance? 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.159
 to act in a different function than 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.159
 you are accustomed 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 I think it's a challenge that I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.799
 I'm accepting for myself, I've never been a coach or 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.120
 took care of the tactical part already in the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.880
 playable was captain 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.210
 also you already have a part to play 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920
 It's a part that I like but I think 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.360
 it will be difficult to sit down and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.010
 play is going to be great 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.750
 Just like that when I was I decided 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.570
 come back because I believed that I 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.220
 was I still had something 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.050
 offer process and with everything I already 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 I went through each and everyone wanted me 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.310
 I had and at the same time the Flemish team 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.070
 I was needing someone behind them. 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.380
 to give all support out of the game 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 besides supporting the rate but also the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.640
 training organization team schedule 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.630
 who is in training as they will 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 organize to train with the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 opponents out there so that everything already 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.540
 I spent a lot so I already know how it does 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.820
 get organized well then look what I think 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.770
 that will be an easy adaptation 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.750
 Only I 'm so anxious, I was back on track. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.680
 that the championship now place underneath 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.990
 playing in the omip area here and you 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.090
 lived the golden times while the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.880
 site not 1.6 or championships 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.130
 international 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.010
 in this new version still the cs go west 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 You think you have chance to come back and have it 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.510
 the same importance as the price at which 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.780
 in the past 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.880
 difficult to compare or at that time the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.120
 nowadays because at that time the sex 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.790
 was a good so great at home on account 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.890
 of lan houses and nowadays does not see 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.600
 more so then in that whole Catholic 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.140
 world to play everyone - you've heard 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.650
 talk about 7 different times but 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.470
 certainly within the world of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.709
 games the sef goal will have the same 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.269
 importance of what a concept this year 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.580
 already showed this with all the athletes who 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.780
 are happening that happened here 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.530
 will happen if you put 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.050
 side 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.190
 the greatness of the sesi goal is much greater than 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.640
 than the concept on account of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.810
 sponsorship by company 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.870
 teams that are with a pigtail with 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.470
 teams that are a game on alves then 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.379
 I think the back is going to be even bigger 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.000
 It's what everyone expects is the sport. 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.590
 in general has grown because 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.819
 I used to have more in the meantime. 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.680
 here in Brazil, right? 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.730
 nowadays it has reflex in other games 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.930
 who thinks he's got this opportunity 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.659
 other modalities also appearing 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.569
 within the sport is also accompanied by 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.280
 other games there like all the 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.739
 accompanied and followed quite soon 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.160
 I think what else accompanies taking cf 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:27.410
 and I do not even need to talk is the size 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.889
 of the gigantic public coup is absurd 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.750
 big and the cs and in Brazil at the time that 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.199
 it is popular advice was very 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.240
 great also I think even public 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.800
 is in place on time when it started in 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.650
 that access is coming back the bicheiro 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.120
 step six giant stars and will have 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.410
 I think you have the chance to come back with the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.080
 same force that the front of a beat 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.960
 branch of the public hence why 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.970
 next steps of the team is to leave the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.820
 Brazil, here you are going to participate. 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.250
 How does the team's agenda 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.870
 now the wines are on vacation here at 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.240
 Brazil waiting a little while because 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.510
 Arrived stayed in 4 to 5 months out there 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.610
 They came back here on Friday vacation. 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.700
 now August 7 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.610
 We're going to Germany where to start the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.860
 preparatory boutique to play Mr. 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.139
 I would like to say that it is the 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.110
 main championship of the year which is the 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.180
 most important championship and from there 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.639
 People come back with the United States to 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.129
 begin 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.409
 of the deficit it is normal again to be more 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.180
 three months probably gives 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.409
 time to stay three months we will go 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.789
 For Europe to help another championship 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.409
 that in romania 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.020
 I think we have to indicate stay 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.460
 even more the big chance is great and 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.560
 there will be present certain 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.539
 season any expectation the 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.400
 growth is still the top teams 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.840
 of the world 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.740
 the team is prepared to face 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.120
 This challenge I think we changed. 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.490
 time now, right? 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.550
 I think I like this change. 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.699
 the whole new disease is won. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.439
 a new excitement we'll train 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.479
 there in Germany ends positive Europeans 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.830
 they are the best so in expectation it is 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:14.129
 big and I think if it came a top3 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.169
 already a good size 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.849
 who this interview in what is now 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.279
 coaching and team 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.990
 nominally and Brazilian who needs to 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.960
 North American organization will compete 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.770
 in the main country 71 championships 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.770
 brigade 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.300
