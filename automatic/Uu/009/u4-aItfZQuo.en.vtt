00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
technology kind of surfaced and my own

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
technology kind of surfaced and my own
personal<00:00:30.330> knowledge<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.810> things<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> how<00:00:31.769> to

personal knowledge of things and how to
make<00:00:32.040> things<00:00:32.160> more<00:00:32.399> efficient<00:00:33.469> grew<00:00:34.760> so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
make things more efficient grew so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.290 
make things more efficient grew so
rather<00:00:36.239> than<00:00:36.510> continue<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.170> making<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:38.300> series

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
rather than continue on making a series

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
rather than continue on making a series
that<00:00:39.329> had<00:00:40.260> old<00:00:40.469> technology<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> wanted<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that had old technology and it wanted to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
that had old technology and it wanted to
start<00:00:42.210> fresh<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.190> here

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
start fresh and that's what we have here

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
start fresh and that's what we have here
so<00:00:45.090> let's<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.110> we're<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so let's talk about what we're going to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
so let's talk about what we're going to
do<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> series<00:00:47.039> obviously<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.360> going

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
do in this series obviously we're going

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.709 
do in this series obviously we're going
to<00:00:48.510> build<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> website<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.420> with<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> website

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to build a website and with that website

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
to build a website and with that website
we're<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> build<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.469> front-end<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.070> what

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
we're going to build a front-end or what

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
we're going to build a front-end or what
the<00:00:54.030> public<00:00:54.420> sees<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> backend<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the public sees and then the backend and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
the public sees and then the backend and
it's<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.480> dynamically<00:00:58.020> edit<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's what we use to dynamically edit the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's what we use to dynamically edit the
website<00:00:59.660> might<00:01:00.660> call<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.020> admin<00:01:01.410> panel<00:01:01.680> or

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
website might call it an admin panel or

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
website might call it an admin panel or
a<00:01:02.309> control<00:01:02.730> panel<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.390> something<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
a control panel or something like that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
a control panel or something like that
now<00:01:04.589> we'll<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.159> some<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
now we'll take a look at some of the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.510 
now we'll take a look at some of the
tools<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> use<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:08.130> far<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
tools we're going to use as far as the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130 
tools we're going to use as far as the
languages<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> learn<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:10.110> learn

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
languages we're going to learn we learn

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
languages we're going to learn we learn
two<00:01:10.530> types<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> languages<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.720> client-side

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
two types of languages the client-side

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
two types of languages the client-side
languages<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> server-side<00:01:14.010> languages

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
languages and the server-side languages

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.690 
languages and the server-side languages
now<00:01:15.630> client-side<00:01:16.439> languages<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.490> are

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
now client-side languages these are

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630 
now client-side languages these are
loaded<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.270> browser<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.340> when<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> user
