kind of like a game trading marketplace

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
kind of like a game trading marketplace
rather<00:00:38.820> than<00:00:39.090> buying<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.480> selling<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> list

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
rather than buying or selling you list

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.209 
rather than buying or selling you list
games<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.600> on-site<00:00:42.989> currency<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> then

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
games for the on-site currency and then

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
games for the on-site currency and then
other<00:00:44.370> people<00:00:44.670> buy<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> games<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.690> their<00:00:45.930> on

other people buy the games with their on
side<00:00:46.320> currency<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
side currency so you're basically just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
side currency so you're basically just
trading<00:00:48.420> games<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.809> games<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> similar<00:00:49.440> value

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I thought this was really cool because

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.250 
I thought this was really cool because
it<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> directly<00:00:53.910> trade<00:00:54.300> games<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.140> other

it was to directly trade games and other

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
it was to directly trade games and other
gamers<00:00:55.559> rather<00:00:55.980> than<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
gamers rather than going through like a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990 
gamers rather than going through like a
middleman<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.570> gamestop<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.879> know

you're getting a game back rather than

that<00:02:41.640> came<00:02:41.790> before<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.330> because<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.080> such

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that came before this because it's such

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.860 
that came before this because it's such
a<00:02:43.410> huge<00:02:43.950> mess<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:44.760> Activision<00:02:45.570> really

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
a huge mess because Activision really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.960 
a huge mess because Activision really
rushed<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.530> release<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.490> heard<00:02:47.790> that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
rushed it for release and I heard that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.180 
rushed it for release and I heard that
this<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.360> had<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.840> similar<00:02:49.230> development<00:02:49.980> hell

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
this one had a similar development hell

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.250 
this one had a similar development hell
so<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:51.120> hoping<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:51.720> will<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.840> lots<00:02:52.050> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
so I'm hoping that there will be lots of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.570 
so I'm hoping that there will be lots of
game<00:02:52.410> breaking<00:02:52.560> glitches<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.280> glitches<00:02:53.460> that

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
game breaking glitches and glitches that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.710 
game breaking glitches and glitches that
will<00:02:53.790> launch<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.090> car

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
will launch my car

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
will launch my car
60<00:02:55.080> feet<00:02:55.230> into<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> air<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.490> I'm<00:02:56.580> really

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
60 feet into the air so I'm really

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
60 feet into the air so I'm really
looking<00:02:57.060> forward<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.330> trying<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.020> I

haven't yet but I'm really hoping it's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260 
haven't yet but I'm really hoping it's
just<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.350> glitch<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> last<00:03:02.070> game<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
just this glitch is the last game and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.090

is the game that I've always wanted to

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.720 
is the game that I've always wanted to
try<00:04:13.200> because<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.770> looks<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> game<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:14.550> would

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
try because it looks like a game I would

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.970 
try because it looks like a game I would
have<00:04:14.850> really<00:04:15.150> enjoyed<00:04:15.270> as<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.630> kid<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.440> stores

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
it was always like $30 or more and I

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.720 
it was always like $30 or more and I
thought<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.799> was<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:20.130> bit<00:04:20.370> too<00:04:20.549> much

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
thought that was a little bit too much

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.090 
thought that was a little bit too much
for<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.030> game<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.330> only<00:04:21.510> kind<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.350> wanted<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.800> play

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100

rare because a lot of people felt like

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.170 
rare because a lot of people felt like
me<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:31.920> didn't<00:04:32.310> want<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.550> pay<00:04:32.670> full<00:04:32.850> price<00:04:32.910> for

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
aren't a lot of copies floating around

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.600 
aren't a lot of copies floating around
but<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.890> first<00:04:38.070> game<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.490> this

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
but this is the first game in this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.700 
but this is the first game in this
series<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.750> actually<00:04:39.900> did<00:04:40.230> try<00:04:40.410> this<00:04:40.470> one

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
series and I actually did try this one

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.160 
series and I actually did try this one
out<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.070> this<00:04:42.000> really<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> game<00:04:42.660> for<00:04:42.960> young

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
out and this really is a game for young

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.720 
out and this really is a game for young
kids<00:04:43.410> but<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:43.890> doesn't<00:04:44.280> really<00:04:44.370> make<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.610> a

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
kids but that doesn't really make it a

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.820 
kids but that doesn't really make it a
bad<00:04:44.970> game<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:45.810> means<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.440> audience

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
bad game it just means that the audience

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.560 
bad game it just means that the audience
for<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.160> is<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.310> little<00:04:47.640> bit<00:04:47.760> smaller<00:04:48.120> than<00:04:48.240> most

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
for it is a little bit smaller than most

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.930 
for it is a little bit smaller than most
mainstream<00:04:48.840> games<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.620> still<00:04:50.460> enjoy<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
mainstream games I still enjoy it a

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.320 
mainstream games I still enjoy it a
little<00:04:51.180> bit<00:04:51.420> even<00:04:52.170> as<00:04:52.290> an<00:04:52.440> adult<00:04:52.680> but<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
little bit even as an adult but the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.550 
little bit even as an adult but the
controls<00:04:54.960> are<00:04:55.350> really<00:04:55.770> bad<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:57.440> started<00:04:58.440> just

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
controls are really bad I started just

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.320 
controls are really bad I started just
blend<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.250> being<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.850> Wii<00:05:00.000> and

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
blend this on it being on the Wii and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.290 
the fact that you have to use the Wii
mote<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.190> you're<00:05:02.730> supposed<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.030> hold<00:05:03.180> it

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
mote and you're supposed to hold it

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.540 
mote and you're supposed to hold it
horizontally<00:05:03.480> like<00:05:04.290> an<00:05:04.440> NES<00:05:04.740> controller<00:05:05.190> but

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
horizontally like an NES controller but

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
horizontally like an NES controller but
you're<00:05:05.670> still<00:05:05.880> controlling<00:05:06.390> like<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.870> 3d<00:05:07.380> game

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
you're still controlling like a 3d game

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.159 
you're still controlling like a 3d game
with<00:05:08.400> basically<00:05:08.970> what<00:05:09.210> was<00:05:09.300> designed<00:05:09.630> as<00:05:09.750> a<00:05:09.810> 2d

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
with basically what was designed as a 2d

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.220 
with basically what was designed as a 2d
controller<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.490> there<00:05:12.210> are<00:05:12.300> some<00:05:12.419> issues<00:05:12.630> it's

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
controller so there are some issues it's

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.290 
controller so there are some issues it's
still<00:05:13.500> lots<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:13.830> fun<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.340> think<00:05:14.940> I'm<00:05:15.060> probably

halfway<00:05:15.660> through<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.230> so<00:05:16.380> it's<00:05:16.500> not<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.800> long

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
halfway through it so it's not that long

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.100
