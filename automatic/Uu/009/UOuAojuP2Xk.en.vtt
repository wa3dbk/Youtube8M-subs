00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.470
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.470
 new contest today with john deere 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:21.500
 9750 um it's the metric one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.500
 a meter from john deere costs at the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 murder 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 2005 2050 250.000 euro now have - and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.300
 For this we need a cultivation device 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 Immediately machines here together 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.330
 You can just mow here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 choose among schneidwerk of German 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.050
 everything fits 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790
 I do not know how much in the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.820
 fit summer into it 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.930
 but all this mower I have here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.340
 always lying down more for one are that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.070
 usually bitten if you have the biggest 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.050
 schneider or the most expensive cuts there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 he middle the cheapest is not 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.940
 I want to say but is cheap and yourself 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.920
 negative view of the john deere 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.590
 is a bit pixelated for my taste 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 but at least once again I am a tournament 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 I know I'm a fan of you and of 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.789
 That's why I'm quite right about that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.709
 Excited about getting in trainer 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.830
 wonderful so I do not want that 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.450
 to complain about already instruments 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.789
 better succeeded 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.110
 the whole device can be controlled very much 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:53.119
 very easy, very smooth, I say 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.119
 once with cologna 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.910
 on 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.210
 coupled we can here the normal 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.040
 with the corn picker working with her 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.530
 work together without problems and me 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.770
 then it sounded something and times 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.170
 go out 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.800
 The exterior view can be seen here 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.230
 beautiful sparkle more before the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.300
 Federal shares would be wonderfully bright 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.130
 it is something for them now yeah i say 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 something possible that any I mean 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.260
 the outside view I think if 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:40.010
 Just a cornfield so I am 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 now on the field fold down the first 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:53.130
 Most tailors on most is as well 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.920
 always and you me quickly the whole thing 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.880
 align here 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.960
 then it may actually would 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.960
 already go 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.370
 we 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.490
 we do in a roasting tin with b turn 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.980
 is it going on with the man 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:24.160
 license so you do not enter 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.340
 little sees and the steps from 1 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.660
 more quickly 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.660
 eur 2 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.400
 I think it comes 4 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.170
 and sees the whole thing working 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.410
 actually timeless 28 correct what 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.580
 I did not align properly 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.990
 I just tried the helper 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.580
 but if I help them 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.010
 when i experience the behavior crop and 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.200
 I now turn off the pressure now and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 hired helpers 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 the device simply works and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.880
 whole colossus or the whole metric 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.130
 Of course this is something now 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.460
 handy and maybe something 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.180
 disturbing that's why I would say this 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:21.400
 object what happens now has now 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.910
 not necessarily want my test 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.910
 because somehow it works here 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.910
 with these most I have now 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.680
 once again carried out with the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.010
 normal mower work is once 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.750
 turn it on again 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.750
 pay out metric 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.110
 just still with the helpers and 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.810
 lo and behold it works the whole 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.259
 wonderful again some of them are abroad 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.349
 go 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:05:02.370
 the whole works at least with the 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:05.490
 normal mower here you can also see how 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.779
 The whole wonderful fills very much 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.849
 nicely animated as I think and 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.680
 let's just try one 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.400
 Tractor in case just fast 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.759
 Down says vogler further adjusted 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.110
 Do not go where I'm approaching now 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:32.960
 Now sew with my trailer the 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:35.550
 consider metric steered ok oh so 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.479
 Well, here is no hole that is 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:45.300
 unfortunately from the field so just now 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:48.599
 on the map amber actually misses me 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.600
 then actually would have the tube from 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.530
 Aachen 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.530
 it fast 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.020
 there it comes 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.630
 so 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.920
 I have not solved that yet and 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.240
 there 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.240
 here in precursor 2 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.920
 slowly 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.920
 experienced and 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.110
 the whole thing works then 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.110
 actually quite good is full 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:56.040
 moment is done fit 1018 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.430
 1800 liters 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.820
 that's a little bit I think 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.030
 but looks great on all occasions and 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.990
 I want to say that is for the 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.220
 cereals are quite useful 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.340
 Metric is quite cheap in the 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.340
 acquisition he is very permissive what 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.630
 unfortunately the mowers are not for 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.630
 most suitable ones
