 countries that have the difficulties of 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.239
 water management these standards which you 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.030
 will be fast you can see on 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.720
 shook studs were planted there 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.870
 three weeks 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.519
 shower 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.829
 and it's good to start accessing 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.640
 best for the future 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.760
 in the protection of oases say m 10 m 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.590
 for home gardens we can 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.640
 plant in the house to give them a

 ground sense 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.889
 consume the green pods 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.659
 consumed resources that we stop and we 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.159
 can rent an outcry over dried for 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.040
 recover the seed and make 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:34.599
 the oil from the seed counts 52 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.420
 % of tiles 73 % of oleic acid is 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.209
 a 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.500
 a food oil in the first place this 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.460
 which is important for africa because 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.740
 that's missing here you've read the summary 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.070
 so stp rennet struggling to have some 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.900

 city flight number flight then 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.650
 this is true yes it's a bit like that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.530

 for fodder for animals we 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.870
 have there girls of this relationship with 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.910
 the art the trunk of the tree can be done 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.590
 pulp in some countries

 with the corsophones of the dyes 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.350
 most particular natural ones they 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.490
