yep<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.329> used<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.079> lights

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
yep and I used to think that the lights

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.500 
yep and I used to think that the lights
inside<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.130> was<00:03:53.250> water<00:03:53.579> with<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> light<00:03:54.389> bulb

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
inside it was water with a light bulb

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.360 
inside it was water with a light bulb
because<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.900> was<00:03:54.989> something<00:03:55.139> music<00:03:55.560> has<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> glow

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
because I was something music has a glow

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.640 
because I was something music has a glow
like<00:03:56.900> other<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.139> bulb

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
like other like bulb

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.880 
like other like bulb
I<00:03:58.709> don't<00:03:58.950> know

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
I don't know

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.350 
I don't know
the<00:04:01.010> thing<00:04:01.220> about<00:04:01.250> driving<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.030> used<00:04:02.270> to

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the thing about driving that I used to

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.230 
the thing about driving that I used to
think<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.350> thought<00:04:03.830> that<00:04:03.890> cars<00:04:04.610> like

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
think is that I thought that cars like

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.030 
think is that I thought that cars like
knew<00:04:05.540> where<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.870> wanted<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.230> go<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.800> turn

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
knew where you wanted to go and the turn

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.250 
knew where you wanted to go and the turn
signals<00:04:07.520> work<00:04:07.700> themselves<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.050> turn

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
signals work themselves so like the turn

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.040 
signals work themselves so like the turn
signals<00:04:09.650> would<00:04:09.770> tell<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.130> where<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.340> go<00:04:11.050> don't

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
signals would tell you where to go don't

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.130 
signals would tell you where to go don't
