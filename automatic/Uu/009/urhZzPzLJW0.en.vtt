stay stay on that stand yes it's back up
into<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.389> way<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.569> do<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:42.700> think

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
into it that's the way to do it I think

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.729 
into it that's the way to do it I think
if<00:03:43.790> time<00:03:44.030> runs<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:45.200> person<00:03:45.469> with<00:03:45.590> more

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
if time runs out the person with more

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.740 
if time runs out the person with more
health<00:03:46.010> winds<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.939> are<00:03:47.000> he<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.359> instant

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
health winds that are he just instant

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.539 
health winds that are he just instant
ones<00:03:47.810> most<00:03:48.590> likely<00:03:48.680> he<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.159> sends<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.400> him

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
ones most likely he just sends to him

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.420 
ones most likely he just sends to him
