00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
finally head to Alaska because I have a

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.780 
finally head to Alaska because I have a
theory<00:06:51.390> on<00:06:51.510> that<00:06:51.630> my<00:06:52.200> theory<00:06:52.500> is<00:06:52.650> I<00:06:53.040> think<00:06:53.400> he's

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
theory on that my theory is I think he's

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.330

from<00:06:56.610> there<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.210> maybe<00:06:57.480> challenge<00:06:57.960> him<00:06:58.110> to

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
from there and maybe challenge him to
