all jpeg images now let me demonstrate

all jpeg images now let me demonstrate
what<00:01:14.310> happens<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:16.070> camera<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
what happens when you take a camera and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.999 
what happens when you take a camera and
you<00:01:18.240> take<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.720> other<00:01:18.930> shots<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.619> non

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.920 

now<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.490> difference<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:43.000> time<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.300> I<00:01:43.570> have

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
now the difference this time is I have

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.990 
now the difference this time is I have
the<00:01:44.080> original<00:01:44.440> jpg<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.250> also<00:01:45.610> took<00:01:45.820> a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
the original jpg but I also took a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.420 
the original jpg but I also took a
picture<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.720> raw<00:01:47.260> mode<00:01:47.410> on<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:47.920> camera<00:01:48.190> which

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
picture in raw mode on this camera which

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.810 
picture in raw mode on this camera which
saves<00:01:48.730> it<00:01:48.850> as<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:49.000> nef<00:01:49.540> file<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.580> turn<00:01:51.730> on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
saves it as a nef file when you turn on

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.400 
saves it as a nef file when you turn on
the<00:01:51.910> camera<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.390> first<00:01:52.630> part<00:01:52.900> works<00:01:53.110> exactly

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
the camera the first part works exactly

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.530 
the camera the first part works exactly
the<00:01:53.590> same<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:54.010> comes<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.550> your<00:01:54.850> photo<00:01:55.150> albums

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
the same it comes to your photo albums

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.150 
the same it comes to your photo albums
and<00:01:55.630> automatically<00:01:56.110> loads<00:01:56.350> your<00:01:56.470> camera

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
and automatically loads your camera

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.100 
and automatically loads your camera

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
corner but as you see here it loads up

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.950

just<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.430> JPEG<00:02:03.820> image<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.330> does<00:02:04.510> not<00:02:04.750> even

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
just the JPEG image it does not even

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.300 
just the JPEG image it does not even
recognize<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.770> nef<00:02:06.190> file<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:08.140> select<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
recognize that nef file I can select and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.750 
recognize that nef file I can select and
deselect<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.840> images<00:02:11.490> over<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.640> right

camera unfortunately does not do video
that<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.820> will<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.150> test<00:02:25.480> with

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
that for that I will have to test with

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.380 
that for that I will have to test with
them<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> another<00:02:27.010> device<00:02:27.360> hopefully<00:02:28.360> I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
them with a another device hopefully I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.320 
them with a another device hopefully I
will<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.810> able<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.110> show<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.550> future

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
will be able to show that you in future

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.170 
will be able to show that you in future
videos<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> can<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.340> here<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
videos so as you can see here the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.600 
videos so as you can see here the
honeycomb<00:02:34.830> 3.2<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.610> import<00:02:37.060> jpeg<00:02:37.870> images<00:02:38.610> but

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
honeycomb 3.2 can import jpeg images but

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.880 
honeycomb 3.2 can import jpeg images but
if<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.780> are<00:02:41.020> trying<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.470> something<00:02:41.860> more

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
if you are trying to do something more

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.100 
if you are trying to do something more
sophisticated<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.940> raw<00:02:43.180> images<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.930> will

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
sophisticated like raw images it will

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.540 
sophisticated like raw images it will
not<00:02:44.350> import<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.010> still<00:02:45.760> at<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.180> point
