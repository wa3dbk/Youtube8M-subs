not to be totally honest with you when I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.930 
not to be totally honest with you when I
first<00:00:11.730> thought<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.000> TV<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.410> excited

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
first thought on TV I was so excited

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.090 
first thought on TV I was so excited
because<00:00:14.940> who<00:00:15.360> wouldn't<00:00:15.660> want<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.049> cupcake<00:00:16.260> 25

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
because who wouldn't want a cupcake 25

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.580 
because who wouldn't want a cupcake 25
times<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.670> size<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.330> large<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.199> regular

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
times the size of a large of a regular

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.700 
times the size of a large of a regular
cupcake<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.779> first<00:00:22.020> let<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.230> start<00:00:22.380> off<00:00:22.650> by

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
cupcake so first let me start off by

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.870 
cupcake so first let me start off by
showing<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:23.850> looks<00:00:24.090> like

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
showing you what it actually looks like

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.810 
showing you what it actually looks like
here<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.269> base

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.330 

here<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> top<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> middle

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
here is the top and this is the middle

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
here is the top and this is the middle
and<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.910> would<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.690> top<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and so you would put this on top of the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.139 
and so you would put this on top of the
base<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.250> leave<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.760> space

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
base and it would leave this space

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.660 
base and it would leave this space
hollowed<00:00:42.720> out<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.250> fill<00:00:44.460> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
hollowed out so that you could fill your

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.470 
hollowed out so that you could fill your
cake<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.180> custard<00:00:45.540> or<00:00:46.230> ice<00:00:46.590> cream<00:00:46.649> or

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
cake with custard or ice cream or

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
preserves or anything that you would

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.579 
preserves or anything that you would
like<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.370> fill<00:00:50.699> it<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.379> when

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
like to fill it with and that way when

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.160

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
how cool is that so first let me start

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
how cool is that so first let me start
off<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:58.680> telling<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.159> something<00:00:59.519> I<00:00:59.610> really

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
off by telling you something I really

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.259 
off by telling you something I really
really<00:01:00.420> liked<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.720> it<00:01:01.699> when<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> first<00:01:03.089> saw

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
really liked about it when I first saw

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.210 
really liked about it when I first saw
it<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> TV<00:01:03.659> I<00:01:03.869> was<00:01:04.140> concerned<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.040> was

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it on TV I was concerned because I was

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
it on TV I was concerned because I was
wondering<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.450> cone

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
wondering how it would have that cone

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
wondering how it would have that cone
shape<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> top<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.400> worried<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
shape at the top so I was worried that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
shape at the top so I was worried that
maybe<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.360> wouldn't<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.630> even<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.380> would

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
maybe it wouldn't be even or it would

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.640 
maybe it wouldn't be even or it would
spill<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:10.979> oven<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.270> fortunately<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
spill in my oven but fortunately as you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.090 
spill in my oven but fortunately as you
can<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:15.210> base<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> keeps

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
can see here this base and so it keeps

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
can see here this base and so it keeps
it<00:01:17.340> level<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.000> whenever<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.710> pour<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it level so whenever you would pour in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
it level so whenever you would pour in
your<00:01:20.189> batter<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:21.030> set<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.540> oven<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
your batter or set it in your oven it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
your batter or set it in your oven it
would<00:01:22.950> sit<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.340> level<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.600> wouldn't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
would sit there level and you wouldn't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
would sit there level and you wouldn't
have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> worry<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> spilling<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have to worry about it spilling so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.539 
have to worry about it spilling so
that's<00:01:26.820> great<00:01:27.950> another<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.430> would

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that's great another thing that I would

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
that's great another thing that I would
like<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> share<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> would

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
like to share with you is that you would

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.999 
like to share with you is that you would
have<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> use<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.250> box<00:01:32.610> cake<00:01:32.970> mixes<00:01:34.009> even

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have to use to box cake mixes even

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
have to use to box cake mixes even
though<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.369> only<00:01:35.520> require<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.330> one<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
though it will only require like one in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.950 
though it will only require like one in
two<00:01:37.080> thirds<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:38.850> better<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.600> ahead<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
two thirds it's better to go ahead and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
two thirds it's better to go ahead and
use<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.830> box<00:01:41.040> cake<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> mixes<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.390> then

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
use the to box cake that mixes and then

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
use the to box cake that mixes and then
take<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> excess<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.490> make<00:01:44.640> regular

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
take the excess and just make regular

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
take the excess and just make regular
cupcakes<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.400> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
be filled all the way to the line and so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.469 
be filled all the way to the line and so
you<00:01:51.120> don't<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.780> cupcake<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.680> short

share<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.220> because<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.820> base<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
share with you is because the base is so

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
share with you is because the base is so
much<00:02:00.870> deeper<00:02:01.140> than<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.620> lid<00:02:01.830> they<00:02:02.460> cook<00:02:02.700> at

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
much deeper than the lid they cook at

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.390 
much deeper than the lid they cook at
different<00:02:02.880> weights<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.010> keep<00:02:05.220> an

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
different weights and so just keep an

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.149 
different weights and so just keep an
eye<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.479> lid<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.350> make<00:02:07.710> sure<00:02:07.920> you're

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
eye on the lid and make sure you're

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.249 
eye on the lid and make sure you're
poking<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.060> fork<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.049> can

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
poking it with a fork so that you can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.710 
poking it with a fork so that you can
take<00:02:10.409> it<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.269> guarantee<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.299> it's<00:02:12.629> going

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
take it out I guarantee that it's going

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.890 
take it out I guarantee that it's going
to<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> come<00:02:13.440> out<00:02:13.590> before<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.400> base<00:02:14.900> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to have to come out before the base but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
to have to come out before the base but
I<00:02:15.959> just<00:02:16.290> wanted<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> tell<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.220> cuz<00:02:18.060> I
