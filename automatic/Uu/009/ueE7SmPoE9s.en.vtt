use<00:01:37.590> mainly<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> two

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
use mainly because it was one of the two

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
use mainly because it was one of the two
starter<00:01:39.659> weapons<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> didn't<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
starter weapons that you didn't have to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.399 
starter weapons that you didn't have to
work<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> get<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> along

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
work for it all to get that is along

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
work for it all to get that is along
with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> spaz<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> scar<00:01:44.520> definitely

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
with the spaz but the scar definitely

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.190 
with the spaz but the scar definitely
had<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.240> advantages<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> spaz<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
had some advantages over the spaz and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
had some advantages over the spaz and
really<00:01:49.200> obvious<00:01:49.500> ones<00:01:49.680> first<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
really obvious ones first of all the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.190 
really obvious ones first of all the
scar<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> definitely<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> far<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
scar is definitely one of the far one of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
scar is definitely one of the far one of
the<00:01:52.259> most<00:01:52.350> versatile<00:01:52.829> weapons<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> entire

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the most versatile weapons in the entire

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.630 
the most versatile weapons in the entire
game<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.840> super<00:01:55.229> good<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.799> close<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.520> only

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
game it's super good up close it only

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
game it's super good up close it only
takes<00:01:56.909> five<00:01:57.630> shots<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.290> an<00:01:58.380> unarmored<00:01:58.770> target

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
takes five shots to an unarmored target

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
takes five shots to an unarmored target
if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.549> both<00:01:59.759> ballistics<00:02:00.299> focus<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
if you have both ballistics focus and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.850 
if you have both ballistics focus and
ballistics<00:02:01.409> improvement<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.189> kill

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
ballistics improvement on to get a kill

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
ballistics improvement on to get a kill
it's<00:02:04.860> rapid<00:02:05.280> fire<00:02:05.549> hip<00:02:06.509> firing<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.990> rather

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's rapid fire hip firing it's rather

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
it's rapid fire hip firing it's rather
accurate<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> definitely<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.119> crazy<00:02:09.569> up

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
accurate so definitely it's crazy up

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.800 
accurate so definitely it's crazy up

most used gun still because of how

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.680 
most used gun still because of how
versatile<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:46.170> um<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:48.040> for<00:02:49.030> other<00:02:49.180> well

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
versatile it is um as for other well

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.470 
versatile it is um as for other well
used<00:02:49.930> guns<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
used guns because that's what the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.570 
used guns because that's what the
metagame<00:02:52.720> describes<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.950> most<00:02:54.160> highly<00:02:54.430> used

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
metagame describes the most highly used

metagame describes the most highly used
stuff<00:02:55.049> you're<00:02:56.049> going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.260> see<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> lot<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.560> hive

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
stuff you're going to see a lot of hive

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.789 
stuff you're going to see a lot of hive
cannons<00:02:57.280> when<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.519> like<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.940> with<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.239> and

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
cannons when you like on with you and

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.550 
cannons when you like on with you and
for<00:02:59.799> good<00:02:59.950> reason<00:03:00.400> because<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.910> hive<00:03:01.090> cannon

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
for good reason because the hive cannon

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.620 
for good reason because the hive cannon
it<00:03:02.560> has<00:03:02.709> 100<00:03:03.099> shots<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.580> clip<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.180> reload

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
it has 100 shots to a clip it's reload

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.059 
it has 100 shots to a clip it's reload
is<00:03:04.780> super<00:03:05.080> fast<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.500> right<00:03:05.650> there<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.890> have<00:03:05.980> an

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
is super fast so right there you have an

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.670 
is super fast so right there you have an
LMG<00:03:06.519> basically<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.840> can<00:03:08.080> be<00:03:08.200> reloaded

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
LMG basically that can be reloaded

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.600 
LMG basically that can be reloaded
rather<00:03:08.980> quickly<00:03:09.340> um<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.769> going<00:03:12.549> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
rather quickly um it's it's going to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.190 
rather quickly um it's it's going to
kill<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.030> ten<00:03:13.239> shots<00:03:13.599> if<00:03:13.989> you're

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
kill you in ten shots if you're

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.460 
kill you in ten shots if you're
unarmored<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:16.470> focus

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
unarmored and and you have focus

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.810 
unarmored and and you have focus
ballistics<00:03:17.920> focus<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.430> listings

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
ballistics focus and listings

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.060 
ballistics focus and listings
improvement<00:03:19.239> on<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.230> means<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.829> 10

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
improvement on so that means up to 10

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.500 
improvement on so that means up to 10
kills<00:03:21.400> per<00:03:21.670> clip<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.150> you're<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.359> hundred

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
kills per clip if you're a hundred

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.330 
kills per clip if you're a hundred
percent<00:03:22.630> accurate<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.350> also<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> other

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
percent accurate and also the other

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
percent accurate and also the other
thing<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.850> does<00:03:25.030> stay<00:03:25.359> actually<00:03:25.720> rather

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
thing is it does stay actually rather

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.960 
thing is it does stay actually rather
accurate<00:03:26.200> in<00:03:26.620> fact<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.130> more<00:03:27.250> accurate<00:03:27.609> than

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
accurate in fact it's more accurate than

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.470 
accurate in fact it's more accurate than
the<00:03:28.030> scar<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.630> think<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:31.030> makes<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.359> an

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
the scar I think which makes it an

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.449 
the scar I think which makes it an
extremely<00:03:31.989> viable<00:03:32.200> option<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.100> tons<00:03:33.340> of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
extremely viable option to get tons of

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.160 
extremely viable option to get tons of
kills<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.269> kind<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.630> cheap<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.049> that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
kills and it's kind of cheap in that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.020 
kills and it's kind of cheap in that
regard<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.220> honestly<00:03:36.519> what<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.700> think<00:03:36.910> should

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
regard so honestly what I think should

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.390 
regard so honestly what I think should
be<00:03:37.150> done<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:39.370> should

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
be done with that is the they should

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.970 
be done with that is the they should
decrease<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.450> size<00:03:40.600> of<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.870> clip<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.590> little

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
decrease the size of that clip a little

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.620 
decrease the size of that clip a little
bit<00:03:42.100> decrease<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.910> power<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.450> I've

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
bit decrease the power of the I've

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.509 
bit decrease the power of the I've
cannon<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.109> little<00:03:44.319> bit<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:45.010> think<00:03:45.220> that'll

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
cannon a little bit and I think that'll

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.059 
cannon a little bit and I think that'll
be<00:03:45.549> that'll<00:03:46.510> be<00:03:46.690> pretty<00:03:47.049> good<00:03:47.260> for<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.650> live

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
be that'll be pretty good for the live

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.830 
be that'll be pretty good for the live
cam<00:03:48.280> it'll<00:03:48.549> fix<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.910> up<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.709> yeah<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.549> then<00:03:52.239> ask

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
cam it'll fix it up so yeah and then ask

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.140 
cam it'll fix it up so yeah and then ask
for<00:03:52.959> other<00:03:53.170> abused<00:03:53.560> guns<00:03:53.829> every<00:03:54.790> now<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.030> then

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
for other abused guns every now and then

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.960 
for other abused guns every now and then
you'll<00:03:55.359> run<00:03:55.569> into<00:03:55.600> someone<00:03:56.139> using<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.970> tpc

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
you'll run into someone using the tpc

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.500 
you'll run into someone using the tpc
launcher<00:03:58.709> which<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.220> semi<00:04:00.970> automatic

alternate fire of it is too late for
mines<00:04:10.810> down<00:04:11.079> but<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.829> only<00:04:11.920> takes<00:04:12.340> three<00:04:12.700> to

as far as the tpc launcher goes my main

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.350 
as far as the tpc launcher goes my main
issue<00:04:20.889> with<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.670> ability<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.180> shoot

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
issue with it is the ability to shoot

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.900 
issue with it is the ability to shoot
all<00:04:22.630> four<00:04:22.900> rounds<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.590> clip<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.550> under

all four rounds in the clip and under

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.870 
all four rounds in the clip and under
like<00:04:25.120> two<00:04:25.660> seconds<00:04:26.200> which<00:04:27.010> honestly<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.639> kind

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
like two seconds which honestly is kind

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.760 
like two seconds which honestly is kind
of<00:04:28.000> cheap<00:04:28.330> considering<00:04:28.780> like<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.139> said<00:04:29.380> three

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
of cheap considering like I said three

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.650 
of cheap considering like I said three
is<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.250> kill<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.510> an

is going to kill and it's it is an
explosive<00:04:32.169> weapon<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.480> you<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.840> deal<00:04:35.110> massive

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
explosive weapon so you can deal massive

trigger<00:04:48.940> was<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.390> bigger<00:04:49.750> issue<00:04:49.990> earlier<00:04:50.650> in

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
trigger was a bigger issue earlier in

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.770 
trigger was a bigger issue earlier in
the<00:04:50.890> game<00:04:50.919> because<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.910> how<00:04:52.120> many<00:04:52.180> people<00:04:52.330> used

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
the game because of how many people used

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.930 
the game because of how many people used
it<00:04:52.990> because<00:04:53.169> of<00:04:53.530> how<00:04:53.800> similar<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.280> was<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.760> like

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
it because of how similar it was to like

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.970 
it because of how similar it was to like
a<00:04:55.090> rocket<00:04:55.450> launcher<00:04:55.840> due<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.590> alternate

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
a rocket launcher due to the alternate

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.230 
a rocket launcher due to the alternate
fire<00:04:57.190> which<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.720> now<00:04:58.870> fire<00:04:59.580> straight<00:05:00.580> exactly

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
fire which and now fire straight exactly

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.740 
fire which and now fire straight exactly
where<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.450> point<00:05:01.890> it<00:05:03.000> does<00:05:04.000> deal<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.480> lot<00:05:04.630> of

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
where you point it does deal a lot of

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.360 
where you point it does deal a lot of
damage<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.470> very<00:05:05.530> effective<00:05:05.950> if<00:05:06.250> you

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
damage and it is very effective if you

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.909 
damage and it is very effective if you
have<00:05:06.660> explosive<00:05:07.660> focus<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.229> explosives

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
have explosive focus and explosives

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.340 
have explosive focus and explosives
improvement<00:05:09.430> on<00:05:09.550> but<00:05:10.300> uh<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.810> does<00:05:10.990> suck<00:05:11.169> up

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
improvement on but uh that does suck up

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.180 
improvement on but uh that does suck up
to<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.919> pretty<00:05:12.820> important<00:05:13.210> parks<00:05:13.510> so<00:05:14.410> uh<00:05:14.440> if

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
to of pretty important parks so uh if

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.260 
to of pretty important parks so uh if
you<00:05:15.340> run<00:05:15.490> out<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.669> trick<00:05:15.820> around<00:05:16.090> while<00:05:16.210> you're

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
you run out of trick around while you're

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.840 
you run out of trick around while you're
pretty<00:05:16.510> much<00:05:16.570> screwed<00:05:17.580> but<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.639> trigger

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
pretty much screwed but the trigger

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.980 
pretty much screwed but the trigger
isn't<00:05:19.150> very<00:05:19.270> much<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.540> an<00:05:19.600> issue<00:05:19.720> nowadays

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
isn't very much of an issue nowadays

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.110 
isn't very much of an issue nowadays
most<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:21.010> its<00:05:21.130> use<00:05:21.310> has<00:05:21.340> been<00:05:21.640> replaced<00:05:21.940> by<00:05:22.000> the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
most of its use has been replaced by the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870 
most of its use has been replaced by the
small<00:05:22.450> which<00:05:23.169> honestly<00:05:23.350> was<00:05:24.160> definitely<00:05:24.790> one

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
small which honestly was definitely one

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.290 
small which honestly was definitely one
of<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.000> most<00:05:25.300> annoying<00:05:25.570> weapons<00:05:26.229> 91<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.300> I

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
of the most annoying weapons 91 and I

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.920 
of the most annoying weapons 91 and I
was<00:05:28.990> kind<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.950> was<00:05:30.280> optimistic<00:05:30.450> when<00:05:31.450> cano<00:05:31.720> 2

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
was kind of I was optimistic when cano 2

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.730 
was kind of I was optimistic when cano 2
came<00:05:32.110> out<00:05:32.520> about<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.880> small<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:35.380> I'm<00:05:35.500> getting

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
came out about the small but I'm getting

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.840 
came out about the small but I'm getting
a<00:05:35.770> little<00:05:35.890> more<00:05:36.039> pessimistic<00:05:36.220> about<00:05:36.610> it

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
a little more pessimistic about it

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.390 
a little more pessimistic about it
because<00:05:37.180> uh<00:05:37.530> kind<00:05:38.530> of<00:05:38.590> combinations<00:05:39.250> have

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
because uh kind of combinations have

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.969 
because uh kind of combinations have
been<00:05:39.550> seeing<00:05:39.760> lately<00:05:40.650> just<00:05:41.650> different<00:05:41.919> people

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
been seeing lately just different people

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.770 
been seeing lately just different people
using<00:05:42.340> like<00:05:42.460> ammo<00:05:42.850> belt<00:05:43.090> in<00:05:43.330> combination<00:05:43.750> with

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
using like ammo belt in combination with

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.510 
using like ammo belt in combination with
explosives<00:05:44.380> focus<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:44.979> explosive

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
explosives focus and explosive

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.360 
explosives focus and explosive
improvement<00:05:46.030> it's<00:05:46.660> a<00:05:47.289> really<00:05:47.620> douchey<00:05:47.860> tactic

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
improvement it's a really douchey tactic

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.920 
improvement it's a really douchey tactic
to<00:05:48.460> get<00:05:48.550> tons<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:48.850> kills

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
to get tons of kills

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.850 
to get tons of kills
along<00:05:50.650> with<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.919> you<00:05:50.979> also<00:05:51.160> have<00:05:52.620> you<00:05:53.620> also

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
along with that you also have you also

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.379 
along with that you also have you also
have<00:05:54.009> those<00:05:54.220> people<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.490> use<00:05:54.669> amo<00:05:55.000> salvage

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
have those people that use amo salvage

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.480 
have those people that use amo salvage
and<00:05:55.780> get<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.960> rocket<00:05:56.350> after<00:05:56.590> every<00:05:56.740> kill<00:05:56.949> it's

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
and get a rocket after every kill it's

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.020 
and get a rocket after every kill it's
also<00:05:57.639> another<00:05:57.820> douchey<00:05:58.150> tactic<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.800> um<00:06:00.030> yeah

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030
