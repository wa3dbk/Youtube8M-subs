00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.130 
complicated cuts to make a Craig joint I
just<00:01:42.550> simply<00:01:42.700> drill<00:01:43.120> holes<00:01:43.390> along<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.990> edge

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
just simply drill holes along the edge

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.750 
just simply drill holes along the edge
where
