00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
process of becoming a ballerina becoming

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.919 
process of becoming a ballerina becoming
a<00:00:49.570> ballerina<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:50.109> a<00:00:50.170> long<00:00:50.440> process<00:00:50.999> I<00:00:51.999> don't

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
a ballerina is a long process I don't

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.989 
a ballerina is a long process I don't
think<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.170> can<00:00:53.320> be<00:00:53.350> fully<00:00:53.949> explained<00:00:54.550> in<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.820> few

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
think it can be fully explained in a few

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.810 
think it can be fully explained in a few
sentences<00:00:55.359> but<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:56.109> takes<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.890> lot<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.370> hard

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
sentences but it takes a lot of hard

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.959 
sentences but it takes a lot of hard
work<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:58.449> lot<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:59.109> training<00:00:59.640> strengthening<00:01:00.640> and

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
work a lot of training strengthening and

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.070 
work a lot of training strengthening and
I<00:01:01.659> think<00:01:01.960> most<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.289> all<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.629> needs<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:04.900> come

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
I think most of all it needs to come

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.660 
I think most of all it needs to come
from<00:01:05.140> your<00:01:05.440> heart<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.830> needs<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.190> be<00:01:06.400> what<00:01:06.550> you
