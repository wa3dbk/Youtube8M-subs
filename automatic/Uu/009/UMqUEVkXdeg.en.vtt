[Heartbeat]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Build of a camara pole for your cell phone in only ten minutes.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Even if you don't have the newest GoPro camera with multiple add-ons you can anyway create cool videos as long as you have a cell phone with video function.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This video tutorial shows you how to create a camera pole for less then €1,- in under ten minutes which will offer you great camera angles.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You only need little MacGyver style materials: scrap wood, rubber band, wood screws
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And some tools: 2 mm wood bit, 4 mm universal bit, rounded rasp, screw driver, drill machine, saw
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Fasten the piece of wood in a bench vise, put the ski pole on to it and make marks left and right of it.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Squeaking]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Turn the wood by 90° and bore 2 mm holes next to the marks. The bit needs not to go through completely.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Drilling]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Turn the wood back into position and fasten it again to saw it into two halfs along side.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Sawing]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Take the half where the holes do not kompletely go through and widen them to 4 mm.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold]

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Drilling]

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Use a rasp to create a mould between the holes. This has to be flatter than half of the skipole diameter.
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Rasping]

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[Music: zAck borer - Love can get ahold, Rasping]

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Fasten the skipole inside the bench vise. I use soft wood like pine to prevent it from damages. Be careful not to squeeze it.
[Music: Blik - Nothing]

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Put the screws into the bigger holes and fasten the wood pieces on the ski pole's sides.
[Music: Blik - Nothing]

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Activate the video mode of your cell phone and fasten it with the rubber band. That's it.
