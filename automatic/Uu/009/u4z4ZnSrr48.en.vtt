00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.989
 Its existence is 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.989
 It is connected in this summer 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.649
 It was a width that continued 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.230
 Joint 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.079
 Have been there 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.650
 Another one 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.649
 I did not understand 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 It looks like there is a very special connection 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 I hear that I need to increase the amount of exercise 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.770
 Maybe 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.480
 I do not know 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.210
 Results ahead 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 Certainly there is a high threshold among them 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.110
 While you can help them 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.320
 Recently 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 There is also ibm çµ†

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.010
 It is to be disadvantaged 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 understood 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.140
 Labor market turmoil 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 High school students are held until the 25th 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 It will be 02 years 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 Wait a second 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.860
 Got on the waves 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.200
 With a man I do not know 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.010
 I protected you 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.840
 I asked 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.870
 After that 200 books will not disappear 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.800
 And this is 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 I can not pass 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.980
 I closed a lot of eyes 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.820
 Seems to be here now 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.980
 What will happen from now on 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 I had experience to convey a message 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.660
 Originally 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 Not present in this data 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.040
 I heard about it and opened up my record 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.850
 With the message 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.960
 What I felt during the trip 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.450
 Fabric 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.760
 Three Thais on the same day 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.099
 Great decrease 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.789
 By doing so 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 Healed by another umbrella 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.839
 For everyone who leads to that 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.059
 Or 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 I have something I want to tell about the site I visited 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.809
 Yokoo Kaname 35 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.809
 Thus the curtain closed 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.159
 I wanted to use it immediately 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.119
 It is thought that I was sick this time 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.119
 And 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 A piece of memory that leads to the house 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.599
 The truth over the parade 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.849
 Many companies can use it 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
 It was in your hearts 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.059
 There is nothing that will lead to steady 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.859
 There is also a cost 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.859
 I can not miss these sadness 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.069
 Maybe 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.819
 I've also had mold up to now 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.149
 It starts from now 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.269
 It was 49th place 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 I'm going to go 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.620
 Cinema Today Movie News 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.389
 Make a new decision 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.469
 I'm going this time
