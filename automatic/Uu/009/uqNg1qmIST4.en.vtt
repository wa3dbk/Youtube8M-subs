twenty seven and a half inches long and
obvious<00:01:13.520> obviously<00:01:14.520> being<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.540> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
obvious obviously being the one this is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.890 
obvious obviously being the one this is
gonna<00:01:15.780> offer<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> most<00:01:16.680> amount<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> power<00:01:17.900> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
gonna offer the most amount of power you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
gonna offer the most amount of power you
can<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.130> FX<00:01:20.610> technology

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
can see that it has the FX technology

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
can see that it has the FX technology
here<00:01:21.689> which<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.320> improve<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.860> torsional

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
here which will improve the torsional

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.359 
here which will improve the torsional
stability<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.390> also<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.590> has<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
stability it also actually has the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
stability it also actually has the
comfort<00:01:26.790> hybrid<00:01:27.450> grip<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.049> creating<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.650> very

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
comfort hybrid grip so creating a very

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.929 
comfort hybrid grip so creating a very
very<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.460> feel<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.990> GT<00:01:31.409> Gromit<00:01:31.890> system<00:01:32.310> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
very good feel and a GT Gromit system so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
very good feel and a GT Gromit system so
it'll<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> biggest<00:01:33.810> sweet<00:01:34.020> spot<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it'll have the biggest sweet spot and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.359 
it'll have the biggest sweet spot and
give<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> ton<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> power<00:01:36.979> next<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
line we have the Sierras o2 and this one

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
line we have the Sierras o2 and this one
is<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.420> unique<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.979> proud<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> say

that we finally brought back the
legendary<00:01:47.009> sledgehammer<00:01:47.759> technology<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
legendary sledgehammer technology and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.740 
legendary sledgehammer technology and
the<00:01:49.350> idea<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.119> head<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the idea is as you can see the head of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
the idea is as you can see the head of
the<00:01:51.960> racket<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.950> string<00:01:53.220> bed<00:01:53.369> gets

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the racket actually the string bed gets

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.480 
the racket actually the string bed gets
wider<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.720> most<00:01:55.140> tennis<00:01:55.680> players<00:01:55.950> hit

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
wider because most tennis players hit

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
wider because most tennis players hit
most<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.420> their<00:01:57.540> shots<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> upper<00:01:58.590> part<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
most of their shots in the upper part of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
most of their shots in the upper part of
the<00:01:59.009> racket<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.360> allow<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the racket and this will allow you to
