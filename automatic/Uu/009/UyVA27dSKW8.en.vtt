again and then go home you know so it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
again and then go home you know so it
was<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> change<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.510> how

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
was a it was kind of a change in how

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.930 
was a it was kind of a change in how
people<00:00:42.690> were<00:00:43.110> working<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.730> go

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
people were working out so I would go

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170 
people were working out so I would go

every day with a bag full of shoes being

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
every day with a bag full of shoes being
in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> shoe<00:00:48.570> business<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.170> knew<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
in the shoe business I knew that you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500 
in the shoe business I knew that you
know<00:00:49.800> wasn't<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> good<00:00:50.250> idea<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.789> running

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
know wasn't a good idea to go running

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
know wasn't a good idea to go running
for<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> long<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> pair<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> basketball

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
for a long time and a pair of basketball

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
for a long time and a pair of basketball
shoes<00:00:53.520> wasn't<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.360> good<00:00:54.570> idea<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.140> try<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> play

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
shoes wasn't a good idea to try and play

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
shoes wasn't a good idea to try and play
basketball<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> pair<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> running<00:00:56.969> shoes

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
basketball and a pair of running shoes

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.750 
basketball and a pair of running shoes
so<00:00:58.320> i<00:00:58.350> would<00:00:58.649> actually<00:00:58.739> always<00:00:59.219> carry<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> bunch

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so i would actually always carry a bunch

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
so i would actually always carry a bunch
of<00:00:59.879> shoes<00:01:00.090> around<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.570> me<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
of shoes around with me when I go to the
club<00:01:01.559> cause<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.829> didn't<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.129> exactly<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
might be doing and I was wanted to be

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
might be doing and I was wanted to be
ready<00:01:04.830> switch<00:01:05.400> shoes<00:01:05.610> most<00:01:06.570> people<00:01:06.990> however

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
ready switch shoes most people however

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
ready switch shoes most people however
weren't<00:01:07.619> doing<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.220> were<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
weren't doing that they were going to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.219 
weren't doing that they were going to
the<00:01:08.939> club<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.080> with

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the club and they would go there with

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
the club and they would go there with
you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.100> shoe<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> try<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> do

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you know with one shoe and try to do

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.200 
you know with one shoe and try to do
everything<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.860> most<00:01:14.010> cases<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:15.030> one

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
everything and in most cases that one

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.899 
everything and in most cases that one
shoe<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.650> appropriate<00:01:17.310> became

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
shoe was not one not appropriate became

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
shoe was not one not appropriate became
very<00:01:17.939> clear<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> me<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> world

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
very clear to me that at what this world

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.850 
very clear to me that at what this world
needed<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> shoe<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.650> performed<00:01:22.650> well

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
needed was a shoe that performed well

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
needed was a shoe that performed well
enough<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:24.750> multiple<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:26.390> activities

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.170 

primarily<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.770> big<00:01:33.160> problem<00:01:33.610> was<00:01:33.760> how<00:01:34.000> do<00:01:34.060> you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
primarily the big problem was how do you

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.600 
primarily the big problem was how do you
design<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.540> shoe<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.110> stable<00:01:35.650> enough<00:01:35.890> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
design a shoe that is stable enough and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.260 
design a shoe that is stable enough and
and<00:01:37.060> has<00:01:37.510> enough<00:01:37.840> traction<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.650> durability

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and has enough traction and durability

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.600 
and has enough traction and durability
for<00:01:40.270> basketball<00:01:40.960> or<00:01:41.230> tennis<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
for basketball or tennis and on the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.510 
for basketball or tennis and on the
other<00:01:42.730> hand<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.240> actually<00:01:43.720> still<00:01:44.680> gives<00:01:45.400> you

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
other hand is actually still gives you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.130 
other hand is actually still gives you
enough<00:01:45.730> he'll<00:01:46.000> lift<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.510> cushioning<00:01:46.990> and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
enough he'll lift and cushioning and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.050 
enough he'll lift and cushioning and
it's<00:01:47.740> lightweight<00:01:47.980> enough<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.640> actually<00:01:48.760> go

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
it's lightweight enough to actually go

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.540 
it's lightweight enough to actually go
running<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.660> brought<00:01:50.290> this<00:01:50.560> problem<00:01:51.070> back<00:01:51.280> to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
running I brought this problem back to

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.800 
running I brought this problem back to
Nike<00:01:51.940> because<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.690> saw<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.350> situation<00:01:54.130> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Nike because I saw the situation and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.020 
Nike because I saw the situation and
