00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.900
 with you channel helpful tips and 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.179
 devices for giving and home and my 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.839
 the most such 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.240
 1 subscriber Barry Stankin twice already 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.300
 asked me filmed inspection pit here 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.120
 somehow I could not do it in principle 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 there is nothing like this pit 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.710
 supernaturally super smart usually pit 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 these pits and I have 2 at the dacha garages 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.489
 his talk is the same and try something 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.749
 invent a new drawing thought out even 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.749
 I thought that in a hole 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.559
 if for the line here was specifically 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.989
 would such 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:49.870
 a row of stairs from here and go down into the pit 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.620
 but thought let it remain so 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.319
 simple 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.629
 if it was a repair shop 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.760
 cars up you can think about 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.100
 cool Anna and so for your 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 car is enough for the head 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 the construction is very simple simple 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.939
 dug hole 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.140
 lined with brick then here's a corner 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:18.520
 in piled on it lay pine 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.979
 boards are not shields but one by one why 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.950
 that we need a small space 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.070
 dare there 3 4 boards i know people do 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.229
 shields but hard to carry and think so 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.109
 dostochku one delayed 2 delayed and all 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.700
 ok you have enough mean 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:40.000
 the width of this pit 80 centimeters is she 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.640
 I saw a corner here so a cad corner 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 81 cm 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 volume when boards remove boards walls easily 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.930
 easily jammed 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.140
 so look well, then this little bit 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 turned 100 km from and inside it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 the inside but 67 centimeters of this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.200
 comfortable enough to feel there 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 work afterwards 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.670
 pit length 280 why is it 80 could 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.320
 do like the length and but here's how 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 time the basement boundary goes even a crack 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.780
 went such a brick supply too lay out 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:34.020
 look here for padvana 2 climb 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.780
 type why is this link and we are with 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:45.000
 head if let's say I shot here 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:48.180
 I bring the gearbox here like 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.360
 time I get rear axle then 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.400
 eat instead eat and take off wheels and semi 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.290
 Vasya pull out and dismantle the gimbal and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 gearbox and it was all articles 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.910
 left the car on the goats in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.340
 lake repair came again lot 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.160
 silencer is valid if I silencer 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.959
 or climb under someone I stop by 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.790
 usually back and how you can ride 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.950
 car a little bit backward this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.940
 that's already quite a size as to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.330
 he is universal and normal do not need 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.269
 dig a lot put it away 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.940
 but I say if a personal pit is made 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.000
 for car repair on this 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.060
 earn that 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.880
 the pit is preferably long 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.900
 and then there is such a ladder from 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.340
 welded stationary see enough 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 I grabbed a bar here because there 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:53.769
 that uvolok 63 costs and then the board 40 here for 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.989
 bill of this bar 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:01.290
 Mind becomes but it is flush 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.480
 then there's sawdust there 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.120
 because when you change the oil all but 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.150
 something yes spilled yes and old mats 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.900
 automobile lie only shed immediately 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.019
 sawdust glasses 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.359
 collected all threw away all the affairs of rubber 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:21.370
 keep old is useful on pajero 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.830
 maybe when so here as always 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.169
 know it dug like a plushkin and all on 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.690
 keep it because you are not sure 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.380
 tomorrow 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:36.700
 Well, so it works, everything is simple and 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.820
 effectively need to completely removed all the boards 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:47.160
 and walk yourself Automobile repair 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.410
 so here's a checkup 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.140
 pits yes another depth pits yes 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.140
 each must make for their growth here 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.419
 need to do as i count i think 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.000
 do a little bit deeper even better then 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.500
 can some kind of shield be put or something 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.570
 still such but if you do in the butt 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.039
 someone tall will climb him 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.550
 uncomfortable working in this me 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.039
 but such pits are doing purely for themselves 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.200
 right here I have a sixty meter depth 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:25.870
 and that's not enough with my meter 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.100
 seventy seven growth need something 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.389
 put it so comfortable everything is fine 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:38.740
 pine board she's just 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:42.070
 painted yes the problem of all the pits i 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.670
 I think the ventilation here is a blowjob 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.530
 the vent 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.870
 need to do both basement ventilation and 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.420
 supply and exhaust vy leakage 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.520
 or how to say 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.490
 mean why the circulation was there 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.160
 Vlogov considered especially here in the winter summer 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.860
 I still so but I'm just how are you 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.190
 here here at this distance about such 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.230
 small and so here a little bit 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.090
 leaving such a gap special to 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.490
 excess moisture came out yes it's not that 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.250
 effect but hotshot instead 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.410
 ventilation but in general if you are someone 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.600
 plan yourself a scheme for finding 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.540
 ventilation is imperative i.e. under 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:27.610
 riding should be pulling moisture 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.470
 at the very bottom it will be inlet 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.050
 ventilation here so both the basement and 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.690
 diagonal vest is desirable so in this 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:42.880
 the corner means the inlet corner will be 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:44.380
 Well, so about running my pit I 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.740
 pleased with such a pit 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.800
 that is, working with the car is one 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.990
 pleasure you know if you want 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.530
 crawled under the car the problem is driven 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.770
 people even on the street jacking on 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:04.240
 there Podlazov that it is inconvenient and 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:08.760
 so simple and angry well from you both 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.490
 always husky questions 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.050
 write comments and comments questions 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.050
 under the piggy bank questions and 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.440
 comments thanks everyone for attention up 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.440
 new meetings
