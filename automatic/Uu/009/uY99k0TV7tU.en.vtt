so we start at six months and in the
beginning<00:01:05.210> everything<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.229> pureed

bit of milk I the breast milk or formula

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100 
bit of milk I the breast milk or formula
and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.460> start<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.090> fruit<00:01:15.900> and

vegetables<00:01:16.770> pureed<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.420> can't<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
vegetables pureed and you can't of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
vegetables pureed and you can't of
experiment<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.799> different<00:01:20.240> flavors<00:01:21.240> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
experiment with different flavors for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.179 
experiment with different flavors for
example<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.080> kids<00:01:22.320> loved<00:01:22.560> banana<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
example I my kids loved banana and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.670 
example I my kids loved banana and
avocado<00:01:23.689> mixed<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.810> together<00:01:24.990> which<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.560> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
avocado mixed up together which was very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
avocado mixed up together which was very
easy<00:01:25.979> she<00:01:26.310> doesn't<00:01:26.490> need<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.820> any<00:01:26.970> cooking

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
easy she doesn't need to do any cooking

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.620 
easy she doesn't need to do any cooking
and<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.290> assume<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:28.979> won't<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
and don't assume that they won't like it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
and don't assume that they won't like it
when<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.810> start<00:01:31.290> weaning<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.700> beginning

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
when you start weaning in the beginning

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
when you start weaning in the beginning
the<00:01:33.390> solid<00:01:33.780> food<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.950> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the solid food that they take in it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
the solid food that they take in it's
not<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.119> calorie<00:01:36.479> content

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
not actually about the calorie content

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.749 
not actually about the calorie content
they're<00:01:37.409> still<00:01:37.680> getting<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.369> their

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
they're still getting all their

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.990 
they're still getting all their
nutritional<00:01:39.570> needs<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:41.009> from<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.729> milk

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
nutritional needs really from the milk

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
nutritional needs really from the milk
either<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.780> breast<00:01:43.020> milk<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.740> formula

either from breast milk or from formula

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.819 
either from breast milk or from formula
it's<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:45.060> learning<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.689> taste<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.619> they

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's about learning to taste and they

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
it's about learning to taste and they
taken<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:47.790> little<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:49.020> couple<00:01:49.259> of

taken very very little just a couple of
spoons<00:01:49.770> even<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> mean<00:01:51.030> Rufus<00:01:51.420> presumably

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
spoons even so I mean Rufus presumably

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
spoons even so I mean Rufus presumably
has<00:01:52.170> three<00:01:52.530> meals<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.009> day<00:01:53.040> does<00:01:53.579> he<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.000> have

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
has three meals a day does he we have

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
three and a half days suffer as well so

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and he has he pretty gets free between

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.620 
and he has he pretty gets free between
500<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.800> 600<00:02:01.160> miles<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.670> milk<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.970> day<00:02:02.000> as<00:02:02.360> well

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
500 to 600 miles of milk a day as well

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.750 
500 to 600 miles of milk a day as well
and<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.500> start<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.190> once<00:02:04.460> they<00:02:04.700> do

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
and you do have to start to once they do

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.000 
and you do have to start to once they do
start<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.600> bigger<00:02:06.080> meals<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.680> have<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
start to have bigger meals you have to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710 
start to have bigger meals you have to
start<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.430> cut<00:02:07.610> down<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.149> milk<00:02:08.360> because<00:02:08.600> it

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
start to cut down the milk because it

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.359 
start to cut down the milk because it
takes<00:02:08.930> up<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.229> lot<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.410> space<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:09.860> little

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
takes up a lot of space in little

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.820 
takes up a lot of space in little
tummies<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.630> actually<00:02:11.810> have<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.530> give

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
tummies so you do actually have to give

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.620 
tummies so you do actually have to give
them<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.220> option<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> solids<00:02:14.270> first

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
them the option of the solids first

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.630 
them the option of the solids first
because<00:02:15.260> if<00:02:15.380> they<00:02:15.530> were<00:02:15.680> thrown<00:02:16.040> sort<00:02:16.520> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
because if they were thrown sort of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.870 
because if they were thrown sort of
satisfied<00:02:17.240> they<00:02:17.450> wouldn't<00:02:17.720> be<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.020> interested

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
satisfied they wouldn't be so interested

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.340 
satisfied they wouldn't be so interested

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
I've got have a big got the NHS leaflet

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.780 
I've got have a big got the NHS leaflet
which<00:02:26.480> was<00:02:26.630> really<00:02:26.840> helpful<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.560> kind<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.280> led

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
which was really helpful and kind of led

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.199 
which was really helpful and kind of led
through<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.840> know<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.170> start<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.970> age

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
through you know how to start what age

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.820 
through you know how to start what age
to<00:02:32.600> give<00:02:32.750> them<00:02:32.930> certain<00:02:33.110> things<00:02:33.530> yeah<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.740> think

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to give them certain things yeah I think

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.470 
to give them certain things yeah I think
it's<00:02:34.130> important<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> get<00:02:34.820> hold<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.300> those

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's important to get hold of those

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.410 
it's important to get hold of those
guidelines<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.470> say<00:02:36.770> from<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.370> NHS<00:02:37.940> so

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
guidelines as you say from the NHS so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.660 
guidelines as you say from the NHS so
for<00:02:38.690> example<00:02:38.780> think<00:02:39.620> babies<00:02:40.070> under<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.490> age

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
for example think babies under the age

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.780 
for example think babies under the age
of<00:02:40.850> one<00:02:41.090> shouldn't<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.750> having<00:02:42.100> salt<00:02:43.100> or<00:02:43.490> honey

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
of one shouldn't be having salt or honey

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.130 
of one shouldn't be having salt or honey
you<00:02:44.150> have<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.450> careful<00:02:44.660> about<00:02:44.930> those

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you have to be careful about those

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.470 
you have to be careful about those
things<00:02:45.470> they<00:02:45.709> have<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.100> be<00:02:46.280> older<00:02:46.730> than<00:02:47.060> six

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
things they have to be older than six

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.810 
things they have to be older than six
months<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.260> eggs<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.340> as<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.580> say

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
months to have eggs and as you say

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.360 
months to have eggs and as you say
protein<00:02:50.420> that's<00:02:50.630> normally<00:02:51.260> later<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.890> beyond

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
protein that's normally later on beyond

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.000 
protein that's normally later on beyond
nine<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.910> ten<00:02:53.150> months<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.870> well<00:02:54.110> as<00:02:54.530> changing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
nine and ten months as well as changing

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.070 
nine and ten months as well as changing
the<00:02:55.100> consistency<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.060> actually<00:02:56.540> what

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
the consistency it's actually what

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.680 
the consistency it's actually what
they're<00:02:57.350> eating<00:02:57.670> Joe<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.390> children

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
now obviously they're a little bit older

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.640 
now obviously they're a little bit older
do<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.269> find<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:02.959> all<00:03:03.110> like<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.620> same

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.160 
to make big batches of things and then
you<00:03:24.440> could<00:03:24.709> free<00:03:25.610> small<00:03:26.180> portions<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.989> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.650 
you could free small portions of the
food<00:03:27.440> just<00:03:28.070> an<00:03:28.250> ice<00:03:28.370> cube<00:03:28.670> trays<00:03:29.060> you're

doing every single time then it's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.370
