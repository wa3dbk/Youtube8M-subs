by itself I there's only like two games
to<00:05:22.530> probably<00:05:22.950> do<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.370> they're<00:05:23.940> just<00:05:23.970> those

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.120 
to probably do that they're just those
two<00:05:25.010> that's<00:05:26.010> quite<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.490> quite<00:05:26.970> something<00:05:28.130> they

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
two that's quite a quite something they

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.230 
two that's quite a quite something they
ever<00:05:29.990> designed<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.229> piece<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.590> music<00:05:32.240> you
