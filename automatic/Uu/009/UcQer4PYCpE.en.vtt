00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and compute things and question your

and compute things and question your
assumptions<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> other<00:01:44.130> hand

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
assumptions when I on the other hand

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.940 
assumptions when I on the other hand
would<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.110> having<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.380> small<00:01:46.650> brain

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
would just be having a small brain

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.630

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.400 
to me they never forced me to study it's
the<00:04:44.790> same<00:04:44.970> thing<00:04:45.150> with<00:04:45.270> my<00:04:45.389> son<00:04:45.449> I<00:04:45.870> don't<00:04:46.169> ask

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the same thing with my son I don't ask

the same thing with my son I don't ask
him<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:47.010> spend<00:04:47.370> time<00:04:48.030> doing<00:04:48.090> his<00:04:48.660> homework<00:04:48.870> I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
him to spend time doing his homework I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.810 
him to spend time doing his homework I
just<00:04:49.560> tell<00:04:49.710> him<00:04:49.889> that<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.520> do<00:04:50.639> this

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
just tell him that you have to do this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.969 
just tell him that you have to do this
you<00:04:51.600> figure<00:04:51.930> out<00:04:52.080> when<00:04:52.350> you're<00:04:52.470> going<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.860> do

it and so far I think it's it's worked
for<00:04:54.810> us

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.570
