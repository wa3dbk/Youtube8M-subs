gloss like this on a client this is just

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to keep everything clean it also extends

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.880 
to keep everything clean it also extends
the<00:03:09.240> life<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.600> your<00:03:09.750> makeup<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.230> also<00:03:10.470> run

cold season you know we get sick but we

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.300 
cold season you know we get sick but we

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.530

wouldn't<00:03:14.490> recommend<00:03:14.730> using<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.240> lip

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
wouldn't recommend using your lip

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.729 
wouldn't recommend using your lip
glosses<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:16.170> you're<00:03:16.290> sick

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
glosses when you're sick

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.320 
glosses when you're sick
I<00:03:16.770> recommend<00:03:17.430> switching<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.970> lipstick

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
I recommend switching to lipstick

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.930 
I recommend switching to lipstick
because<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.810> easier<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.290> sanitize<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.430> that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
because it's easier to sanitize and that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.030 
because it's easier to sanitize and that
is<00:03:21.090> how<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.300> clean<00:03:21.570> my<00:03:21.900> lip<00:03:22.230> ease<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.800> hope

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
is how I clean my lip ease so I hope

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.440 
is how I clean my lip ease so I hope
that<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.459> helpful<00:03:23.580> for<00:03:23.820> some<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.330> who
