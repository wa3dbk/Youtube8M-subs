the first phablet from a Nokia and what

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.410 
the first phablet from a Nokia and what
makes<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.309> really<00:00:11.400> different<00:00:12.030> well<00:00:12.179> then

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.999 
does a really good job and what I like
about<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> plane

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
about it is if I was going on to a plane

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
about it is if I was going on to a plane
I<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.729> select<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.630> stories<00:01:36.960> as

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I could select some of these stories as

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.450 
I could select some of these stories as
my<00:01:37.680> favorites<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.970> show<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
my favorites and then they would show up

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.600 
my favorites and then they would show up
offline<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.150> pretty<00:01:42.479> cool

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
offline so that's actually pretty cool
