with<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.770> speed<00:04:18.010> option<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.609> flip<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
with the speed option I flip it to the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.680 
with the speed option I flip it to the
other<00:04:19.480> side

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
other side

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
other side
and<00:04:20.870> then<00:04:21.200> run<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.590> from<00:04:21.830> there<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.910> works<00:04:23.150> a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
and then run it from there it works a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.600 
and then run it from there it works a
lot<00:04:23.450> better<00:04:23.750> because<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.230> one-on-one<00:04:24.610> with

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
lot better because it's one-on-one with

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000 
lot better because it's one-on-one with
the<00:04:25.970> free<00:04:26.210> safety<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.620> have<00:04:27.740> an<00:04:27.830> extra

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the free safety and you have an extra

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.700 
the free safety and you have an extra
blocker<00:04:28.310> on<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.700> side<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.260> get<00:04:30.440> I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
blocker on that side it's a you get I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.210 
blocker on that side it's a you get I
typically<00:04:31.310> get<00:04:31.460> very<00:04:31.850> big<00:04:32.090> gains<00:04:32.360> from<00:04:32.600> it

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
typically get very big gains from it
