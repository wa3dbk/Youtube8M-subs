00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.040
 hello girls the max and I mean it 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.139
 Almost everyone today has a smartphone 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.519
 There are people who buy themselves a lot 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.040
 something new gives people who already have 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.259
 I ancient but my fits precisely 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.029
 now that the iphone 6 is new and 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.410
 quite a lot of people because it totally depart 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.689
 there is still the one or the other 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.640
 had another of no smartphone 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.739
 I asked myself this summer 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.849
 I actually endure that 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.259
 without a smartphone 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.700
 I have to say I mean I am 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.800
 someone i'm standing on technology i stand 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.829
 on any gadgets but as me 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 I have now also somehow 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.309
 I believe for three years or so 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.410
 smartphone so not so long 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.600
 actually before that has a normal 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.239
 Handy that was also sufficient but the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.280
 big joke is there since I was 18 or 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.170
 but I do not remember what I did 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.629
 without a smartphone would do it all 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.909
 sitting in the train or somewhere on something 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.469
 wait or something is I always watch too 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.719
 smartphone always on it looks to whether he 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.789
 I've ever watched twitter 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.260
 anything on the internet 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.850
 just read any things 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.500
 something yes or matt the one or 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.660
 look at other things on youtube 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.270
 that's just a great job 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.470
 the thing and now seriously 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.300
 would you do if you do not 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.400
 smartphone more would have my animal 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.200
 needs in smartphone or he said 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.060
 the fuck does not need a human 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.010
 So now I have to completely 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.920
 honestly I do not know what I mean 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.330
 would do without a smartphone but me 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400
 Of course, there are people who can understand 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.350
 The saying does not mean I need and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.420
 what should I do with it and then you will be like that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.340
 slave of the device and something there is yes 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.700
 also people are just out there 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.110
 principle totally against it and then stop 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 as well as the whole but nothing 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.140
 but I did not just have my smartphone 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.750
 how should I say so so 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.190
 entertainment functions so speak 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.840
 when it's boring that you can do it 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.580
 I can finally watch my 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.390
 even a normal phone and 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.300
 I use my cellphone 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.100
 That's what made him mobile in 2014 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.990
 it is accessible almost all of these 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.580
 circle also gives some hardcore 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.900
 denied by no means 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.700
 But they want to do it well 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.470
 that's alright but he has 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.890
 still other quite meaningful things yes 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 be it in the diary, for example 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.519
 any weather stories that one 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.360
 news can look that one 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.860
 can get messages sent 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.300
 with pictures and so it was there 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.290
 things are not pure 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 entertainment moderately thought and it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.680
 brings what I mean if I have 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750
 so often in the morning somehow at the station 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.450
 confessed or so and once because of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.100
 For example, you could look at the news page 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.500
 you still ss a heartbeat to the ss 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.180
 I remember history in the morning 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.380
 stood at the station on golem 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.770
 looked and read somehow ssl 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.209
 back because no idea about the piece scrolls 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.530
 then it was me, although the extent of the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.880
 not quite clear yet but me 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.620
 I knew my least ever 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.300
 bescheid what is before moving on to the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.740
 work has come so it has indeed 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.420
 quite practical purposes so 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.310
 I would really care about that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.130
 you because he would zone so generally 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.550
 first time without a smartphone or 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.980
 but you also think so 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.480
 it makes sense that you have so much with you 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 makes his smartphone and himself 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440
 partly so dependent on the thing makes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060
 because you have to be honest in 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.730
 today's time is really like that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440
 somebody loses his smartphone that is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.160
 then most of the time 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.370
 First, the things are bloody expensive 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.230
 coming 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.090
 there are in all price region which 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.890
 but there are people there are people 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.580
 happy but usually one is 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.350
 smartphone 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.950
 but always for each own 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.390
 relatively larger investment so yes 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.980
 I do not have to go for 1000 right now 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.320
 euro somehow it latest iphone else 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.570
 buy something but that costs already 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.610
 little bit the next one , of course 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.500
 all things that are on it are 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.000
 of course if the thing is lost 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.799
 or if the thing is stolen 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.840
 or anyway, of course, first 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.610
 Let's go and I think that's the case 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.170
 most of the bigger loss 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.180
 and I'm not talking so much about it now 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.720
 intel the music stuff or something like that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.170
 you usually nowhere else but yes 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.900
 for example, contacts photos or 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.610
 any messages or what pass 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.780
 Whatever was so, so many 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.670
 Things will probably be today 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.459
 solely on the smartphone 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.390
 store and you only realize that they are 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.150
 no longer has if the smartphone 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.370
 really gone is good this problem 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 is partially since then the whole 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.789
 There are cloud services and a lot of people 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.680
 their smartphones are also sinking 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.849
 maybe not so acute anymore 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.510
 There are still things that are up 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.760
 the smartphone if the change is that 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.470
 nice shit the next one is me 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.690
 my on the smartphone are also 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.950
 a lot of private stuff yes I want 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.840
 Do not know who with his smartphone 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.910
 already naked pictures of the girlfriend or 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.010
 something has done yes they are there too 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.660
 on it and you really want that 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.600
 if someone stole the smartphone yourself 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.600
 the fca can gain access to that 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.920
 that someone sees yes I have on mine 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.380
 smartphone also determines the one or 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.850
 other things on it where I think there 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.370
 not so keen if someone cares 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.650
 Of course it always has to be done 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.480
 Of course you also think about it 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.490
 it's always a bit like that 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.930
 double-edged history with the whole 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.730
 thing but as I said you write the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.190
 Comments do you think you would 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.540
 real earnest endure without smartphone 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.300
 so i can avoid sharing about it 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.580
 she can say seriously i had 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.720
 fits relatively late one actually you 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.250
 Not me at all I mean I have everyone 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.330
 people of every amount of technology fucking 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.070
 lots of gadgets and whatever else 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.230
 I was 1 late and I have 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.400
 I always used to say that 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.290
 ' ve got a cellphone what needs a 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.270
 smartphone but now as I have since 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.740
 as off and shit people i could be mine 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.250
 no longer imagine that without 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.530
 smartphone users so often be it for 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.900
 live streams look up in the evening in bed 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.850
 the loo I need something to look 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.890
 I want I want to do a lot of loose 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.410
 partly to listen to music for something 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.690
 look at so many things so I 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550
 the permanent case I will be relative 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.640
 rarely actually called or even 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.980
 so I use the whole of this whole 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.560
 internet multimedia whatever history 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.730
 which holds such a smartphone and offers 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.740
 Honestly I would know in some 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.560
 situations make me what i should do 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.060
 to be bored without a smartphone except me 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.980
 I would wait or wait almost anywhere 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.420
 Somewhere laws around there that's real 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.810
 but a cool thing and no idea 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.790
 why I why that's why I insist 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.170
 he should not renounce her 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.300
 you can say you write the comments 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.590
 if that would get to the series here 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.960
 or maybe you are even someone 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.970
 that generally rejects and says smartphone 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.320
 You do not need such a fucking with me 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.610
 believe that is the least here but 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.420
 if you can be someone like that in 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.970
 to write the comments 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.050
 he 'll also be interested in why 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.460
 one I can's can fully 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.360
 understand but maybe then gives 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.010
 sensible reasoning 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.110
 as I said write your comment 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.110
 make up for the next matches
