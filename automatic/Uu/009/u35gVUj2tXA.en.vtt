00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
everything was really fried like for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
everything was really fried like for
some<00:01:22.860> reason<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.190> thought<00:01:23.340> I'd<00:01:23.940> been<00:01:24.119> here

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
some reason I thought I'd been here

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.510 
some reason I thought I'd been here
before<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.720> thought<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.950> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
before and I thought that the like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.660 
before and I thought that the like
cafeteria<00:01:27.270> area<00:01:28.050> would<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.399> better<00:01:29.399> food

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
cafeteria area would have better food

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.280 
cafeteria area would have better food
but<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.149> pretty<00:01:30.300> much<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.630> burgers<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but it was pretty much like burgers and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.010 
but it was pretty much like burgers and
chips<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.890> chocolate<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.759> crisps<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.720> that's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
chips or chocolate and crisps so that's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.580 
chips or chocolate and crisps so that's
what<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.200> went<00:01:34.350> for

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what we went for

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
what we went for
and<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.820> feeling<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.119> hungry

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and I've got a feeling we're hungry

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I've got a feeling we're hungry
later<00:01:38.240> yeah<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.570> feel<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.020> sick<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.860> it
