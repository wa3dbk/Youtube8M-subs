00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:17.510
 Yes, hello, bj r4. Yes. 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:24.410
 I told you the best way to keep this hole. 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:27.169
 This time, that can be discarded discarded the No. 5 hole protect all resources 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.880
 I want to tell you one batch method. 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.240
 You're talking about most of those crucifixes you talk about . 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.960
 I wrote it. 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:43.300
 Well, first of all, 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.420
 It will put the outer bubble that reaches the center, or it will give the sheep a mortar. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.290
 Now based on Park Po 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.980
 An example of a god of death 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.980
 Hold 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 You have to erase one space on the bottom so that the player is right. 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:08.230
 This is one space to give this film is so attached to food 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.070
 Now , try to buy a little more. 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:16.380
 I can not make this setting. 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 This next barrier 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 Installed 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 Can you please pull all the way to fourth day 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 Ah 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 Ah 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.610
 This is the first time I've released it, so I need to raise the hole quickly . 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 Because you can install it that much 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 Let's put a barrier on this side too. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.510
 4 This is the soldiers stood up just yet, then change one foil 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:12.230
 Jigetjyo a lot because safety is the top range carried in almost all ranges 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:17.660
 So let's do this here, like this . 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 As I have told you before, 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.010
 Safer 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.160
 Because you can defend 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.630
 The more intersections you have, the better. 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.930
 Well to be the second set then Horan yeogida Toya 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.360
 When Moyenov comes in like this 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:44.340
 Sometimes I catch dapgo somewhere in the middle even cannon Archer emitter've just seemed so 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.300
 This can be enough . So let's get this bomb in front of me and install two like this. 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.970
 That would make it a little more secure. 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.010
 So now when the hole is only dispose of so eat up resources that can be protective film 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.970
 Maybe this setting is broken 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.360
 The defense also now doeneundeyo haejwoya as a defense 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.500
 So now 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.290
 This way, 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.330
 This way, 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.710
 Hana Han and 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.590
 You can make settings so that you can push them in. 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.420
 Now work 4 stone rocks 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.050
 I could think of it. 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.050
 4 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.900
 We have a crab set aside because we become a subtitle . 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.900
 U 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 Let's do it dry and install like that. 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.530
 So, yes. 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.590
 Last year, I also blocked my house. 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.590
 4 4 4 Ah lead 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.590
 4 5 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.810
 4 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:06.330
 Please set it in the center of the Park Falls 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:11.670
 You can get to the hall. 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.290
 Find the coming Restaurants Restaurants yiraneunge so resources just to satisfy the resource visibility 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 People say it's a restaurant. 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.540
 The ball book is literally confusing . 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.220
 It is 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:28.470
 I can not get to the point because I can not be 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.120
 Cherish this also true because what resources they can keep all so 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.520
 I think it's a good idea. 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:39.570
 But it is a little too early to go to April when 3 comes 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.470
 The setting is something that I first noticed , 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.990
 Because there is no 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:49.950
 Music viewers who are also doing the Crash of Clan again 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.940
 How do you think it would be best to have a good idea 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.380
 It would be best if you run it once after you have made your own judgment. 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.580
 I would like to 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.880
 If you are watching in Africa for 4 seconds, I would like to plant trees by recommendation . 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.740

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.949
 Thank you. 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.020
 Not 5 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.620
 It's enough to keep 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.650
 4 If you install it, it looks nice and clean. 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.720
 He throws away the hole, but Dimension 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:24.670
 You can just film pluralistic Defense and brings out all the time that Mick 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.670
 It's going to be set . 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.930
