00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 let's say so i'm very much captains of the game 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 advice but let's say you can't see it 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.150
 so the last very many day I 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.240
 spent at the computer I played the bag and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 I was called to the team for what I am task 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 agreed to play and play some 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.190
 time counting would be delayed and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 heredity and starladder and teams 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.390
 and changing roles, everything has become very 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 interesting pulls glow 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 I said playing a lot 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.720
 respectively in different games 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 accordingly, I immediately see the sides and 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.950
 no problem for me to analyze the game 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.630
 and I see what happens after each 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 teamfight i can say i could 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.920
 do better and what could have done 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.810
 not as good as they can do 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.329
 accordingly well it is easily managed 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.609
 i am doing this the game is not exactly for 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.170
 People therefore this all the same game therefore 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.570
 play or all really want with people 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.519
 than for some position therefore if 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 I was called to some other police 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.899
 i come there because it is enough 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.210
 easy it is given yes definitely to play 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.399
 team and the process of the game is in 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 the team is much quieter than the role itself 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.659
 I can tell all the mistakes of all the players then 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.159
 there is a start to captivate them but I am 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.840
 practically and do it because there 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.310
 will be too toxic the team is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.530
 what is the danga here and there 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.110
 Kirov we have as a player is a man 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
 which plays either 010 or ten zero 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.530
 and accordingly, if we play 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.880
 because the team is training 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.950
 plans have seen many women because we 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.690
 We play every time with midlaner which 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.080
 score 010 she fnaf kir play well 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.040
 I promote come and quickly winning 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.260
 our shooter down he 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.600
 especially as never he shoots 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.790
 either does not shoot so many 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.320
 games have to believe even without him 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
 and support will not on whether they will always 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.010
 stand as you like and where is my 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 train a few champions 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.450
 months so we are ready pokemon final 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.210
 He will say exactly before the flop in Turkey 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.369
 everything was as planned to put it mildly 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 we jumped light enough teams but 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.100
 In general, I did not see anything special from 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.870
 words showed me what I am transitional 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.709
 my roles 0 can sink from the fact that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.480
 I miss something and surely we 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.690
 A lot of experience with this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.489
 niro map and understand their mistakes then that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.770
 something we did not finish playing bills 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.260
 I hope that every team except two 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.630
 also all something especially if we go 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.880
 on this frame we will win the standard 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.810
 I think that the chances will be exactly the same but 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.330
 and got smaller because 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.470
 still will not come much stronger which 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.680
 trains more 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 and I think that if the gas she took a little 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.459
 slower than brazil too 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 so I think that there is a chance to win 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.170
 but they are a little smaller than even before
