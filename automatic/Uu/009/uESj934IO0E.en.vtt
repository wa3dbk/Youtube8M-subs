00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.390
 so here we are going to do the same thing 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.949
 but back and I'm doing the 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.329
 knots will allow it to become clearer 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.219
 as in this put in particular the 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.270
 design is in the front and 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:27.360
 break it so that in the back 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:30.660
 a picture appears that you do not want me 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.660
 like to put me 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.230
 and all over the pants by the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.030
 tomorrow I'm here shorts and a bar 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.030
 I ask if I do not cut 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.590
 ok then here we continue with the same 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.110
 I was not doing a way in 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 particularly the great ones remember that 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.050
 more or less a little finger a little finger and a half 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.020
 of thickness in wheat to its best of here 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.619
 well just like this without making it more formal 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.770
 It will be entertaining if it's that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.860
 but the second part comes good now 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 we know we do not remember and stretch 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.759
 we throw a little bit like they say 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.810
 we had and for me personally I 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.060
 can carry well also has had yes and 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.590
 there we are going to do but if we wanted 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.270
 then adjust it a little back 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.479
 what we have to do is that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 I'm going to catch here 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.610
 what we are going to do the same 30 of your 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.690
 eyes and basic 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.690
 the basic one that has this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 It's okay like that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.580
 and this causes the shirt to have the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.580
 I form as I have lost 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.820
 this what was not to be done 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:39.080
 the breakfast is already good because the end 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.410
 of week three days Saturday around here or 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.410
 over there 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.409
 if the next model is waiting 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.950
 so I cut the important thing in half 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:59.459
 to the horizontal and then each to the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 vertical 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.819
 to the vertical yes good we cut the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 pocitos I'm going to make you unpublished 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.790
 memories of the other side I have and if 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.230
 is escaping for the pass of is from 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.230
 lie is coming will do 20 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.360
 so the shirt that was very big 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.110
 Because of this, it is not so much 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.780
 OK 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.780
 wants to fix a final 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:57.260
 the last the last one forward the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.260
 final is that I cut the long here 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.360
 and things 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.360
 without knowing I would have this strict 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:20.090
 carefully 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:23.240
 very entertaining of a comedieta shirt 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.480
 it can be a very good image appears 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.480
 a shirt under transparent
