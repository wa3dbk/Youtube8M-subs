truly<00:05:40.530> natural<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:41.130> people<00:05:41.490> can<00:05:41.639> get<00:05:41.759> an<00:05:41.880> idea

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
truly natural so people can get an idea

truly natural so people can get an idea
of<00:05:42.240> what<00:05:42.599> is<00:05:43.380> achievable<00:05:43.639> natural

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
of what is achievable natural

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.019 
of what is achievable natural
so<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.569> question<00:05:46.719> was<00:05:47.279> out<00:05:48.279> of<00:05:48.339> the<00:05:48.580> YouTube

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.360 

first<00:07:08.870> thing<00:07:09.080> if<00:07:09.200> it's<00:07:09.380> a<00:07:09.470> genetic<00:07:09.860> thing<00:07:10.040> I

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
first thing if it's a genetic thing I

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.160 
first thing if it's a genetic thing I
would<00:07:10.520> recommend<00:07:11.030> going<00:07:11.240> to<00:07:11.510> a<00:07:11.660> doctor<00:07:12.139> and

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
would recommend going to a doctor and

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.320 
would recommend going to a doctor and
finding<00:07:12.680> out<00:07:12.740> what<00:07:13.130> the<00:07:13.310> underlying<00:07:13.610> causes

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
finding out what the underlying causes

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.680 
finding out what the underlying causes
of<00:07:14.360> why<00:07:15.020> he's<00:07:15.800> feeling<00:07:16.220> the<00:07:16.310> pain<00:07:16.550> if<00:07:17.419> his

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
of why he's feeling the pain if his

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.330 
of why he's feeling the pain if his
forms<00:07:18.110> on<00:07:18.290> and<00:07:18.440> he's<00:07:18.530> feeling<00:07:18.560> pain<00:07:19.070> then

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
forms on and he's feeling pain then

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.540 
forms on and he's feeling pain then
there<00:07:19.910> is<00:07:20.720> obviously<00:07:20.900> something

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
there is obviously something

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.850 
there is obviously something
biomechanically<00:07:22.550> wrong<00:07:22.760> although<00:07:23.590> the<00:07:24.590> form

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
biomechanically wrong although the form

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.730 
biomechanically wrong although the form
might<00:07:25.070> not<00:07:25.280> be<00:07:25.460> on<00:07:25.610> it<00:07:25.910> might<00:07:26.090> look<00:07:26.360> good<00:07:26.440> but<00:07:27.440> I

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
might not be on it might look good but I

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.470 
might not be on it might look good but I
would<00:07:28.250> definitely<00:07:28.490> recommend<00:07:28.730> putting<00:07:29.270> it

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.480 
would definitely recommend putting it

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.760 
would definitely recommend putting it
out<00:07:29.600> there<00:07:29.630> on<00:07:29.810> the<00:07:30.050> internet<00:07:30.410> for<00:07:30.560> other
