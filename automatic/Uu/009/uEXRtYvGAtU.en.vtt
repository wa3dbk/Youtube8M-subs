touch fiddly to get your fingers in
because<00:00:36.899> there's<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.590> gap<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
because there's not much of a gap so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.150 
because there's not much of a gap so
what<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> normally<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> screwdriver

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
what I normally do is use a screwdriver

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.910 
what I normally do is use a screwdriver
to<00:00:42.379> flick<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> catch<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.120> pull<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> plug<00:00:45.600> off

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
to flick the catch and pull the plug off

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
to flick the catch and pull the plug off
so<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:46.950> I've<00:00:47.280> done<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.420> I'll<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when that's in the hole I've used a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
when that's in the hole I've used a
screwdriver<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:52.440> push<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> catch<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
screwdriver to push the catch that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
screwdriver to push the catch that
simple<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> try<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.469> your

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
simple but if you try and get your

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
simple but if you try and get your
fingers<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.100> isn't<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.760> room<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
fingers in there isn't much room it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
fingers in there isn't much room it's
quite<00:00:57.390> tight<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.079> very<00:00:58.199> easy<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.800> fit<00:00:59.210> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
quite tight so it's very easy to fit but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
quite tight so it's very easy to fit but
haven't<00:01:00.629> got<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.870> room<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.469> fingers

tool<00:01:21.170> now<00:01:22.170> we'll<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.159> two

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
tool now we'll make up these two

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.760 
tool now we'll make up these two
connectors<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.600> important<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> small

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
connectors very important that the small

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.090 
connectors very important that the small
sloped<00:01:28.939> latch<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.570> goes<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> catch

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.499 

listen<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> click<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> can't<00:01:36.270> pull

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
listen for the click and you can't pull

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
listen for the click and you can't pull
it<00:01:36.540> apart<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:37.110> possible<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:38.070> fit<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it apart as possible to fit these the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
it apart as possible to fit these the
wrong<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:38.970> around<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> must<00:01:40.290> make<00:01:40.680> sure

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
wrong way around so you must make sure

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.340 
wrong way around so you must make sure
that<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.579> slope<00:01:41.850> peg<00:01:42.210> goes<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that the little slope peg goes to the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
that the little slope peg goes to the
latch<00:01:43.560> clicks<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> can't<00:01:45.420> pull

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
latch clicks all and then you can't pull

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.880 
latch clicks all and then you can't pull
it<00:01:45.720> apart<00:01:46.430> that's<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.959 

then<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.009> just<00:01:51.159> need<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.399> find<00:01:51.549> somewhere

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
then you just need to find somewhere

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.520 
then you just need to find somewhere
suitable<00:01:52.450> amount<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.960> you've<00:01:53.200> got<00:01:53.350> plenty

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
suitable amount it you've got plenty

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.289 
suitable amount it you've got plenty
options<00:01:54.039> on<00:01:54.219> here<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.640> could<00:01:54.789> use<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.969> cable

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
options on here you could use a cable

cleaned<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.570> off<00:02:05.039> with<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.070> little<00:02:06.280> bit<00:02:06.460> of

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
cleaned that off with a little bit of

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.550 
cleaned that off with a little bit of
solvent<00:02:07.030> cleaner<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:08.019> we're<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.349> use<00:02:08.530> a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
solvent cleaner and we're going to use a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.030 
solvent cleaner and we're going to use a
Velcro<00:02:09.069> attachment<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:11.319> supplied<00:02:11.709> with<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
Velcro attachment it's supplied with the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.180 
Velcro attachment it's supplied with the
module<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.319> I'm<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:14.890> open<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
module so I'm going to do is open a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.020 
module so I'm going to do is open a
moment<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.610> here<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:18.370> pretty<00:02:18.580> much<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
moment on here it's pretty much up to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.430 
moment on here it's pretty much up to
you<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.390> you're<00:02:19.540> mounted<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.319> as

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
you where you're mounted but just as

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.170 
you where you're mounted but just as
long<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> edge<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.489> itself

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
long as it's not on the edge of itself

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.430 
long as it's not on the edge of itself
because<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.630> will<00:02:22.720> be<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.140> bit<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.349> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
because it will be a little bit of a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.059 
because it will be a little bit of a
harsh<00:02:23.980> vibration<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.150> very<00:02:25.330> excessive

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
harsh vibration and a very excessive

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.039 
harsh vibration and a very excessive
heat<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:29.230> I'll<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.739> now<00:02:30.810> pop<00:02:31.810> some

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
heat so all I'll have to do now pop some

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.539 
heat so all I'll have to do now pop some
cable<00:02:32.380> ties<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:35.069> time<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.160> have<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> wire

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
cable ties on time you have the wire

00:02:36.549 --> 00:03:21.420 
cable ties on time you have the wire
harness

brake horsepower you have low medium and
high<00:03:58.180> we're<00:03:59.180> also<00:03:59.359> going<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.720> start<00:03:59.840> off<00:04:00.109> in

high we're also going to start off in

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.960 
high we're also going to start off in
the<00:04:00.319> medium<00:04:00.650> set<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:01.069> always<00:04:01.310> recommend<00:04:01.819> this

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
the medium set you always recommend this

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.520 
the medium set you always recommend this
because<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.480> gives<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.870> best<00:04:03.049> balance

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
because this gives the best balance

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.670 
because this gives the best balance
between<00:04:04.190> power<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.150> fuel<00:04:05.599> economy<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.530> that's

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
between power and fuel economy so that's

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.949 
between power and fuel economy so that's
it<00:04:06.889> job<00:04:07.190> done<00:04:07.459> all<00:04:07.639> we'll<00:04:08.060> have<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.299> do<00:04:08.419> now<00:04:08.629> is

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
it job done all we'll have to do now is

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.960 
it job done all we'll have to do now is
start<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.530> engine<00:04:09.919> go<00:04:10.190> for<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.430> drive<00:04:10.699> and

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
start the engine go for a drive and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.989 
start the engine go for a drive and
