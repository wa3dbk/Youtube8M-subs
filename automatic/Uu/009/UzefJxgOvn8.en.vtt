00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
battery units and stuff I mean some of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.340 
battery units and stuff I mean some of
them<00:00:41.550> over<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.720> corroded<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.199> you

up<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.839> charge<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.129> I've<00:00:47.250> sacrifices

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
up a charge again so I've sacrifices

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.500 
up a charge again so I've sacrifices
battery<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:50.100> benefit<00:00:50.519> me<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.390> other

applications the application is I have a
quite<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.329> expensive<00:00:55.550> streamlight

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
quite an expensive streamlight

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.069 
quite an expensive streamlight
flashlight<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.270> you've<00:00:57.420> ever<00:00:57.539> went<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> buy

flashlight if you've ever went to buy
one<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> battery<00:00:58.800> packs<00:00:59.070> they're

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
one of the battery packs they're

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.330 
one of the battery packs they're
relatively<00:01:00.270> extremely<00:01:00.840> expensive<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> i

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
relatively extremely expensive and i

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240 
relatively extremely expensive and i
found<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.770> well

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
found they don't really work that well

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.050 
found they don't really work that well
or<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.240> didn't<00:01:06.479> work<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.660> well<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:08.060> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
or it didn't work that well for me so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.290 
or it didn't work that well for me so
what<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.300> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.820> show<00:01:11.910> you<00:01:12.149> a

picking up any goals at all so I cut

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.289 
picking up any goals at all so I cut
these<00:01:38.790> down<00:01:38.869> out<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> battery<00:01:40.500> pack<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
these down out of the battery pack and

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.330 
these down out of the battery pack and
three<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.509> make<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.710> same<00:01:43.920> size<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
three of these make up the same size of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.940 
three of these make up the same size of
the<00:01:44.430> night<00:01:44.670> camp<00:01:44.909> batteries<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.390> here

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the night camp batteries right here

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
the night camp batteries right here
coincidence<00:01:47.000> well<00:01:48.000> I'll<00:01:48.450> tell<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> what

we're going to do we're going to come
out<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> be

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
out over here and I'm going to be

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.160 
out over here and I'm going to be
pushing<00:01:53.159> almost<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.119> three<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.869> still<00:01:55.140> needs

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
pushing almost at three it still needs

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.190 
pushing almost at three it still needs
to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> charged<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.810> probably<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> do

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to be charged and probably going to do

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.709 
to be charged and probably going to do
is<00:01:58.610> load<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:02.390> put<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.570> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
is load this up in here and put these in

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.670 
is load this up in here and put these in
series<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.570> should<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:07.020> able<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
series and I should be able to have a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.410 
series and I should be able to have a
little<00:02:08.070> light<00:02:08.429> coming<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.269> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
little light coming out that's just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420 
little light coming out that's just
because<00:02:09.660> they're<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> weak<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.709> there

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
because they're kind of weak and there

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.340 
because they're kind of weak and there
it<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.269> know<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.690> I've<00:02:12.810> got<00:02:13.079> a<00:02:13.110> good

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it is so now I know that I've got a good

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.210 
it is so now I know that I've got a good
functional<00:02:13.980> set<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.760> batteries<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.959> i<00:02:16.500> will

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
functional set of batteries and i will

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.080 
functional set of batteries and i will
also<00:02:17.489> wrap<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:20.130> plastic<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.760> shrink

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
also wrap these and plastic and shrink

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.840 
also wrap these and plastic and shrink
wrap<00:02:21.299> thing<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.810> my<00:02:22.530> heat<00:02:22.980> gun<00:02:23.010> once<00:02:23.549> i<00:02:23.670> get

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
wrap thing with my heat gun once i get

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.530
