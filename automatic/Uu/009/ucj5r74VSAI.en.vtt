00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.799
 this episode is an offering 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.799
 galapagos games and magazines from around the world 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.639
 it was not this was a cyclist 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.850
 you may find that these customers are 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.330
 a mythological battle game 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 armies and such 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.359
 nor does he have peace indicates daily control 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 many too strong even because you see 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 It's too tight you see the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 serve cycle for three players 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 two he is small with five expands one 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.960
 little but still very tight you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 has to expand but it is a game of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.000
 control area just does not have both 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 This will strengthen the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 correct 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 I did not go back so much the opportunity to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.680
 be invaded but everything really happens 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.090
 in the administration of money and you will 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430
 do that yes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 controlling the areas but mainly 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 saving with spending at the right time 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 It's time to come to this board here. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.000
 and choose the gods correctly to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.700
 order you to do socialization 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 to evolve will influence her a lot 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.470
 repeating oneself in a warlike selection is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.540
 that goes your age one will get one 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 civilization that will build 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 own buildings and try to protect themselves 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.930
 always when placing ships in the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 the correct position to prevent 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 enemy troops come ships are 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 great for you to really protect 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 your daughters if you do not leave anyone 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.210
 approach is you'll be safe 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.040
 to build on that island is more 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.770
 quickly but it is a game of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 administration of money and nobody knows 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.170
 When the money you have then you have 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 to be on the bluff 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 you can suddenly force the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.060
 opponent to spend money 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 even though you do not want it god 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 now but you have the possibility 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 of him then wanting to get away but 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.790
 less did not leave cheap to take 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 that favor of the decisive agency for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.979
 he can steal something from 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.770
 someone and especially the shift order 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.110
 It is very important that you 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.729
 that whoever was the first to play will have 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 opportunity to buy the best 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 creature if you have logical money you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.250
 try if you have given the money 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.790
 very well on the other shifts and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.409
 creatures are of themselves 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.959
 in the game from the moment you 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.060
 knows the creatures you know 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.000
 each peace and choreography very 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.250
 easy for this the game gets really fast 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.439
 and dynamic is the game that I present very 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.680
 here for new players because you can 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.670
 five people and works very well with 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.140
 Write a review 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.700
 he is thus in first turn a 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.950
 little slower because everybody 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.390
 trying to know what it is not if god does 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.090
 that's cool 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 runoff is already everybody bag 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.209
 betting they keep the money on the hour 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.780
 often learning even more 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.959
 having fun is a very interesting game 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.329
 it is mainly at the time of betting 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.389
 people stay there you got me out of there 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:59.109
 and now that I'm going to make sure that I adapt 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.790
 your turn-by-turn strategy and this 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.319
 leaves the game very very dynamic one 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.669
 game I've had here for several years 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 since when the version was released 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:09.099
 original still galatians 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.840
 but he never left my top is I 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.230
 I swear not knee and certainly never 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.269
 come on he was a designer that one of the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
 designers who shorter bruno catar 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.739
 squid and people often me 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.659
 ask how I want to compare because 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.889
 is being released simultaneously there 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.389
 It was not but here in Brazil the 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.319
 bottle simultaneously with 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.510
 hot and not a game at all 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.489
 replaces the other is folks bought it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.040
 bought another guy against the two 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.959
 okay if you can with both because they 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.209
 not at all 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.780
 replaces what is and what is not 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.729
 evolution is the 2.0 cycle is in another 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.260
 completely different mechanic is a 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.790
 different universe has only the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.069
 really a bit of control of 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.590
 area and manages the way the issue of 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.129
 creatures too but he can even 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.470
 complement your gaming group but he 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.209
 does not replace in any way I did 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.819
 Here, the only game is yours. 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.340
 know as a base game by itself is already 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.840
 very cool but it's coming out here 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.989
 in brazil also by galatto is the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.030
 expanding and bringing new 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.060
 skills new ways you post 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.130
 here on this trail of the gods and now 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.359
 released in the United States to titans who 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.099
 creates teams and such 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.719
 in the opportunity we will bring the 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.060
 two here to show you how it is that 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.200
 It works in cycles as I told 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.480
 you are a 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.330
 I play for timeless he has a 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.330
 Fantastic immersion within the theme of late 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.880
 Olympus gods and creatures 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.220
 mythological you really feel the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.160
 creatures are so powerful takeshi 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.530
 Stand alone, come on, who does what? 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.100
 I find myself doing apocalyptically and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.010
 although this is very thematic and does 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.300
 with which you really feel 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.360
 graced by that creature at the moment 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.370
 right I think this is fantastic if you already 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.780
 have some interaction in this type of 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.020
 universe literature 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.530
 you will see that he is extremely 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.480
 thematic 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.220
 I love to play. I hope you have. 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.110
 tanned as much as I hope 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.040
 becomes a popular game in Brazil 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.080
 without him as I spoke this our galaxy 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.730
 have any translating here because he 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.670
 was produced in Poland in the same place 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.080
 the factory is where it was produced here 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.970
 that my French version 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.640
 it arrives with the same quality 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.040
 Wait, it's worth it, I 'm art. 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.470
 viewer if you enjoyed our video 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.750

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.240

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.870
 Okay, thank you so much, see you soon 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.870

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.130

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.600

 although the game and kagame search in haiti 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.130
 a few or my next
