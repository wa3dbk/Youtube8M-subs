00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.639
 let's write any kind of the message is we select one of our 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.280

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.939
 it uses push notifications 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.879
 so it becomes 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.759
 for a program in the courier program almost to say 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.759

 we're not going to have to go to the notification menu and from there 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.840
 we see that once the application is installed in that area 1 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.610
 we will look there then we just have to enter here 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.310
