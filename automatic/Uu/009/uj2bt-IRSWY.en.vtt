00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.400
 the sanction cameras of the 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.740
 semaphores no longer fine the mayor joseph 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.679
 López thus fulfills one of the promises 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.960
 of his electoral program says that in the 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.660
 last months the town hall has arrived 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.240
 raise in fines close 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.210
 of 6 million euros 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.580
 the order was given that the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.629
 radar cameras a few days ago I think that 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.400
 until Sunday they could not turn off 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.540
 because they needed to be paid by the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
 own maintenance technicians that 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.629
 takes a company of murcia protection 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.890
 let's wait until the end of the month 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.720
 because we are talking about the company I said 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 no no no longer expect more strip 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.280
 cable and it disconnects we have said that 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.809
 there is no charge that no fines will be chosen 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.760
 fines are passed if we continue 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.290
 photographing we have the obligation to 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 pass the fines and we have 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.440
 prevaricating then what we have done 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.909
 at the moment it's turning it off let's see 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.530
 to study the legislation to see if it 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.850
 can have simply as cameras 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.350
 traffic control how do you have other 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.640
 cameras the entrance of the sleeve the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.260
 of the entrances to the personal area of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 Cartagena well let's study them from 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.170
 that way to see if you can use 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.369
 for that and after they are notarized 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.600
 of any accident to be able 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.250
 put it in any accident since 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.270
 are already there is the expense done but what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 that we do not want is to enter the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.689
 Cartagena with more than 5.8 million 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.159
 euros I think it was the last one that today 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.560
 raised with the cameras from a 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.330
 erased and the mayor josé lópez leaves in 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.670
 suspended the sale of land of 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.810
 windmill until the tastings are done 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.030
 relevant archaeological 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
 the city hall paralyzes the sale of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.770
 land of the hill does it taking in 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.840
 tells the latest publication of the doctor 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.970
 Iván negueruela in which he assures that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 those floors hide what one day 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.799
 was the palace of Asdrubal says 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.479
 they are going to dig the plots coming to 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.549
 agreements with companies and funds 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.340
 investment and that once you know what 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.740
 that there will be acted consequently gross 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.240
 Roman baths that what forums 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.890
 Roman theaters and camps and theater there 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 within the Mediterranean arch but a 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.450
 palace of a Carthaginian prince there is no 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.940
 none and well, we have 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
 allowing it to be destroyed we have gotten 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.569
 the excavators in different stages 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.039
 we have broken what was still there 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.720
 vestiges still says the black doctor 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.190
 which is worth keeping because 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 so much I do not want to sell 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.819
 parcels the city council of cartagena 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.290
 he is in need of money and more 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.640
 now that we do not have to continue the foot 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.170
 was suppressing the fine of the cameras 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 for example and that we intend 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.150
 as we promised to download the ibi down 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.920
 we are decompensating the budget 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.510
 but what I can not do is play in 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.459
 the future of Cartagena to sell three 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.540
 plots that I can not guarantee me 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.459
 my momentary economic success 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 killing the future of Cartagena and the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.969
 future of Cartagena is very much in the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.340
 tourism in archaeological tourism that 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.859
 it's seasonal and it brings money during 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.049
 12 months a year the bird will arrive by 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.120
 the current train station the mayor 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.829
 josé lópez keeps the commitment that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.359
 signed before a notary before the 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.220
 elections together with the party 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.439
 socialist that if they came to the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.299
 government the bird would arrive by the current 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.159
 station and not by mandarache as 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.889
 the previous government of the 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.299
 popular party what need has 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.859
 Cartagena right now to take the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 station to another site other than the 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.239
 commitment of this mayor and the rest of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.099
 the opposition of the socialist party 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.659
 also that the station stays where 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.129
 víctor beltrí therefore as we 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.079
 they said it 's a nobody's time that was 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.049
 the mayor of 111 of the 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.519
 station to the both the mayor with the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.439
 deputy mayor the government team 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.549
 wants the station to stay where 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.590
 say the Cartagena that is in the 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.480
 center 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.000
 asked about the possibility that the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.160
 development ministry say no to this 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.349
 location of the arrival of the bird to 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.060
 cartagena your station this is what 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.000
 said the mayor jose lopez 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.800
 it would be a revenge of the ministry 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.300
 because if it's 800 meters, I've been there since 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.459
 the mandarache to the station 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.319
 beatriz I do not see I do not see what is the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.910
 difference would be simply once a 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.310
 Revenge of ministry ministry 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.750
 of the moment now what will happen in 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.080
 November the national elections do not 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.080
 we know
