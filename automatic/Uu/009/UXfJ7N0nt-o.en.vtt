 association ok 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 the history of cryptozoology we 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.309
 account the discovery of more than 180 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.009
 species of strange mammals with 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.230
 nasal appendages that existed in a 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.550
 Pacific Ocean archipelago a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.920
 true hidden world discovered in 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 1941 this is the story never told 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 of the happy kingdoms my name is a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 failure are welcome to reality 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.940
 paranormal prepare to meet a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.940
 story that you will never forget we started 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.430
 rino degrees 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.820
 History tells us that everything began 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.549
 in 1941 when a prisoner of war 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 named queen of perversion escaped the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.180
 Japanese army 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 in your life to swim the ocean currents 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 they took us to a mysterious and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.170
 unknown archipelago in the ocean 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.170
 peaceful 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.840
 ainara and discover a zoo oasis 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.720
 where the animal species had a 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.290
 evolution different from the one known in the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.290
 five continents 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.040
 the mammals of that land had 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.130
 developed nasal appendices of a 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.250
 unimaginable way that allowed them 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.659
 adapt to the environment of the island very 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.560
 unlike any other animal 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.860
 known in the world beings similar to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.300
 small rodents flying with their ears 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.020
 walking with appendages that come out of their 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.610
 nose very similar to octopus or squid 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.730
 others with a long limb that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.620
 a set of beings worked in support 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.700
 incredible living in the archipelago 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 baptized as ja ji ji ho hi hi island 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.650
 but despite the discovery of hainan and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 his incredible story there was no study 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.860
 of the biodiversity of the island up 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.840
 1957 when the German naturalist at 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.540
 Allston who studied these strange 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.330
 creatures making their great monograph 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.640
 entitled under a living of ruined 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.100
 big 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.100
 shape and life of the rhinos degrees 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
 according to the studies of the stock teacher and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.270
 the rhinos degrees conformed in an order 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.460
 independent biological 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.890
 characterized by its peculiar morphology 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.690
 and its methods of movement which 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.420
 was that instead of using their 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.150
 legs used their long and extended nose 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.700
 to move the degrees degrees 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 they divided into two families the monkey queen 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 of a single nose and the police of several 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.840
 nose 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.739
 this that described 26 genres and 189 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.200
 species within the order of the kingdoms 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.780
 degrees where the appendices of their 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.389
 noses will be useful to them as much as 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.349
 walk as if to catch hold of 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:50.299
 hold capture insects and so on 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.299
 discovery was incredible 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
 but before we knew more about this 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.489
 amazing find a nuclear test 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.170
 made near the archipelago 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.290
 ended with the existence of these beings 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.629
 and even with harrison own that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.000
 who sunk along with the islands and the 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.329
 implausible history of the kingdoms 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.329
 degrees 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 nowadays we know about these animals 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.930
 cryptids for the work he left us on 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.150
 his studies in the book we found 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.370
 detailed schematics of its anatomy and 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.440
 bone composition in addition to these 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.440
 features and functions with their 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.539
 developed appendices the varied 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220
 forms and species enriches the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.180
 monograph of the creatures more 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.160
 unusual never seen a lost world 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.050
 that does not fit the understanding of 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.050
 life forms on our planet 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.320
 but all this unusual story is just 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.500
 a work created by the imagination of 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.440
 German zoologist gerard steiner of the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.330
 university to preserve its monograph the 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.720
 did with such detail that it was 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.960
 interpreted as a true story 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.440
 his characters in the person and teachers 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.410
 tonky as well as the archipelago hi hagi and 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.560
 the 189 species of big river ever 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.870
 they existed steiner created a parody 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.150
 scientific with all his wit and 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490
 zoo knowledge to do those 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.550
 technical drawings descriptions and 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.320
 systematization is perhaps this truth we 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.230
 explain why there is no 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.250
 photography or filming of celebrities 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.250
 pri no degrees 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.250
 still today many people 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.220
 they talk about this story as a fact 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.560
 real accusing of a conspiracy to 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.139
 try to hide the truth of these 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.449
 critics the legacy of this episode 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.150
 zoo crypto found in the 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.820
 zoological museum of this hamburg where 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.979
 we can appreciate the representations of 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.979
 those strange trills degrees 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.460
 a fabulous story that even though 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.800
 it was not real we are excited to think that 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.840
 there are still unknown creatures that 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.820
 we can discover in future emissions 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.950
 we will talk about animals 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.900
 discovered in recent years and 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.270
 we will continue in search of the animals 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.190

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.520
 it seems that the truth already extends 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:39.620
 a lot of quackery the media
