 will have a whole torrent or like it or 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.989
 there was also another one that was 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.800
 was another other torrent team 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.800
 but I have 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.260
 and I 'm just going to explain it 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.640
 start downloading in your program that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.060
 have you this program so that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.700
 can start to download good start 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.710
 to download what the fire 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.390
 for example I have it here just 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.730
 downloading is here, what came to the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.500
 half 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.630
 will depend a lot on the speeds of 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.930
 internet maybe and also from the 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.940
 people who have what the game 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.680
 already complete for example is already just 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.340
 is there then this one already has it 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.150
 full 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.210
 the temperatures 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.189
 [Music] 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.840
 and almost everything it offers is 360 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.060
 days that he was elected, they will have ready 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.289
 to download it possible that I by 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.079
 example how this art is she who has 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.829
 for instructions are very simple 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.710
 when for her to have to download her 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.219
 game what will happen is that afterwards with 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.219
 a called folder that you may need 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.539
 my production and it will let you 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.539
 files while they have 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.380
 good good edit this little program to 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.720
 world and the bei montull is optional damon 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.350
 seek to use it in using them can do it 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.350
 Web 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.310
 Well, they 're going to do this because there are 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.620
 instructions in the m 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.450
 says extract 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.300
 copy 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.209
 own on a disk or mount the file 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.730
 point did this you can not ride it with 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.660
 he on youtube can extract the file 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.890
 point did with the wild grass too 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.940
 and once what is level two 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.670
 mounted recorded or extracted from the game 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 the panito milestone file told the seen 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.600
 that if it's chosen, it looks a lot like 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:42.690
 this one to see what football is 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.340
 the center and other plated games 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.150
 but because it has worked 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530
 I imagine that exactly the same 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.630
 let's get to this they will install the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.160
 that they are going to ask for permits 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.170
 administrator les mills and they give him 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.060
 next five following last the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.560
 two and if you want to start the game 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.630
 well then what thousands of options and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.430
 they will give you to finalize why because 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.830
 be in each game of course not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.630
 you can leave it like that I want to say that the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.580
 originals of the company grades by 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.350
 lots of denouncements errors and so on 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.430
 intellectually not want to see the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.430
 game 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.650
 Well, the people are going to do this to us 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:23.019
 the cracker fire like 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.709
 in more colors with the secret you will call 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.829
 codex can be from this this dll that 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.409
 sting to ping to the launcher until the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.530
 point that the game has 23 we have 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.090
 some or some copy it all 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.269
 they go to the folder he was hungry 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.269
 installed 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.709
 the right the direct access 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.099
 and they really give you open and folders of 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.099
 destination 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.879
 already done only cope in the archives 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.379
 of dana and there they say I suppose normally 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.030
 and ready 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.049
 we appear 360 already know that they have to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.170
 record them and it seems that ax 2 points 5 x 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.390
 4 I do not remember very well and to play 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.010
 3 I think it is necessary to record it if 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.530
 they have a chip and two are recorded in 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.310
 the memory of play 3 or on a hard drive 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.570
 externally as you could 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.090
 these methods of choice I do not have very 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.700
 related to telling them more or less like that 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.010
 exactly how to do that to have to 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.560
 look for you in another good part les them 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.820
 I say the links 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.990
 and until next time I hope it serves them 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.990
 and subscribe
