00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.090 
with Sam but you can sort of mold it see
how<00:01:35.899> I<00:01:35.929> can<00:01:36.050> mold<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.320> my<00:01:36.440> hands<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:36.920> holds

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
how I can mold in my hands and it holds

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.340 
how I can mold in my hands and it holds
its<00:01:37.220> shape<00:01:37.280> that's<00:01:37.820> what<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.210> for<00:01:38.509> now<00:01:39.320> I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
its shape that's what going for now I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.200 
its shape that's what going for now I
couldn't<00:01:39.800> find<00:01:39.950> my<00:01:40.159> sliced<00:01:40.429> gin<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.880> had<00:01:41.119> to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
couldn't find my sliced gin so I had to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.600 
couldn't find my sliced gin so I had to
use<00:01:41.390> home70<00:01:42.140> cake<00:01:42.380> tin<00:01:42.649> don't<00:01:43.190> ask<00:01:43.310> me<00:01:43.490> where

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
use home70 cake tin don't ask me where

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.740 
use home70 cake tin don't ask me where
the<00:01:43.759> solutions<00:01:44.240> gone

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
the solutions gone

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.330 
the solutions gone
but<00:01:44.869> we've<00:01:45.259> got<00:01:45.409> Lake<00:01:45.590> from<00:01:45.710> disappeared

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
but we've got Lake from disappeared

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.700 
but we've got Lake from disappeared
essentially<00:01:47.060> Pat<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.659> all<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:48.140> until<00:01:48.530> it's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
essentially Pat this all out until it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.710 
essentially Pat this all out until it's
nice<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:48.950> flat<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.670> go<00:01:50.119> all<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.450> way<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.569> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
nice and flat and go all the way to the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.330 
nice and flat and go all the way to the
edges<00:01:50.899> you<00:01:51.229> want<00:01:51.319> this<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.649> be<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:51.950> flat<00:01:52.159> as<00:01:52.280> you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
edges you want this to be as flat as you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.160 
edges you want this to be as flat as you
can<00:01:52.550> get<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.880> don't<00:01:53.509> be<00:01:53.569> afraid<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.899> use<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
can get it don't be afraid to use the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.570 
can get it don't be afraid to use the
bottom<00:01:54.349> of<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.530> glass<00:01:54.709> to<00:01:55.039> make<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.310> nice<00:01:55.429> and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
bottom of a glass to make that nice and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.400 
bottom of a glass to make that nice and
flat<00:01:55.759> pop<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.599> the<00:01:56.660> oven<00:01:56.690> for<00:01:56.959> 20<00:01:57.140> minutes

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
flat pop that in the oven for 20 minutes

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.800 
flat pop that in the oven for 20 minutes
then<00:01:58.160> we're<00:01:58.550> gonna<00:01:58.700> cut<00:01:58.910> up<00:01:59.090> our<00:01:59.239> marshmallows

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
then we're gonna cut up our marshmallows

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.380 
then we're gonna cut up our marshmallows
while<00:01:59.989> it's<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.319> oven<00:02:01.000> now<00:02:02.000> I'm<00:02:02.209> using

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
while it's in the oven now I'm using

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.479 
while it's in the oven now I'm using
those<00:02:02.539> big-ass<00:02:02.869> American<00:02:03.380> marshmallows<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
those big-ass American marshmallows so I

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.219 
those big-ass American marshmallows so I
cut<00:02:04.879> them<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.090> half<00:02:05.330> but<00:02:05.750> remove<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
cut them in half but remove the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.240 
cut them in half but remove the
marshmallows<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:06.709> we<00:02:06.890> get<00:02:07.009> here<00:02:07.190> in

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
marshmallows that we get here in

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.350 
marshmallows that we get here in
Australia<00:02:07.580> they're<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.789> little<00:02:07.970> bit<00:02:08.060> smaller

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
Australia they're a little bit smaller

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.920 
Australia they're a little bit smaller
so<00:02:10.450> marshmallowy<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.629> way<00:02:11.720> you'd<00:02:11.900> like

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
so marshmallowy the way you'd like

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
so marshmallowy the way you'd like

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
essentially once it comes out it should

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.250 
essentially once it comes out it should
be<00:02:13.970> nice<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.330> golden<00:02:14.540> brown<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.900> hard<00:02:15.020> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
be nice and golden brown and hard and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.600 
be nice and golden brown and hard and
make<00:02:15.410> sure<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.739> test<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.160> everywhere

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
make sure that you test it everywhere

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.550 
make sure that you test it everywhere
including<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.180> middle<00:02:17.420> then<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.290> want<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.500> add

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
including the middle then we want to add

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.119 
including the middle then we want to add

once<00:02:36.950> you've<00:02:37.069> got<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.280> cut<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.519> all<00:02:37.640> over<00:02:37.879> then

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
once you've got to cut it all over then

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.290 
once you've got to cut it all over then
pop<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.920> marshmallows<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.400> essentially

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
pop in your marshmallows so essentially

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.449 
pop in your marshmallows so essentially
lay<00:02:41.540> these<00:02:41.780> marshmallows<00:02:42.140> now<00:02:42.739> leave<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
lay these marshmallows now leave a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.979 
lay these marshmallows now leave a
little<00:02:43.819> bit<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.000> space<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.450> between<00:02:44.480> because

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
little bit of space in between because

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.420 
little bit of space in between because
we're<00:02:45.290> gonna<00:02:45.440> pop<00:02:45.680> these<00:02:45.860> back<00:02:46.099> in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.310> oven

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
we're gonna pop these back in the oven

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.210 
we're gonna pop these back in the oven
allow<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.420> marshmallows<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.410> expand<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
allow the marshmallows to expand and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.119 
allow the marshmallows to expand and
melt<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.480> they<00:02:50.690> will<00:02:50.989> fill<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.680> those<00:02:51.860> gaps

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
melt so they will fill up those gaps

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.650 
melt so they will fill up those gaps
don't<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.700> too<00:02:52.879> worried<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.330> you've<00:02:53.450> got<00:02:53.629> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
bit too you know the jam showing it's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.740 
bit too you know the jam showing it's
all<00:02:56.659> cool<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.590> cool<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:58.549> take<00:02:58.760> and

pop it back in the oven it took me about
10<00:03:02.280> minutes<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.730> melt<00:03:02.970> these<00:03:03.120> down<00:03:03.180> till<00:03:03.660> they

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
10 minutes to melt these down till they

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.740 
10 minutes to melt these down till they
all<00:03:03.750> became<00:03:04.310> gooeyness<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.580> did<00:03:05.820> allow<00:03:06.540> this

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
all became gooeyness like did allow this
