00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and what happens we are here they throw me 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.509
 believe and we will bring the rim the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.460
 fifth strongest a secret agent is 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 here we have the version out there 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.769
 old and you see that right now this sexy 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.960
 as it was before but it also has 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.480
 many changes in the gun 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 now they are golden and they are simpler I think 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.840
 what's better 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.720
 the color is a bit questionable if you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.970
 like it or not but if it's true that before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.330
 I tried to have too many details 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.309
 pistolitas and now I think that is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.910
 better in terms of the character's appearance 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 can it really is very good 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.560
 and it is worth 965 river points we are going to 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.120
 watch 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.120
 the comments against the one 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.810
 control 2 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 control 3 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.610
 and control 4 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.270
 let's see the skills but here 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.630
 we have the passive 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.960
 the self- tankers that do not vary 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.570
 and I'll wait for more minion to come 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.570
 to see here in the queue tail queue 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.630
 The effect of the w 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.630
 the cars that do not change anything more than 975 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.110
 and we will see the last you another by 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.110
 please come 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.509
 it does not change to you 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 well mate that we have some 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 and neither death 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.680
 the rev even when it changes into a cowboy 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.119
 a Patagonian cowboy 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.340
 fuck male the cowboy either 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 the topic is fine 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 in terms of design I know it's good 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.000
 well but the rest 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.940
 Nor they have animation print but 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.560
 it's so super funny how it goes like this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 that nothing good as well as tell me what 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.420
 this one seems to you to whom I think it was 975 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.950
 Rio Point Capital I keep saying that a 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.240
 despite being a bit simple I think that 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.040
 they are better because the others were 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.319
 too complicated in the version 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 old so nothing comments compare me 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.530
 to us live favorites you know that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 it helps a lot anything
