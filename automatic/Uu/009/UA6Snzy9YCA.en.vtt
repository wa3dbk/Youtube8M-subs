but don't get too excited because there

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
but don't get too excited because there
are<00:00:34.380> no<00:00:34.559> actual<00:00:34.800> exosuits<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> game<00:00:36.239> here

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
are no actual exosuits in the game here

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
are no actual exosuits in the game here
we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> first<00:00:37.140> look<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.710> combat<00:00:38.160> night

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340

we have a first look at the combat night
as<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.910> tell<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> first<00:00:40.260> time

ever we can now shoot and Traverse

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
ever we can now shoot and Traverse
underwater<00:00:43.200> which<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.829> personally<00:00:44.100> thought

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
underwater which I personally thought

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
underwater which I personally thought
looked<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.149> cool<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:46.140> away<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.440> going

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
looked really cool right away I'm going

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.170 
looked really cool right away I'm going
to<00:00:46.620> get<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:46.980> saying<00:00:47.219> rename<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> game<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to get people saying rename the game to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.490 
to get people saying rename the game to
deep-sea<00:00:48.600> shooter<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.050> something<00:00:49.410> along

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
deep-sea shooter or something along

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
deep-sea shooter or something along
those<00:00:49.739> lines<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.460> keep<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.789> mind<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.390> water

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
those lines but keep in mind the water

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
those lines but keep in mind the water
is<00:00:51.930> only<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.949> certain<00:00:53.309> areas<00:00:53.399> or

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is only going to be in certain areas or

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
is only going to be in certain areas or
possibly<00:00:54.480> even<00:00:54.570> certain<00:00:55.079> maps<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.770> do

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
possibly even certain maps if they do

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
possibly even certain maps if they do
bring<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> online<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> an

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
bring it online so it's more of an

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
bring it online so it's more of an
obstacle<00:00:57.840> than<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> mechanic<00:00:58.890> moving<00:00:59.399> right

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
obstacle than a mechanic moving right

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
obstacle than a mechanic moving right
along<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.969> skip<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> few<00:01:00.390> frames<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
along if we skip a few frames we see a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
along if we skip a few frames we see a
mecha<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.920> Bionic<00:01:02.430> hand<00:01:02.640> come<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.000> which<00:01:03.359> then

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
mecha or Bionic hand come out which then

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
mecha or Bionic hand come out which then
changes<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> death<00:01:04.320> machine<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.309> could

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
changes to a death machine so this could

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.710 
changes to a death machine so this could
just<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> animation<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> death

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
just be the animation for the death

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
just be the animation for the death
machine<00:01:06.900> very<00:01:07.350> well<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.220> also<00:01:08.250> be

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
machine very well but it could also be

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
machine very well but it could also be
some<00:01:08.880> new<00:01:09.030> type<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> weapon<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> few

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
some new type of weapon then a few

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
some new type of weapon then a few
frames<00:01:10.770> later<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> mecha<00:01:11.850> hand<00:01:12.150> once

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
frames later you see a mecha hand once

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
frames later you see a mecha hand once
again<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.110> time<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.619> sends<00:01:13.950> forth<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
again but this time it sends forth a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.179 
again but this time it sends forth a
swarm<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> mechanical<00:01:15.869> bugs<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.650> thinking

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
swarm of mechanical bugs so I'm thinking

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.920 
swarm of mechanical bugs so I'm thinking
that<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> probably<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> animation

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that this is probably just the animation

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
that this is probably just the animation
for<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> killstreaks<00:01:19.799> since<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.369> arm<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
for the killstreaks since your arm is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
for the killstreaks since your arm is
kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> link<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> technology<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.080> sort

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
kind of link to technology and that sort

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
kind of link to technology and that sort
of<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.820> sliding

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of thing right here you can see sliding

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
of thing right here you can see sliding
is<00:01:24.509> making<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.080> return<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> mechanic<00:01:26.280> here

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is making a return as a mechanic here

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.100 
is making a return as a mechanic here
we've<00:01:26.759> got<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.270> sick<00:01:27.570> Assassin's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
we've got this really sick Assassin's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
with the characters and their look so

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
with the characters and their look so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this is a big deal for me honestly an

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
this is a big deal for me honestly an
advanced<00:01:37.439> warfare<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.640> outfits<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
advanced warfare all the outfits and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.960 
advanced warfare all the outfits and
customization<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:41.070> bad<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.670> I'm

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
customization was pretty bad so I'm

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
customization was pretty bad so I'm
pretty<00:01:42.240> excited<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> here's<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> guy

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
pretty excited for this here's a guy

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.230 
pretty excited for this here's a guy
taking<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> drone<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.700> again<00:01:44.909> could<00:01:45.090> be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
taking out a drone which again could be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
taking out a drone which again could be
a<00:01:45.270> kill<00:01:45.540> streak<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.950> where<00:01:47.490> our

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a kill streak and this is where our

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
a kill streak and this is where our
slide<00:01:48.090> comes<00:01:48.420> into<00:01:48.780> play<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.649> tell

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
slide comes into play as you can tell

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.109 
slide comes into play as you can tell
this<00:01:49.920> character<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.460> slid<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this character just slid under this

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.569 
this character just slid under this
animatronic<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.170> its<00:01:52.290> weak<00:01:52.530> point<00:01:52.829> seems<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
animatronic and its weak point seems to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
animatronic and its weak point seems to
be<00:01:53.670> underneath<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.600> sliding

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
be underneath it so that's sliding

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.170 
be underneath it so that's sliding
mobility<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> allow<00:01:56.790> us<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
mobility really is going to allow us to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.789 
mobility really is going to allow us to
reach<00:01:57.420> their<00:01:57.719> weak<00:01:57.899> point<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
reach their weak point and I have a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
reach their weak point and I have a
feeling<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.250> traversing<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.329> just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
feeling that traversing and just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.209 
feeling that traversing and just
generally<00:02:01.110> moving<00:02:01.439> around<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
generally moving around is going to be a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.950 
generally moving around is going to be a
lot<00:02:02.430> different<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.180> game<00:02:03.420> because

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
lot different in this game because

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.209 
lot different in this game because
there's<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.350> opportunities<00:02:04.890> such

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
there's going to be opportunities such

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.889 
there's going to be opportunities such
as<00:02:05.280> weak<00:02:05.610> points<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.060> things<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.689> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
as weak points and things like this that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
as weak points and things like this that
we<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.369> here's<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:08.789> form

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
we can use them with so here's some form

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
we can use them with so here's some form
of<00:02:09.119> artillery<00:02:09.479> followed<00:02:09.959> by<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> warthog<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.860> we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
of artillery followed by a warthog so we

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
of artillery followed by a warthog so we
might<00:02:11.129> actually<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.489> seen<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.030> game<00:02:12.390> vehicles

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
might actually be seen in game vehicles

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.460 
might actually be seen in game vehicles
this<00:02:13.020> time

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this time

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930 
this time
which<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.830> could<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.160> having<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.520> lot<00:02:14.790> of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
which I could see having a lot of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.570 
which I could see having a lot of
potential<00:02:15.210> online<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.870> holy<00:02:16.530> shit<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
potential online and holy shit we have

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.520 
potential online and holy shit we have
wall<00:02:17.940> running<00:02:18.210> personally<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.080> thought<00:02:19.350> wall

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
wall running personally I thought wall

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.560 
wall running personally I thought wall
running<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.010> titanfall<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.730> absolutely<00:02:21.420> epic

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
running in titanfall was absolutely epic

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.210 
running in titanfall was absolutely epic
so<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.290> seeing<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.650> black<00:02:22.890> ops<00:02:23.100> 3

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
so we will be seeing in black ops 3

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.060 
so we will be seeing in black ops 3
which<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:23.880> sweet<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.450> shockwave<00:02:25.350> punches<00:02:25.830> are

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
which is sweet and shockwave punches are

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.860 
which is sweet and shockwave punches are
back<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.760> here's<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> part<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.660> trailer

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
back but here's the part of the trailer

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.110 
back but here's the part of the trailer
where<00:02:28.110> all<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> moaning<00:02:29.100> comes<00:02:29.370> into<00:02:29.820> play

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
where all of the moaning comes into play

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.840 
where all of the moaning comes into play
they<00:02:30.720> don't<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.380> exosuits<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.460> i<00:02:32.610> said

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
they don't have exosuits like i said

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.640 
they don't have exosuits like i said
earlier<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.630> they<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.620> are

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
earlier but what they do have or are

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.980 
earlier but what they do have or are
introducing<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.730> cheap<00:02:36.270> knockoff<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
introducing is a cheap knockoff of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.900 
introducing is a cheap knockoff of
boosting<00:02:37.530> called<00:02:37.800> thrust<00:02:38.160> jumping<00:02:38.670> which

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
boosting called thrust jumping which

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.730 
boosting called thrust jumping which
from<00:02:39.210> what<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.540> tell<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.050> nullified<00:02:40.470> in

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
from what I can tell is nullified in

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.380 
from what I can tell is nullified in
comparison<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> excess<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> I'm

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
comparison to the excess you and I'm

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.030 
comparison to the excess you and I'm
pretty<00:02:42.570> sure<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.050> only<00:02:43.200> thrust<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.830> Joel

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
pretty sure you can only thrust or Joel

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520 
pretty sure you can only thrust or Joel
forward<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:44.880> at<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.240> moment<00:02:45.300> there's<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.110> lot

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
forward but at this moment there's a lot

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.710 
forward but at this moment there's a lot
of<00:02:46.560> controversy<00:02:47.370> going<00:02:47.610> around<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.270> if<00:02:48.450> they

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
of controversy going around so if they

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.540 
of controversy going around so if they
did<00:02:48.870> enough<00:02:49.050> complaints<00:02:49.620> I'm<00:02:49.890> sure<00:02:50.400> it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
did enough complaints I'm sure it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.160 
did enough complaints I'm sure it's
possible<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.120> treyarch<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:52.020> out

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
possible that treyarch would take out

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.140 
possible that treyarch would take out
this<00:02:52.320> mechanic<00:02:52.860> since<00:02:53.280> they<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.580> cater<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.060> the
