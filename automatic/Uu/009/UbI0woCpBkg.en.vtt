that<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> pretty<00:01:16.049> awesome<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:17.610> think

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that is pretty awesome I don't think

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.499 
that is pretty awesome I don't think
that<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.360> Bo<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.740> previous<00:01:20.509> update

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that was well Bo in the previous update

and<00:01:35.939> all<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.439> start<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

settings so you can sort by kilobytes or

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
settings so you can sort by kilobytes or
megabytes<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.210> always<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.659> been

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
think it's been having a speed test has

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
think it's been having a speed test has
been<00:02:05.700> having<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> same<00:02:06.299> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> look

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

Oh Joe<00:02:12.630> something<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.230> Android<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.190> let's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
Oh Joe something of Android so let's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.600 
Oh Joe something of Android so let's
also<00:02:14.670> try<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:16.260> begin<00:02:16.620> some<00:02:17.190> testing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
also try it here to begin some testing

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.540 
also try it here to begin some testing
and<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.090> how<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.450> looks<00:02:18.480> how<00:02:19.380> more<00:02:19.620> how<00:02:20.370> much

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and see how it looks how more how much

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.860 
and see how it looks how more how much
more<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.940> great<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.660> awesome<00:02:22.290> lucky<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> has

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.700 

so<00:02:27.870> not<00:02:28.440> super<00:02:28.770> good<00:02:28.920> speeds<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.490> about<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
so not super good speeds here about a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.340 
so not super good speeds here about a
you<00:02:31.710> can't<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.130> everything<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.350> can't

everything I love that much better

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.010 
everything I love that much better
speeds<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.160> yeah<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.400> sucks<00:02:41.640> me<00:02:41.910> me<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.720> X<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
speeds but yeah it sucks me me so X to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.160 
speeds but yeah it sucks me me so X to
me<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:44.540> hmm<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:47.070> can't<00:02:47.280> remove<00:02:47.550> ads<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.170> but

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
me me hmm you can't remove ads here but

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.479 
me me hmm you can't remove ads here but
then<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.500> course<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.040> pay<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> little

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
then you of course have to pay a little

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.240 
then you of course have to pay a little
bit<00:02:50.610> yeah<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:52.050> too<00:02:52.320> much<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.890> use<00:02:52.920> on

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
bit yeah not too much but if you use on

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.150 
bit yeah not too much but if you use on
a<00:02:53.310> daily<00:02:53.489> basis<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.380> how<00:02:55.380> easily<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:55.950> fall

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
a daily basis a how easily they fall

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
a daily basis a how easily they fall
that<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.940> can<00:02:57.060> see<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> small<00:02:57.390> oh<00:02:57.510> add

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that because you can see a small oh add

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:21.020 
that because you can see a small oh add
down<00:02:58.080> there<00:03:14.510> d<00:03:19.250> let's<00:03:20.250> try<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> do<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
down there d let's try to do it the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:32.020 
down there d let's try to do it the
final<00:03:21.269> time<00:03:21.600> here

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.150 

maybe<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:33.020> got<00:03:33.110> some<00:03:33.290> accurate<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.770> better

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
maybe we got some accurate to better

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.480 
maybe we got some accurate to better
score<00:03:34.550> here<00:03:34.760> also<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.920> witnessing<00:03:36.920> update<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
score here also I witnessing update and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.110 
score here also I witnessing update and
but<00:03:38.420> as<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.630> said<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.110> comp<00:03:39.350> fo<00:03:39.709> sho<00:03:39.980> but<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:40.970> looks

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
but as I said a comp fo sho but it looks

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.970 
but as I said a comp fo sho but it looks
pretty<00:03:41.209> stable<00:03:41.510> when<00:03:42.140> I'm<00:03:42.230> testing<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.770> I

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
pretty stable when I'm testing here I

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.940 
pretty stable when I'm testing here I
don't<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:44.000> any<00:03:44.180> major<00:03:44.420> downs<00:03:44.959> or<00:03:45.470> anything

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
don't see any major downs or anything

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.640 
don't see any major downs or anything
and<00:03:46.630> probably<00:03:47.630> know<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.110> make<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.260> proper

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and probably know it can make a proper

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.190 
and probably know it can make a proper
video<00:03:48.800> compared<00:03:49.280> against<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.670> eye<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:50.060> 7<00:03:50.420> SB
