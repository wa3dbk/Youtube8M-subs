martial<00:01:13.760> arts<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:15.460> our<00:01:16.460> approach<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:16.970> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
martial arts but our approach is a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.399 
martial arts but our approach is a
little<00:01:17.270> bit<00:01:17.390> different<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.840> love<00:01:17.900> note<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
little bit different I love note that a

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.140 
little bit different I love note that a
second<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:20.240> other<00:01:20.480> suite<00:01:21.190> takes<00:01:22.190> him<00:01:22.430> does

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
second the other suite takes him does

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.820 
second the other suite takes him does
the<00:01:23.300> same<00:01:23.480> thing<00:01:23.750> pretty<00:01:23.990> much<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.470> back<00:01:24.650> of

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
physical mobility I have seen exceptions

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.150 
physical mobility I have seen exceptions
that<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.140> usually<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.470> really<00:02:41.739> big<00:02:41.980> guy

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
that it's usually a really big guy

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.220 
that it's usually a really big guy
against<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.549> smaller<00:02:42.849> guy<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.780> he<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:43.989> sweep

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
against a smaller guy and he can sweep

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.600 
against a smaller guy and he can sweep
out<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.410> back<00:02:44.680> leg<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:44.950> knock<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> guy<00:02:45.400> down

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
out the back leg and knock the guy down

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.220 
out the back leg and knock the guy down
but<00:02:45.819> usually<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.599> good<00:02:46.750> idea<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.110> do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
but usually it's not a good idea to do

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.430 
but usually it's not a good idea to do
so<00:02:48.100> all<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> do<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.359> visual<00:02:50.260> reference

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
so all I do is I make a visual reference

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.710 
so all I do is I make a visual reference

so base foot nice and deep this leg
comes<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.900> mix<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.200> swooping<00:03:39.560> motion<00:03:39.620> you

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
comes a mix of swooping motion you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.970 
comes a mix of swooping motion you
combine<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.000> with<00:03:41.210> your<00:03:41.480> arm<00:03:41.690> gesture<00:03:42.290> and
