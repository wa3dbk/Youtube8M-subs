okay<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.510> tutorial<00:00:03.689> I'm<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
okay so in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay so in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.859> can<00:00:05.100> create<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.460> strap

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
show you how you can create a strap

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.450 
show you how you can create a strap
simply<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:06.930> curves<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:08.010> if<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.160> start<00:00:08.400> with

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
simply with curves so if you start with

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
simply with curves so if you start with
going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.849> grade<00:00:09.800> EP<00:00:10.800> curve<00:00:11.540> go<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> your<00:00:12.870> front

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
going to grade EP curve go to your front

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.740 
going to grade EP curve go to your front
view<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.179> draw<00:00:15.859> your<00:00:16.859> shape<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.029> strap

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
view and draw your shape of the strap

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620 
view and draw your shape of the strap
like<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.560> maybe<00:00:20.119> go<00:00:21.119> back<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> your

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
like this maybe go back to your

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
like this maybe go back to your
perspective<00:00:21.810> view<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.420> simply<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> right

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
perspective view and simply have a right

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.210 
perspective view and simply have a right
filling<00:00:25.050> control<00:00:25.410> vertices<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> can

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
filling control vertices and you can

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.259 
filling control vertices and you can
change<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> shape<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> looks<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.560> smooth

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
change the shape so it looks more smooth

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.319 
change the shape so it looks more smooth
now<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> create<00:00:31.260> NURBS<00:00:32.099> circle

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
now you can go to create NURBS circle

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.040 
now you can go to create NURBS circle
circle<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> simply<00:00:35.340> draw<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.969> circle<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.690> then

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
circle and simply draw a circle and then

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
circle and simply draw a circle and then
scale<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> looks<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
scale it down so it looks more like a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.690 
scale it down so it looks more like a
strap<00:00:38.850> okay<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.980> shape<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
strap okay now we want this shape to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.459 
strap okay now we want this shape to
follow<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> path<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:42.989> select<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
follow the path so if we select the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.150 
follow the path so if we select the
shape<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.190> path<00:00:44.539> go<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> surface<00:00:46.910> surface

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
shape the path go to surface surface

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.200 
shape the path go to surface surface
extrude<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.460> options<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
extrude with options this is the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
extrude with options this is the
standard<00:00:54.570> look<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
standard look so we want to we want it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
standard look so we want to we want it
to<00:00:56.370> start<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> path<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to start at the path and we want to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
to start at the path and we want to
follow<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> path<00:00:58.559> hit<00:00:59.010> apply

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
follow it the path hit apply

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.200 
follow it the path hit apply
and<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> shape<00:01:01.079> follows<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> path<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and now the shape follows the path so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
and now the shape follows the path so
now<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.610> we

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
now if we think we want it to be more we

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
now if we think we want it to be more we
simply<00:01:06.299> change<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> circle<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:10.220> okay

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
simply change the circle like this okay

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510 
simply change the circle like this okay
so<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> outliner<00:01:13.220> simply<00:01:14.220> select

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so go up in the outliner simply select

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
so go up in the outliner simply select
the<00:01:14.640> curve<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.390> hide<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the curve we're gonna hide this for a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.700 
the curve we're gonna hide this for a
moment<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.350> ctrl<00:01:16.740> H<00:01:17.689> okay<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
moment so ctrl H okay so now we want to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.420 
moment so ctrl H okay so now we want to
give<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.700> clusters<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.680> set<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
give it some clusters so if we set like

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.170 
give it some clusters so if we set like
the<00:01:23.700> start<00:01:24.090> point<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.500> surface<00:01:26.000> go<00:01:27.000> up

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the start point go up to surface go up

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.350 
the start point go up to surface go up
to<00:01:27.299> animation<00:01:27.780> create<00:01:28.530> deformers<00:01:29.360> cluster

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to animation create deformers cluster

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.530 
to animation create deformers cluster
and<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.130> every<00:01:32.540> put

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and we're gonna do that with every put

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620 
and we're gonna do that with every put
everything<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.070> simply<00:01:35.369> hit<00:01:35.490> G<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
everything so you can simply hit G the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.249 
everything so you can simply hit G the
last<00:01:36.869> action<00:01:38.780> like<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 

and<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.490> able<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:45.000> two

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and if you want to be able to move two

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
and if you want to be able to move two
points<00:01:45.539> later<00:01:45.719> on<00:01:45.930> after<00:01:46.289> you<00:01:46.320> constrain<00:01:46.950> them

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
points later on after you constrain them

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.950 
points later on after you constrain them
you<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> group<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.360> them<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.869> if

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you have to make a group for them so if

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.429 
you have to make a group for them so if
we<00:01:49.049> select<00:01:49.229> each<00:01:50.479> cluster<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.869> simply<00:01:52.259> greet

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we select each cluster and simply greet

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.010 
we select each cluster and simply greet
them<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> group<00:01:54.289> control<00:01:55.289> G<00:01:55.469> control<00:01:56.100> gene

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
them it's a group control G control gene

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
them it's a group control G control gene
and<00:01:58.020> control<00:01:58.560> G<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.759> now<00:01:59.789> every<00:02:00.210> cluster<00:02:00.479> has<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and control G so now every cluster has a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.120 
and control G so now every cluster has a
group<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.009> simply<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:02.729> two<00:02:04.130> select

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
group and now we simply take two select

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.789 
group and now we simply take two select
this<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.539> go<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> animation

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this it's like this go to animation

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.979 
this it's like this go to animation
constrain<00:02:08.550> parent<00:02:09.119> constrain<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.720> menu

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
constrain parent constrain with menu

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.550 
constrain parent constrain with menu
chain<00:02:10.229> offset<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:13.319> we're<00:02:13.410> going

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
chain offset like this and we're going

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.789 
chain offset like this and we're going
to<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.069> group<00:02:14.280> 7<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.580> hit<00:02:18.239> G

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
to do that for group 7 as well and hit G

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.390 
to do that for group 7 as well and hit G
constraint<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:21.360> gonna<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.810> for

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.630 

for<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> V<00:02:27.470> cluster<00:02:29.569> like<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.430> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
for a V cluster like this so now we a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.970 
for a V cluster like this so now we a
parent<00:02:33.090> constrain<00:02:33.450> them<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.739> group

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
parent constrain them to the group

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.860 
parent constrain them to the group
itself<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.239> when<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.450> move<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
itself like this so now when we move the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
itself like this so now when we move the
box<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.829> clusters<00:02:41.250> follow

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
box the clusters follow

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.349 
box the clusters follow
so<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.299> we<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.569> unhide<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.739> strap<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> now

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
so now we can unhide the strap and now

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.050 
so now we can unhide the strap and now
we<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> strap<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:50.489> we<00:02:50.579> can<00:02:50.730> simply

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
we have a strap so now we can simply

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.099 
we have a strap so now we can simply
hide<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.450> curve<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:57.180> spline<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.900> this

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
hide the curve and the spline like this

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.890 
hide the curve and the spline like this
here<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.670> now<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> strap<00:03:00.359> so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
here we go so now we have a strap so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.840 
here we go so now we have a strap so
when<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.440> move<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.889> case<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.760> nothing

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
when you move the case and nothing

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.759 
when you move the case and nothing
happens<00:03:03.359> it's<00:03:03.569> follows<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.410> could<00:03:04.560> still

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
happens it's follows but you could still

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.309 
happens it's follows but you could still
change<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.670> by<00:03:05.790> moving<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.239> clusters<00:03:06.720> so

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
change it just by moving the clusters so

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.750 
change it just by moving the clusters so
the<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.769> want<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> shape<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.609> more

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the like you want the shape to be more

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.040 
the like you want the shape to be more
like<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.590> still<00:03:10.769> Falls
