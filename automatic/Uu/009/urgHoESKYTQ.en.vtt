00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
quality of an animated feature film of

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.410 
quality of an animated feature film of
course<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.830> looks<00:03:17.860> amazing<00:03:18.820> from<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.060> technical

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
course it looks amazing from a technical

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.480 
course it looks amazing from a technical
standpoint<00:03:19.720> if<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.590> was<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.890> comment<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
standpoint if I was to comment on the

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.670 
standpoint if I was to comment on the
style<00:03:21.790> I'd<00:03:22.360> say<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:22.990> wasn't<00:03:23.320> as

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
style I'd say that this wasn't as

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.320 
style I'd say that this wasn't as
visually<00:03:24.190> appealing<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.790> last<00:03:25.000> movie

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
visually appealing as the last movie

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.390 
visually appealing as the last movie
that<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.480> reviewed<00:03:25.870> well<00:03:26.230> children<00:03:26.800> it's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
that I reviewed well children it's

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.490 
that I reviewed well children it's
obvious<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:27.940> Hiroyuki<00:03:28.570> Okura<00:03:29.080> was<00:03:29.260> going

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
obvious that Hiroyuki Okura was going

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.200 
obvious that Hiroyuki Okura was going
towards<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.950> more<00:03:30.190> realistic<00:03:30.520> look<00:03:30.760> with<00:03:31.060> this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
towards a more realistic look with this

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.030 
towards a more realistic look with this
film<00:03:31.480> except<00:03:31.990> for<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.260> mother<00:03:32.470> Momo<00:03:33.010> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
film except for the mother Momo and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.100 
film except for the mother Momo and
other<00:03:33.460> kids<00:03:33.760> all<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.420> side<00:03:34.660> characters

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
other kids all the side characters

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.350 
other kids all the side characters
really<00:03:35.470> look<00:03:35.890> Japanese<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.790> all<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> facial

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
really look Japanese and all the facial

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.420 
really look Japanese and all the facial
features<00:03:37.540> are<00:03:38.020> very<00:03:38.350> refined<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.070> characters

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
features are very refined and characters

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.130 
features are very refined and characters
make<00:03:39.580> strong<00:03:39.850> expression<00:03:40.390> again<00:03:40.900> from<00:03:41.050> a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
make strong expression again from a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.380 
make strong expression again from a
technical<00:03:41.560> view<00:03:41.740> this<00:03:42.160> is<00:03:42.430> impressive<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.240> I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
technical view this is impressive but I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.540 
technical view this is impressive but I
didn't<00:03:43.960> really<00:03:44.080> like<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.350> at<00:03:44.950> least<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:45.460> the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
didn't really like it at least in the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.280 
didn't really like it at least in the
beginning<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:46.210> course<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.810> used<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
beginning of course you get used to it

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.200 
beginning of course you get used to it
and<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:47.980> only<00:03:48.100> praise<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.670> backgrounds

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
and I can only praise the backgrounds

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.930 
and I can only praise the backgrounds
animation<00:03:50.080> top-notch<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.100> can<00:03:51.430> imagine<00:03:51.730> that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
animation top-notch I can imagine that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.580 
animation top-notch I can imagine that
animating<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.660> more<00:03:52.900> realistic<00:03:53.200> looking

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
animating these more realistic looking

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.080 
animating these more realistic looking
characters<00:03:54.010> was<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.190> challenge<00:03:54.640> on<00:03:54.790> its<00:03:54.910> own

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
characters was a challenge on its own

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210 
characters was a challenge on its own
and<00:03:55.330> they<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:56.200> did<00:03:56.350> not<00:03:56.500> cut<00:03:56.800> any<00:03:56.950> corners

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
and they really did not cut any corners

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.420 
and they really did not cut any corners
with<00:03:57.520> that<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.060> music<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:59.040> didn't<00:04:00.040> really

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
with that the music I didn't really

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.490 
with that the music I didn't really
notice<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.820> music<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.360> course<00:04:02.110> there<00:04:02.290> are

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
notice the music of course there are

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.140 
notice the music of course there are
emotional<00:04:03.130> ups<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.610> lows<00:04:03.760> which<00:04:04.000> are

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
emotional ups and lows which are

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150 
emotional ups and lows which are
accompanied<00:04:04.570> by<00:04:04.600> musical<00:04:05.170> pieces<00:04:05.380> but<00:04:05.830> except

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
accompanied by musical pieces but except

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.670 
accompanied by musical pieces but except
for<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.460> sweet<00:04:06.760> ending<00:04:07.270> song<00:04:07.510> nothing<00:04:08.500> really

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
for the sweet ending song nothing really

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.590 
for the sweet ending song nothing really
stuck<00:04:09.070> in<00:04:09.220> my<00:04:09.250> head<00:04:09.580> though<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> would<00:04:10.390> rather

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
stuck in my head though I would rather

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.210 
stuck in my head though I would rather
be<00:04:10.750> positive<00:04:11.410> towards<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:11.800> soundtrack

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
be positive towards the soundtrack

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.560 
be positive towards the soundtrack
because<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.490> really<00:04:12.730> wasn't<00:04:12.910> bad<00:04:13.240> or

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
because it really wasn't bad or

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.050 
because it really wasn't bad or
distracting<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> life<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.160> me<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.550> can't

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
distracting for the life of me I can't

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.700 
distracting for the life of me I can't
really<00:04:16.239> remember<00:04:16.480> how<00:04:16.960> the<00:04:17.020> climactic<00:04:17.440> race

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
really remember how the climactic race

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.620 
really remember how the climactic race
against<00:04:18.070> time<00:04:18.130> sounded<00:04:18.730> like<00:04:18.850> but<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.480> know

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
against time sounded like but I know

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.040 
against time sounded like but I know
that<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.900> did<00:04:20.080> not<00:04:20.200> sound<00:04:20.530> bad

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.170 

so<00:04:28.050> here's<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.350> stuff<00:04:28.580> for<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.670> majority<00:04:30.150> of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
so here's a stuff for the majority of

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.480 
so here's a stuff for the majority of
this<00:04:30.420> film<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.870> could<00:04:31.260> not<00:04:31.440> understand<00:04:31.980> what<00:04:32.250> it

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
this film I could not understand what it

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.080 
this film I could not understand what it
was<00:04:32.670> about

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
was about

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.750 
was about
in<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.900> beginning<00:04:34.290> of<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> story<00:04:34.710> Momo<00:04:35.610> is

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
in the beginning of the story Momo is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.220 
in the beginning of the story Momo is
separating<00:04:36.420> herself<00:04:36.570> or<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.900> people<00:04:37.200> around

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
separating herself or the people around

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.200 
separating herself or the people around
her<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.920> obviously<00:04:38.310> knew<00:04:38.850> he<00:04:39.000> was<00:04:39.180> a

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
her so I obviously knew he was a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.970 
her so I obviously knew he was a
coming-of-age<00:04:39.630> tale<00:04:40.080> where<00:04:40.500> she<00:04:40.710> would<00:04:40.860> learn

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
coming-of-age tale where she would learn

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.980 
coming-of-age tale where she would learn
to<00:04:41.160> appreciate<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.700> change<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.180> get<00:04:42.660> over

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
to appreciate the change and get over

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.420 
to appreciate the change and get over
her<00:04:43.170> guilt<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:43.980> couldn't<00:04:44.340> really

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
her guilt but I couldn't really

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.030 
her guilt but I couldn't really
understand<00:04:44.940> how<00:04:45.150> or<00:04:45.480> why<00:04:46.050> any<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.890> events

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
understand how or why any of the events

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.950 
understand how or why any of the events
happening<00:04:47.310> will<00:04:47.730> lead<00:04:47.910> us<00:04:48.030> closer<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.570> that<00:04:48.720> I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
happening will lead us closer to that I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.180 
happening will lead us closer to that I
felt<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.560> till<00:04:49.740> about<00:04:49.920> halfway

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
felt like this till about halfway

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.070 
felt like this till about halfway
through<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.670> film<00:04:50.940> until<00:04:51.450> some<00:04:51.660> drama<00:04:51.930> is

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
through the film until some drama is

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.540 
through the film until some drama is
finally<00:04:52.440> introduced<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.950> then<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.310> movie

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
finally introduced and then the movie

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.130 
finally introduced and then the movie
became<00:04:53.790> clear<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.090> me<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.600> structure<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.050> this

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
became clear to me the structure of this

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.380 
became clear to me the structure of this
