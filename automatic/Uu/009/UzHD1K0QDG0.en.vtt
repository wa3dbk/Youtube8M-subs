design<00:00:00.510> parameters<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.709> we<00:00:02.550> considered

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
design parameters that we considered

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.740 
design parameters that we considered
when<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:04.040> when<00:00:05.040> we<00:00:05.069> laid<00:00:05.400> out<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.730> organ<00:00:06.450> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
when we when we laid out the organ and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.839 
when we when we laid out the organ and
that<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.830> would<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.130> laid<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.639> in

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
that was that it would be laid out in

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.790 
that was that it would be laid out in
such<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> way<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.840> could<00:00:10.080> bring<00:00:10.320> groups<00:00:10.620> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
such a way that we could bring groups of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890 
such a way that we could bring groups of
people<00:00:11.010> through<00:00:11.969> here

reservoirs in this organ the reservoir
has<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.689> functions<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.549> function<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
has two functions the first function is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.679 
has two functions the first function is
that<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> stores<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:51.290> large<00:01:52.290> volume<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
that it stores a large volume of

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.539 
that it stores a large volume of
pressurized<00:01:54.689> air<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.619> use<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> pipes

above<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.409> second<00:01:58.860> function<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.570> that<00:02:00.570> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
above and the second function is that it

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
little round tacks on them those are all

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.020 
little round tacks on them those are all
little<00:04:21.630> electromagnets<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:24.280> what<00:04:24.430> happens<00:04:24.850> is

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
little electromagnets so what happens is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.090 
little electromagnets so what happens is
that<00:04:25.210> electromagnet<00:04:26.080> vincent<00:04:26.500> receives<00:04:26.890> a

that electromagnet vincent receives a
little<00:04:27.370> signal<00:04:27.630> allows<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.660> valve<00:04:29.169> to<00:04:29.350> open

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
little signal allows a valve to open

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.020 
little signal allows a valve to open
only<00:04:29.980> about<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.370> 64th<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.360> an<00:04:31.480> inch<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:33.310> causes

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
only about a 64th of an inch that causes

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.860 
only about a 64th of an inch that causes
an<00:04:34.270> internal<00:04:35.110> pneumatic<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:36.280> collapse<00:04:36.870> which

an internal pneumatic to collapse which

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.200 
an internal pneumatic to collapse which
then<00:04:38.110> causes<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.710> chain<00:04:39.100> reaction<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.970> other

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
then causes a chain reaction of other

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.340 
then causes a chain reaction of other
pneumatics<00:04:40.900> inside<00:04:41.560> here<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.669> open<00:04:42.910> up
