00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.359 
problem with companions in Skyrim some
of<00:00:09.070> you<00:00:09.249> have<00:00:09.759> maybe<00:00:10.499> recognized<00:00:11.499> that<00:00:12.219> if

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
of you have maybe recognized that if

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.170 
of you have maybe recognized that if
you're<00:00:12.579> playing<00:00:13.030> a<00:00:13.269> character<00:00:13.480> and<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:16.150> have

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
you're playing a character and you have

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.950 
you're playing a character and you have
some<00:00:16.750> companions<00:00:17.620> and<00:00:17.800> you<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:19.150> just<00:00:19.420> switch

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
some companions and you you just switch

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.230 
some companions and you you just switch
between<00:00:20.200> them<00:00:20.710> there<00:00:21.460> carry<00:00:21.880> weights

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
between them there carry weights

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.000 
between them there carry weights
decreases<00:00:23.110> and<00:00:23.380> this<00:00:24.370> is<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.820> standard<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:26.010> 300

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
decreases and this is a standard of 300

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.910 
decreases and this is a standard of 300
but<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.480> problem<00:00:28.840> is<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.020> every<00:00:29.620> time<00:00:29.800> you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
but the problem is that every time you

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.030 
but the problem is that every time you
change<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.250> character<00:00:30.820> they<00:00:31.390> get<00:00:31.600> some

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
change the character they get some

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
change the character they get some
invisible<00:00:33.040> items<00:00:33.400> in<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.670> inventory<00:00:33.940> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
invisible items in the inventory and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.350 
invisible items in the inventory and
that's<00:00:36.130> what<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.310> read<00:00:36.550> in<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.700> forums<00:00:37.180> and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
that's what I read in the forums and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.140 
that's what I read in the forums and
that<00:00:37.960> might<00:00:38.440> cause<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.829> problem<00:00:39.220> that<00:00:40.210> they<00:00:40.960> can

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
that might cause a problem that they can

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.540 
that might cause a problem that they can
carry<00:00:43.150> almost<00:00:43.750> nothing<00:00:44.200> so<00:00:44.950> I'll<00:00:45.220> show<00:00:45.489> you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
carry almost nothing so I'll show you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.900 
carry almost nothing so I'll show you
how<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:45.850> fix<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.950> here<00:00:48.310> we<00:00:48.430> have<00:00:48.550> Lydia

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
how to fix that so here we have Lydia

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.350 
how to fix that so here we have Lydia
and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.260> thing<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.340> need<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.910> console

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
and the thing is you need the console

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.299 
and the thing is you need the console
commands<00:00:52.720> of<00:00:52.960> course<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:53.530> this<00:00:53.680> works<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.160> on

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
commands of course so this works just on

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.150 
commands of course so this works just on
PC<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:55.210> code<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:55.660> need<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:56.050> get<00:00:56.380> AV<00:00:56.739> carry

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
PC the code you need is get AV carry

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.970 
PC the code you need is get AV carry
weight<00:00:57.430> if<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:58.239> click<00:00:58.630> on<00:00:58.809> Lydia<00:00:59.170> first<00:00:59.590> place

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
weight if you click on Lydia first place

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.840 
weight if you click on Lydia first place
so<00:01:00.910> we<00:01:01.120> get<00:01:01.300> her<00:01:01.480> carry<00:01:01.809> weight<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.730> is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
so we get her carry weight and this is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.840 
so we get her carry weight and this is
300<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:05.880> now<00:01:06.880> I'm<00:01:07.150> going<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.170> give<00:01:09.100> here<00:01:09.280> as

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
300 and now I'm going to give here as

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.430 
300 and now I'm going to give here as
much<00:01:10.210> stuff<00:01:10.659> as<00:01:11.100> she<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.400> carry<00:01:12.970> now<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.260> and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
much stuff as she can carry now so and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.859 
much stuff as she can carry now so and
then<00:01:14.770> we<00:01:14.890> will<00:01:15.100> take<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.640> look<00:01:15.790> at<00:01:15.970> how<00:01:16.090> much<00:01:16.330> she

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
then we will take a look at how much she

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
then we will take a look at how much she
really<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:19.799> carry<00:01:21.450> logically<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:24.420> yeah
