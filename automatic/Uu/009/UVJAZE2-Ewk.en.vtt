together<00:00:33.180> collectively<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.230> notice<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.920> use

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
together collectively and notice I use

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
together collectively and notice I use
the<00:00:35.190> term<00:00:35.340> release<00:00:35.700> because<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> lose

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the term release because when you lose

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
the term release because when you lose
weight<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.140> find<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> again<00:00:37.829> absolutely<00:00:38.579> key

weight you find it again absolutely key
so<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> goal<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> establish<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
so the goal is to establish the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
so the goal is to establish the
lifestyle<00:00:41.640> skills<00:00:42.030> through<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> process<00:00:42.989> so

of fat and notice the difference in

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.910 
of fat and notice the difference in
space<00:03:11.889> so<00:03:12.239> fat<00:03:13.239> takes<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.720> much<00:03:13.989> more<00:03:14.230> space<00:03:14.620> you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
space so fat takes a much more space you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920 
space so fat takes a much more space you
know<00:03:15.489> compared<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.000> muscles<00:03:16.329> right<00:03:16.450> goal<00:03:16.750> is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
know compared to muscles right goal is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.449 
know compared to muscles right goal is
to<00:03:17.079> release<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.590> fat<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.160> you're

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
to release the fat and you're

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.250 
to release the fat and you're
automatically<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.389> smaller<00:03:19.450> even

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
automatically going to be smaller even

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.009 
automatically going to be smaller even

mentioned release the fat what do you

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.659 
mentioned release the fat what do you
mean<00:03:35.319> by<00:03:35.440> released<00:03:35.829> you'll<00:03:36.099> see<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.430> burn<00:03:36.639> fat

I<00:03:36.880> was<00:03:37.359> always<00:03:37.630> under<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.019> impression<00:03:38.370> that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
I was always under the impression that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.190 
I was always under the impression that
fat<00:03:39.700> cells<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.180> shrunk<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.810> that's<00:03:41.049> why

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
fat cells just shrunk and that's why

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.170 
fat cells just shrunk and that's why
they<00:03:41.349> come<00:03:41.530> back<00:03:41.739> well<00:03:42.010> they<00:03:42.099> shrink<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:42.970> we

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
they come back well they shrink but we

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.670 
they come back well they shrink but we
are<00:03:43.239> now<00:03:43.480> at<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.720> place<00:03:43.959> where<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.440> have

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
are now at a place where we have

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.860 
are now at a place where we have
discovered<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.489> ultimately<00:03:46.299> we<00:03:46.540> can

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
discovered that ultimately we can

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.490 
discovered that ultimately we can
literally<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:48.340> rid<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:49.060> fat<00:03:49.510> cells<00:03:49.840> so

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
literally get rid of fat cells so

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.289 
literally get rid of fat cells so
ultimately<00:03:50.859> they<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.310> relieve<00:03:51.639> emmy<00:03:51.970> reduce

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
ultimately they can relieve emmy reduce

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.449 
ultimately they can relieve emmy reduce
themselves<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.169> small<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.799> eventually

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
themselves so small and eventually

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.729 
themselves so small and eventually
vanish<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.540> old<00:03:55.720> theory<00:03:56.169> of<00:03:56.319> once<00:03:56.590> you

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
vanish so the old theory of once you

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.170 
vanish so the old theory of once you
have<00:03:56.919> a<00:03:56.950> fast<00:03:57.250> cell<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.609> have<00:03:57.639> it<00:03:57.880> for<00:03:58.030> life

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
have a fast cell you have it for life

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.270 
have a fast cell you have it for life
right<00:03:58.450> well<00:03:58.930> that's<00:03:59.470> not<00:03:59.650> necessarily<00:04:00.130> true

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
right well that's not necessarily true

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.710 
right well that's not necessarily true
the<00:04:00.639> same<00:04:00.849> as<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.030> lot<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.269> people<00:04:01.480> who<00:04:01.540> get

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
the same as a lot of people who get

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.509 
the same as a lot of people who get
married<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.319> know<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:02.769> automatically<00:04:03.190> assume

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
married you know we automatically assume

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.800 
married you know we automatically assume
that<00:04:03.730> we're<00:04:03.849> going<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.000> be<00:04:04.060> together<00:04:04.269> for<00:04:04.780> life

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
that we're going to be together for life

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.930 
that we're going to be together for life
but<00:04:05.410> that's<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:05.650> necessary<00:04:06.250> sarily<00:04:06.760> true

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
but that's not necessary sarily true

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.460 
but that's not necessary sarily true
when<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.120> comes<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.510> my<00:04:07.989> god<00:04:08.169> you<00:04:08.319> girls

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
when it comes of that my god you girls

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.470 
when it comes of that my god you girls
we<00:04:08.769> want<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.040> get<00:04:09.160> rid<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:09.849> we<00:04:10.120> want<00:04:10.299> to

we want to get rid of it and we want to

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.420 
we want to get rid of it and we want to
maintain<00:04:10.660> our<00:04:11.109> muscle<00:04:11.500> because<00:04:11.739> muscle<00:04:12.069> is

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
maintain our muscle because muscle is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.539 
maintain our muscle because muscle is
your<00:04:12.750> metabolism<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.870> over<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.919> years<00:04:15.190> as<00:04:15.370> we

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
your metabolism and over the years as we

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.029 
your metabolism and over the years as we
get<00:04:15.729> older<00:04:15.940> what<00:04:16.600> happens<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:17.109> our<00:04:17.259> metabolism

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
get older what happens is our metabolism

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.440 
get older what happens is our metabolism
doesn't

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
doesn't

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.390 
doesn't
slow<00:04:18.720> necessarily<00:04:19.470> we<00:04:19.830> lose<00:04:20.040> muscle

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
slow necessarily we lose muscle

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.850 
slow necessarily we lose muscle
absolutely<00:04:21.270> as<00:04:21.360> we<00:04:21.480> lose<00:04:21.690> muscle<00:04:21.990> then<00:04:22.710> we're

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
absolutely as we lose muscle then we're

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.860 
absolutely as we lose muscle then we're
gonna<00:04:22.950> hold<00:04:23.280> more<00:04:23.550> body<00:04:23.820> fat<00:04:23.940> that's<00:04:24.600> why<00:04:24.840> i
