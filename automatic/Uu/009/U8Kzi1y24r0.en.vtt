00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.539

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 keep flashback in my face on 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.150
 middle of the game is playing 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 and the case that it is there that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.729
 floor 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.439
 guys, sincerely you're a fan because 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 You do this instead of playing 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.450
 Do you want to earn youtube respect? 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.729
 there is not that people have the attitude in 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 I'm just leaving, I 'm your fan and such. 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 we will play in the lobby time we 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.729

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.210
 With me in the lobby, we'll chat 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.890

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 There's always an asshole to do shit. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 to play flash right in your face 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 So the staff ask you not to do it. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 That's when I came back to play a game. 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.640
 gave that support there that he has made me 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.280
 I wish I never had so much desire 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 to play pv while having it now 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 the last time you've been very 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 It was when I went to turn imagemos 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.630
 that after all everyone who 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.250
 but the beret is just now 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 very excited even playing with everything 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.969
 that's right 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.649
 the first more people than I 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.420
 I want to talk, do not I mention the bottom line and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.340
 such as what matters in the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.110
 is that I said that I had done the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.590
 last request to talk about it 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.019
 and 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.629
 I'll talk again, because I was 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.290
 doing that last week taking a break 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.849
 school work to do 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.110
 evidence and such I was a little guilty 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.090
 I was having a lot of time to do 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 video of other things what I was 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.629
 playing was then infestation any 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 thing a game of time has led to 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.440
 record a video because it was too much pvp 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.769
 so I just listened for more time in the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 channel you have already repaired and the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.230
 love we will also talk of the videos 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.110
 guys 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:50.880
 the channel series a &amp; e type off state of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.790
 the key made three will continue 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.590
 only a random way I'll try 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.480
 make as much as possible to comply with 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.519
 calendar is you know the days of 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
 video then knowing what it wants with 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.590
 these series knowing video day you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.390
 are you going to arrive or will you be back? 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.220
 I do not know if I will be able to comply 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.140
 exactly the time is because after all 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.370
 accounts still get a little guilty but 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.840
 now that I have finished practically 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.400
 I study in this photo the dependence of 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.760
 mathematician who is a mercenary does not 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.250
 Teacher, I'm not going to have more time. 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.799
 maybe I can keep the date 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.290
 of these type series occurred asserts 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.840
 tuesday wednesday state of the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.660
 cage night grandson from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.489
 Brasilia time there on Thursday 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.799
 It's going to be any video and on Friday 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.410
 I'm going to try to put the dead space on the 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.090
 Monday the droid at 2 on Thursday 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.370
 fair offering three new series more 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.959
 varied we'll see how it goes but 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.930
 This is the standard I want to keep 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.370
 I could not post the video on the day I 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.930
 I hope you understand that it is 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.060
 because I was busy 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.780
 I have my things to do too. 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.310
 work has a lot of video to edit and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.680
 also to the tyrant saucer at the point break 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.450
 is in a new format as well in the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.769
 world in format had that format 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.569
 above is type 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.549
 formerly a compilation of several 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.200
 things that I recorded all day 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.900
 Nowadays it's not so easy to do 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.139
 so even a shot is shot in the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.970
 breast a month out there at most two 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.169
 I want to make a new format by taking 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.320
 saucer I can at least make 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.090
 three to four a month who knows three in the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.979
 I think I can handle three more rumors 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.290
 I can not guarantee anything but I can 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.780
 do 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.780
 year 1 cf the time the galley 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.060
 relaxed and stayed the year I already have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.920
 done here will be like this now a cef 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.620
 well crazy so pretty much crazy 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.890
 editing gets better at making it beautiful there 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.780
 memes subtitles a soundtrack that the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.040
 youtube not from fred i'm going to have to 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.560
 Enriching will now have to be 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.180
 careful about it and here goes I want to do 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.770
 this series so I'll try 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.010
 bring mascherano saucer on point blank 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.990
 href 4 on the channel I do not know how it's going to be 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.330
 and it will be a bit frequent right now 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.250
 I do not have much to play with and 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.540
 chimbinha when I call he will not 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.980
 When he goes to play, he will not call me. 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.410
 The crew does not have much trouble. 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.180
 recording bs-4 is crashing 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.150
 a lot on my pc when you tried to burn 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.070
 because a processor gives very much 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.020
 bottleneck the guy is giving too loaded 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.780
 with this card is difficult to give 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.940
 to record a roadside from Mazda 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.500
 arrive uncomfortably in the video that is not 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.050
 but I can do at least two that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.030
 I did cool and nice and I go 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.000
 see how the situation is going to be 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.040
 and Gaia lives guys know the slabs 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.570
 Now you see I said the 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.370
 last video that start to level 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.850
 as soon as you finish these stops is 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.730
 at school and maybe next week 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.980
 maybe because it can be this week with the 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.630
 trade I do not know may be sixth but there 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.670
 Are they going to be Monday to Friday now? 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.770
 so it will not be guaranteed I'll go 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.110
 can be two or three a week 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.180
 is only available and I will post the 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.220
 video on the live talking channel né 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.810
 a link band will be made on the 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.280
 twitter see why twitter it has a 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.470
 likely much better platform than 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.810
 youtube is not going to have that law of 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.980
 50 seconds will be at most 10 to 5 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.740
 seconds of werley 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.650
 the quality is far superior logically 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.990
 the live recordings will be displayed in the 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.090
 I'll save the light channel and I'll 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.080
 send the channel is going to be this way now 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.490
 shop windows

 I 'm organizing everything so you 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.650
 wait to do pb of war cam did 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.390
 lightweight who celebrate b4 of the processor 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.170
 bottleneck I use the process very much to do 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.700
 live 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.460
 So it's going to be this game since I said 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.660
 which will roll the lives right then but was 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.480
 This is what I wanted to talk about in this video. 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.130

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.889
 stop there 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.150
 but that's what I wanted to talk about 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.919
 I hope so quickly that you have 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.620
 the gameplay of the background was well 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.630
 cool I even went very unevenly training 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.120
 It's the new series I hope everything works out.
