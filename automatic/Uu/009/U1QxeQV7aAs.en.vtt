00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
one of our dental journals and we found

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.939 
one of our dental journals and we found
out<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.420> glidewell<00:00:42.020> dental<00:00:42.500> laboratory

object 500s we we had done some homework

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.040 
object 500s we we had done some homework
and<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.120> started<00:00:53.390> reading<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.750> little<00:00:53.870> bit

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
and we started reading a little bit

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.840 
and we started reading a little bit
about<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.350> object<00:00:54.800> printer<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:55.429> were

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
about the object printer so we were

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.430 
about the object printer so we were
familiar<00:00:56.210> with<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:58.239> after<00:00:59.239> taking<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.109> trip<00:01:00.289> up

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
familiar with it after taking a trip up

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.490 
familiar with it after taking a trip up
to<00:01:00.469> Boston<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:02.390> see<00:01:02.660> that<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.079> printer<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.469> the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
to Boston to see that the printer in the

in<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.769> company<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:05.120> decided<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.690> purchase

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
in the company we decided to purchase

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.890 
in the company we decided to purchase
one<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:06.380> December<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.100> 2010<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:10.310> printer<00:01:10.900> came

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
one in December of 2010 the printer came

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.900 
one in December of 2010 the printer came
in<00:01:12.050> here<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.560> basically<00:01:13.130> plugged<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:13.730> and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
in here it basically plugged in and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.150 
in here it basically plugged in and
started<00:01:14.270> working<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.810> was<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.650> a<00:01:15.770> workhorse

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
started working it was it's a workhorse

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.580 
started working it was it's a workhorse
it<00:01:16.760> normally<00:01:17.300> took<00:01:17.570> about<00:01:17.960> five<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.320> seven

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
it normally took about five to seven

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.070 
it normally took about five to seven
days<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.980> produce<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.370> restoration<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.210> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
days to produce a restoration and so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.410 
days to produce a restoration and so
we've<00:01:21.290> we've<00:01:21.890> developed<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.850> a

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
we've we've developed it now to a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.560 
we've we've developed it now to a
digital<00:01:23.780> workflow<00:01:24.230> that<00:01:25.150> we<00:01:26.150> can<00:01:26.330> create

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
digital workflow that we can create

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.460 
digital workflow that we can create
restorations<00:01:27.350> within<00:01:27.800> two<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.550> three<00:01:28.580> days

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
restorations within two to three days

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.690 
restorations within two to three days
we're<00:01:30.470> using<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:31.220> lot<00:01:31.730> of<00:01:31.760> applications<00:01:32.270> we

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
we're using a lot of applications we

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.040 
we're using a lot of applications we
continue<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> do<00:01:34.970> R&amp;D<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.570> create<00:01:35.870> other

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
continue to do R&amp;D and create other

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.160 
continue to do R&amp;D and create other
projects<00:01:36.620> for<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.800> printer<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.960> very

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
projects for a printer and it is very

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.560 
projects for a printer and it is very
accurate<00:01:39.710> as<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.730> can<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.000> here<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.420> have

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
accurate as you can see here we have

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.720 
accurate as you can see here we have
demonstrated<00:01:42.080> here<00:01:42.710> we<00:01:42.950> have<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> fully

demonstrated here we have a fully
articulated<00:01:44.510> quadrant<00:01:45.050> model<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.470> we

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
articulated quadrant model that we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.660 
articulated quadrant model that we
produced<00:01:45.880> along<00:01:46.880> with<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.270> just<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.170> single<00:01:48.670> what

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
produced along with a just a single what

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.300 
produced along with a just a single what
we<00:01:49.790> call<00:01:50.000> p<00:01:50.240> om<00:01:50.480> peace<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.930> mind<00:01:51.200> when<00:01:52.190> we're

doing monolithic restorations we like
the<00:01:54.500> idea<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.860> we<00:01:55.040> can<00:01:55.190> send<00:01:55.430> something<00:01:55.880> back

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
the idea that we can send something back

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.510 
the idea that we can send something back
to<00:01:56.330> verify<00:01:56.840> both<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.740> margins<00:01:58.190> in<00:01:58.310> the

have predictable results my staff enjoys
this<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.460> way<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.610> we've<00:03:12.850> incorporated<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
this the way that we've incorporated the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900 
this the way that we've incorporated the
object<00:03:14.380> printer<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.220> produce<00:03:15.370> models

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
object printer is to produce models

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.170 
object printer is to produce models
mainly<00:03:16.300> based<00:03:16.450> off<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.780> cos<00:03:17.410> scans<00:03:18.180> what

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
mainly based off of cos scans what

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
mainly based off of cos scans what
happens<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.110> will<00:03:20.260> receive<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.740> image

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
happens is we will receive that image

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.920 
happens is we will receive that image
from<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.190> doctor<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:22.000> will<00:03:22.180> take<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.480> into<00:03:22.780> our

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
from the doctor we will take it into our

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.590 
from the doctor we will take it into our
model<00:03:23.320> generation<00:03:23.530> software<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.610> from<00:03:25.480> that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
model generation software and from that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.270 
model generation software and from that
point<00:03:25.660> do<00:03:26.110> what<00:03:26.200> we<00:03:26.290> need<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> define<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
point do what we need to define the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.700 
point do what we need to define the
margin<00:03:27.700> separate<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.360> dye<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:29.290> send<00:03:29.590> it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
margin separate the dye and then send it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.860 
margin separate the dye and then send it
to<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.250> object<00:03:30.760> printer<00:03:31.150> at<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.570> end<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.780> the

day from that point we'll let it run
overnight<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:35.110> will<00:03:35.260> print<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.560> models

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
overnight and it will print the models

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.120 
overnight and it will print the models
necessary<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.210> in<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.690> morning<00:03:37.890> crew<00:03:38.890> comes
