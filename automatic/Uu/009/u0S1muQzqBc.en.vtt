00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.780

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.330
 so I show you a little bit like stakes 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.270
 customize them so 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.480
 first of all you see there is a roster 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.510

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 euros on shotgun on kolster ambidextrous 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 I will put you the price of all that in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 the description so the vest I believe and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.370
 cost not far from 50 euros finally I 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.290
 am not sure I will refer to the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.350
 Port pocket type double door 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.559
 load for type mk of famas that that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.600
 costs 15 euros so small drums 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.960
 so there to catch the chargers more 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.540
 quick 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.400
 the language is con but normally by 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.780
 above you can not go in we see 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
 there you go back just like that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.810
 and then it goes by itself so the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.310
 mark and message also there you you 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 have a gourd so small tips the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.010
 gourd when you do not use it so 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 you wash etc. 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.710
 open there to prevent there being 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 odors a little unpleasant coming out 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.000
 after in vain it's better to leave it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.940
 opened the bottle holder and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 sold with these 4 euros the gourd and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.420
 the bourgeoisie the yard alone 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 his three so that's in a surplus 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 military you see there are several 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 configurations for tips for 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 pressures so we can put up in 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.240
 down according to how tight it is excuse 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.610
 me 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 I put it up there and I pick it up 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.119
 here like that when I hold it it's 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 easier to get out of the gombe whose 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.630
 sheriff can that's the belt that's it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.599
 found in a military surplus at 3 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.140
 euros also it's an army thing 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.280
 is frankly basic go see a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.480
 military surpluses and beautiful 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.800
 things for really cheap there is that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.060
 then there pochât gas masks 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.360
 it may sound weird to use that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 but frankly it's very useful that it 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.250
 cost 3 euros is in read volume 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.980
 extraordinary there you see we can 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.140
 easily put there we can put 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.049
 gas flow 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.200
 all you really want to have 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.730
 all at all a moment when I 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.880
 I will not judge the tactics I had 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 that on my belt in I 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.099
 transported gas tickets will be 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.019
 brought really everything so there you have 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.519
 two side doors so as it is 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.269
 flexible you can easily put a 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.730
 Bottle of teeth here is inside 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:12.930
 put a pocket on top and a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.910
 other inside there on the bottom one 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.470
 see there 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.240
 gaza after the patches I have three so 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:27.870
 a badge of the 1st bm so everything 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.330
 just because I'm in the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.690
 marne and the bnc not far from my home 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.120
 so here is a grade 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.030
 I cut the pages these two euros 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.970
 2 or 3 euros coin always in a 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:49.960
 surplus and finally the door it matters 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.160
 load to load the dea type so 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.960
 which is adjustable in height so there 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.890
 you see the tongue but Velcro 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.580
 water for that you take off you shoot 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.800
 then it grows by itself so it's 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.760
 really practical so that's the 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.480
 mare that brad hand and millet tech that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.310
 costs 8 euros for small drums 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.340
 so for those who do not know the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.430
 small stock market shop it looks 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.960
 soft and paint ball so I believe that 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.190
 it is located only in the marl 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.180
 so that's what it's all about 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.560
 I think it's not bad it looks like it's me 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.900
 look like a good setup I 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.300
 will you say that I should have done 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.220
