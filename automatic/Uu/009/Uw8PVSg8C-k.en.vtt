the beginning and losing it but that you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
the beginning and losing it but that you
really<00:01:55.439> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> focused<00:01:56.040> read<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.549> books

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
really kind of focused read some books

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.999 
really kind of focused read some books
and<00:01:57.119> became<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> winning<00:01:57.869> player<00:01:58.079> um<00:01:58.350> what

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
would you say are some of the biggest

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
would you say are some of the biggest
factors<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.930> contributed<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.770> sort<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
factors that contributed to that sort of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.830 
factors that contributed to that sort of
change<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.630> land<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> profit

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
change into the land of profit

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
change into the land of profit
just<00:02:07.700> really<00:02:08.700> trying<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> learn<00:02:09.390> from

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
just really trying to learn from

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.130 
just really trying to learn from
mistakes<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.590> stuff<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:12.450> weird<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
mistakes and stuff it's weird you you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.870 
mistakes and stuff it's weird you you
make<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> same<00:02:13.590> mistake<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.040> 10<00:02:14.250> times<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
make the same mistake like 10 times and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.339 
make the same mistake like 10 times and
then<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.300> sudden<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.750> clicks<00:02:16.050> and

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
then all of a sudden it clicks and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.309 
then all of a sudden it clicks and
you're<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.890> oh<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.849> bad<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:19.080> sounds

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
you're like oh this is bad and it sounds

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.320 
you're like oh this is bad and it sounds
ridiculous<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.459> takes<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.790> long<00:02:20.849> but

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
ridiculous that it takes that long but

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.270 
ridiculous that it takes that long but
sometimes<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.440> read<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.769> book<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.130> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
sometimes you read in a book that it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
sometimes you read in a book that it's
like<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> good<00:02:23.970> thing<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.480> here's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
like not a good thing to do and here's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960 
like not a good thing to do and here's
the<00:02:24.840> math<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.230> why<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the math of why not to do it and you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.729 
the math of why not to do it and you
figure<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.300> out<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> lot<00:02:27.660> faster<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.140> sometimes

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
figure it out a lot faster and sometimes

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.259 
figure it out a lot faster and sometimes
you<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.370> trial<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.790> error<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.180> were

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
you know it's trial and error we were

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.710 
you know it's trial and error we were
talking<00:02:30.660> recently<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:32.300> like<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.510> makes

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
talking recently about like what makes

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.120 
talking recently about like what makes
Phil<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:33.989> be<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> best<00:02:34.560> player<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> planet

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
Phil I be the best player on the planet

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.050 
Phil I be the best player on the planet
and<00:02:35.580> its<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> not<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.970> there's<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and its really the not that there's a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.430 
and its really the not that there's a
lot<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.239> people<00:02:39.420> who<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.690> better

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
lot of people who have better

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.590 
lot of people who have better
fundamentals<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.430> better<00:02:41.640> math<00:02:41.910> behind<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.480> or

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
fundamentals or better math behind it or

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.050 
fundamentals or better math behind it or
whatever<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.160> all<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.400> those<00:02:44.459> people<00:02:44.700> learn

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
whatever but all of those people learn

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.479 
whatever but all of those people learn
from<00:02:45.299> other<00:02:45.510> people<00:02:45.950> are<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> them

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
from other people are not all of them

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.770 
from other people are not all of them
but<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.670> lot<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.060> them<00:02:48.269> learned<00:02:48.420> from<00:02:48.630> other

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
but a lot of them learned from other

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.839 
but a lot of them learned from other
people<00:02:49.200> they<00:02:49.380> learned<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.920> training<00:02:50.519> sites

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
people they learned from training sites

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.759 
people they learned from training sites
they<00:02:51.360> were<00:02:51.420> given<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> plan<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.319> they<00:02:52.410> go<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
they were given a plan and they go and I

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500 
they were given a plan and they go and I
mean<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.010> was<00:02:53.160> given<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.459> plan<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.299> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
mean I was given a plan and I go in and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.860 
mean I was given a plan and I go in and
I<00:02:54.750> i<00:02:55.110> execute<00:02:55.830> I'm<00:02:55.950> starting<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.510> feel<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.720> own

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
I i execute I'm starting to feel my own

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.270 
I i execute I'm starting to feel my own
plan<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.349> but<00:02:58.560> it'll<00:02:58.739> still<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> long

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
plan out but it'll still be a long

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.030 
plan out but it'll still be a long
journey<00:02:59.959> Ivy<00:03:00.959> never<00:03:01.260> did<00:03:01.500> any<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.799> stuff

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
journey Ivy never did any of that stuff

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.330 
journey Ivy never did any of that stuff
so<00:03:02.690> we've<00:03:03.690> cut<00:03:04.620> me<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.890> couple<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.160> friends

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
so we've cut me in a couple of friends

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
so we've cut me in a couple of friends
are<00:03:05.489> talking<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:05.790> we're<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.330> he's<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
are talking about we're like I he's the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.430 
are talking about we're like I he's the
best<00:03:06.900> because<00:03:08.299> everything<00:03:09.299> he<00:03:09.540> does<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:09.930> why

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
best because everything he does and why

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.410 
best because everything he does and why
he<00:03:10.709> does<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.310> from<00:03:11.609> trial<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.030> error<00:03:12.209> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
he does it is from trial and error and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.250 
he does it is from trial and error and
so<00:03:12.840> his<00:03:13.079> plan<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.650> based<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.100> like<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.989> card<00:03:15.989> data

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so his plan is based on like a card data

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.560 
so his plan is based on like a card data
and<00:03:16.380> stuff<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.519> either<00:03:18.060> be

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
and a flat call and and I'm a small

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.810 
and a flat call and and I'm a small
blind<00:05:18.330> i<00:05:18.480> believe<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:19.410> I've<00:05:19.530> like<00:05:19.680> 32<00:05:20.370> blinds

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820

blind i believe and I've like 32 blinds
or<00:05:21.090> something<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.540> I<00:05:21.630> just<00:05:21.870> elected<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.500> jam

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
or something and I just elected to jam

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.000 
or something and I just elected to jam
um<00:05:23.160> I<00:05:24.030> think<00:05:24.390> all<00:05:24.540> I<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:24.990> every<00:05:25.380> decision<00:05:25.650> is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
um I think all I think every decision is

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.440 
um I think all I think every decision is
like<00:05:26.300> somewhat<00:05:27.300> interesting<00:05:27.900> there<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.380> like

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
like somewhat interesting there and like

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.659 
like somewhat interesting there and like
if<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.810> player<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.080> slightly<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:32.340> if<00:05:32.550> they

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
if the player is slightly like if they

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.280 
if the player is slightly like if they
play<00:05:32.850> slightly<00:05:33.270> different<00:05:33.690> like<00:05:33.870> all<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.230> them

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
play slightly different like all of them

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.740 
play slightly different like all of them
become<00:05:34.710> very<00:05:35.070> different<00:05:36.000> decisions<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.600> like

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
become very different decisions and like

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.540 
become very different decisions and like
some<00:05:37.200> become<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.440> lot<00:05:37.620> better<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:38.010> stuff<00:05:38.250> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
some become a lot better and stuff and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.520 
some become a lot better and stuff and
it's<00:05:39.150> just<00:05:39.330> cool<00:05:39.510> how<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.169> this

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
it's just cool how it's like this this

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.600 
it's just cool how it's like this this
flowing<00:05:41.210> dynamic<00:05:42.210> sort<00:05:42.510> of<00:05:42.630> thing<00:05:42.810> instead<00:05:43.230> of

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
flowing dynamic sort of thing instead of

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.820 
flowing dynamic sort of thing instead of
you<00:05:44.610> know<00:05:44.640> most<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:45.720> cash<00:05:45.960> games<00:05:46.290> online<00:05:46.500> at

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
you know most of cash games online at

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.110 
you know most of cash games online at
least<00:05:46.980> we're<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:47.340> I'm<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.640> hundred<00:05:47.940> blind

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
least we're like I'm a hundred blind

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.230 
least we're like I'm a hundred blind
steep<00:05:48.390> this<00:05:48.630> is<00:05:48.780> what<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.930> do<00:05:49.820> so<00:05:50.820> that's<00:05:51.000> kind

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
steep this is what I do so that's kind

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.909 
steep this is what I do so that's kind
of<00:05:51.270> interesting<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.990> standard<00:05:52.440> decisions

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
of interesting the standard decisions

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.260 
of interesting the standard decisions
and<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.190> will<00:05:53.310> be<00:05:53.430> super<00:05:53.640> interesting<00:05:54.180> of

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
and it will be super interesting of

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.420 
and it will be super interesting of
course<00:05:54.300> in<00:05:54.930> October<00:05:55.470> for<00:05:55.710> us<00:05:55.830> all<00:05:56.100> to<00:05:56.130> be<00:05:56.370> able

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
course in October for us all to be able

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.850 
course in October for us all to be able
to<00:05:56.669> watch<00:05:56.850> you<00:05:57.060> guys<00:05:57.210> in<00:05:57.480> your<00:05:57.810> dynamics<00:05:58.410> with

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
to watch you guys in your dynamics with

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.770 
to watch you guys in your dynamics with
a<00:05:58.890> 15-minute<00:05:59.640> delay<00:05:59.729> on<00:06:00.000> ESP<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:00.600> think

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
a 15-minute delay on ESP and I think

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.230 
a 15-minute delay on ESP and I think
that<00:06:00.930> adds<00:06:01.229> a<00:06:01.470> whole<00:06:01.500> other<00:06:01.860> elements<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.760> you

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
that adds a whole other elements of you

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.500 
that adds a whole other elements of you
know<00:06:03.270> whole<00:06:03.539> other<00:06:03.660> dynamic<00:06:03.930> to

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
know whole other dynamic to

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.090 
know whole other dynamic to
play<00:06:04.690> which<00:06:04.900> will<00:06:05.050> be<00:06:05.170> really<00:06:05.320> cool<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.830> think

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
play which will be really cool I think

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.200 
play which will be really cool I think
that's<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.310> best<00:06:06.520> thing<00:06:06.730> that's<00:06:06.910> happened<00:06:06.970> to

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
that's the best thing that's happened to

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.580 
that's the best thing that's happened to
poker<00:06:07.450> in<00:06:07.660> like<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.900> last<00:06:08.050> three<00:06:08.290> years<00:06:08.320> and
