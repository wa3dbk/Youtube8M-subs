00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.969
 but at first I thought that we would get married and 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.620
 life will be beautiful everything will be only 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.689
 good cloudless 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.200
 but it turned out that there are family 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.200
 the difficulties 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 when we got married after a while 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 u very soon can say after 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.750
 weddings we decided that we want to have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 children and we started planning but long 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 time we did not succeed depends 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.650
 I have a child with different 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 health problems I've been treated a lot 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.970
 and when it seemed that the time was right 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 it has arrived and everything should be fine to me 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.970
 diagnosed very serious 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.159
 diseases and it seemed like a chance at all 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.159
 no longer have children 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
 once my listened to a speech 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.240
 head 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.110
 church and he said such a thing that if 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 we want something very much we can 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.210
 especially ask it from the gentlemen promising 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 him something in return and we thought it was 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.690
 good idea for us and we chose one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 thing we decided to do each 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.119
 day is to study the scriptures and we 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 studied every day for a year and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:02:00.479
 exactly one year later i got pregnant 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:02.820
 Masha was born I always continued to believe 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.429
 the fact that the Lord will help us and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 so that we have children and so and 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:13.560
 happened we are very thankful to god for 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.590
 that he blessed us with our little ones 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.080
 kid every time i look at 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.420
 our car just i think some 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.030
 a great miracle which god gives us 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.110
 little babies i'm very strong 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.720
 thank him for giving us our test 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.930
 helped to become much happier on 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.849
 actually because now we appreciate 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.819
 every moment we can spend 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.340
 together I became much happier in marriage 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 now than at that moment when you 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.530
 I got married very much now 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 men though then it seemed that 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 the strongest wife where 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.510
 during the test and most importantly not 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.239
 despair continue to believe continue 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.209
 just enjoy life do what 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.880
 you make and pepper that it will pass and all 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.989
 it will be much better to look for the most 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.370
 positive aspects in your life and 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.940
 turn a blind eye to the negative that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.940
 there is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 of course this love is less forgiven 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.480
 donation 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.840
 this is heavy support 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.840
 moments 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.030
 think no more about yourself about seagulls with 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.100
 who do you live with who do you want 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.100
 live all this life I hope
