sound<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.610> often<00:02:06.329> sound<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:07.049> tell<00:02:07.229> our

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
sound and often sound can tell our

sound and often sound can tell our
stories<00:02:07.770> better<00:02:08.009> than<00:02:08.280> video<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:09.239> video<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
stories better than video when video is

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.110 
stories better than video when video is
ugly<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.890> audio<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.340> good

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
ugly but the audio is good

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
ugly but the audio is good
it's<00:02:12.360> watchable<00:02:12.900> whereas<00:02:13.680> nice<00:02:14.010> looking

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
video and bad audio that is a

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.430 
video and bad audio that is a
deal-breaker<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.659> camera<00:02:19.110> lenses

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
deal-breaker so just like camera lenses

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.020 
deal-breaker so just like camera lenses
there's<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.830> different<00:02:20.159> mic<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.790> every<00:02:21.000> job

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
there's a different mic for every job

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.360 
there's a different mic for every job
today<00:02:21.959> i'll<00:02:22.170> talk<00:02:22.319> about<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.650> microphones<00:02:23.129> i

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
today i'll talk about the microphones i

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.089 
today i'll talk about the microphones i
use<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.940> why<00:02:24.200> first<00:02:25.200> up<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.709> primary

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
use and why first up is my primary

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.750 
use and why first up is my primary

microphones<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.780> capture<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.409> best

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
microphones like this capture the best

audio when pointed directly at the audio
source<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.890> you'll<00:02:35.010> notice<00:02:35.310> when<00:02:35.400> i<00:02:35.459> start<00:02:35.819> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
source but you'll notice when i start to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930 
source but you'll notice when i start to
turn<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.299> mic<00:02:36.510> away<00:02:36.659> i<00:02:37.290> start<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.769> lose<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
turn the mic away i start to lose the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
turn the mic away i start to lose the
audio<00:02:39.329> that's<00:02:39.959> because<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.500> recording

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
audio that's because the recording

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.619 
audio that's because the recording

an ideal type of microphone for most
video<00:03:00.450> applications<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.379> use<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.099> for<00:03:02.129> voice

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
video applications I use it for voice

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550 
video applications I use it for voice
over<00:03:02.670> interviews<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> boom<00:03:04.260> pole

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
over interviews and on a boom pole

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920 
over interviews and on a boom pole
because<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.640> captures<00:03:05.819> voices<00:03:06.480> without<00:03:06.750> too

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
because it captures voices without too

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
much background sound I also have this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.599

sennheiser<00:03:09.690> dynamic<00:03:10.319> mic<00:03:10.560> mike's<00:03:11.129> like<00:03:11.430> this

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
sennheiser dynamic mic mike's like this

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.490 
sennheiser dynamic mic mike's like this
are<00:03:11.790> often<00:03:12.060> called<00:03:12.269> vocal<00:03:12.720> mics<00:03:12.959> because<00:03:13.349> they

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
are often called vocal mics because they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.199 
are often called vocal mics because they
pick<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.920> human<00:03:14.220> voice<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.730> well<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
pick up the human voice pretty well and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.780 
pick up the human voice pretty well and
I<00:03:15.690> call<00:03:15.900> them<00:03:16.019> stick<00:03:16.410> mics<00:03:16.680> maybe<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.519> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
I call them stick mics maybe because you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.520 
I call them stick mics maybe because you
can<00:03:17.940> stick<00:03:18.450> them<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.750> other<00:03:18.930> people's<00:03:19.230> faces

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
can stick them in other people's faces

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.129 
can stick them in other people's faces
unlike<00:03:20.459> my<00:03:20.669> shotgun<00:03:21.090> mic<00:03:21.299> which<00:03:21.569> requires<00:03:22.019> a

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
unlike my shotgun mic which requires a

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.680 
unlike my shotgun mic which requires a
triple<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.590> battery<00:03:22.950> dynamic<00:03:23.849> mics<00:03:24.090> don't<00:03:24.389> need

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
triple a battery dynamic mics don't need

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.080 
triple a battery dynamic mics don't need
power<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.560> makes<00:03:25.829> them<00:03:25.980> cheaper<00:03:26.459> stronger

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
power this makes them cheaper stronger

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.390 
power this makes them cheaper stronger
but<00:03:27.389> less<00:03:27.690> sensitive<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.680> they<00:03:28.980> work<00:03:29.160> better

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
but less sensitive so they work better

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.909 
but less sensitive so they work better
when<00:03:29.609> close<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> subject<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:31.260> also<00:03:31.560> has<00:03:31.889> a

like<00:05:04.720> most<00:05:04.960> DSLRs<00:05:05.650> my<00:05:05.889> camera<00:05:06.250> doesn't

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
like most DSLRs my camera doesn't

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.939 
like most DSLRs my camera doesn't
provide<00:05:06.849> great<00:05:07.210> audio<00:05:07.630> controls<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.409> I<00:05:08.440> record

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
provide great audio controls so I record

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.040 
provide great audio controls so I record
my<00:05:09.099> audio<00:05:09.310> on<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.729> portable<00:05:10.120> audio<00:05:10.539> recorder

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
my audio on a portable audio recorder

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.129 
my audio on a portable audio recorder
called<00:05:11.319> the<00:05:11.470> zoom<00:05:11.710> h4n<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.940> has<00:05:13.479> XLR<00:05:14.080> and

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
called the zoom h4n it has XLR and

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.140 
called the zoom h4n it has XLR and
quarter-inch<00:05:14.830> inputs<00:05:15.340> for<00:05:15.520> my<00:05:15.639> microphones

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
quarter-inch inputs for my microphones

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.120 
quarter-inch inputs for my microphones
but<00:05:16.810> it's<00:05:16.930> great<00:05:17.199> for<00:05:17.440> event<00:05:17.830> videography

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
but it's great for event videography

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.309 
but it's great for event videography
because<00:05:18.789> I<00:05:18.819> can<00:05:19.000> record<00:05:19.240> two<00:05:19.599> inputs<00:05:20.080> at<00:05:20.229> the

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
because I can record two inputs at the

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.040 
because I can record two inputs at the
same<00:05:20.530> time<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.099> use<00:05:21.819> these<00:05:22.120> on<00:05:22.330> board<00:05:22.599> stereo

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
same time and use these on board stereo

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.140 
same time and use these on board stereo
mics<00:05:23.319> which<00:05:23.680> you're<00:05:24.310> hearing<00:05:25.150> right<00:05:25.180> now

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
mics which you're hearing right now

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.670 
mics which you're hearing right now
these<00:05:28.150> are<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.419> mics<00:05:28.629> that<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.870> happen<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.380> use

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
these are the mics that I happen to use

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.170 
these are the mics that I happen to use
but<00:05:29.979> it's<00:05:30.099> important<00:05:30.520> for<00:05:30.639> you<00:05:30.759> to<00:05:30.789> consider

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
but it's important for you to consider

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.689 
but it's important for you to consider
how<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.539> capture<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.110> best<00:05:32.319> audio<00:05:32.710> using<00:05:33.280> your

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
how to capture the best audio using your

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.760 
how to capture the best audio using your
equipment<00:05:34.180> usually<00:05:34.599> this<00:05:35.020> means<00:05:35.229> getting<00:05:35.620> a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
equipment usually this means getting a

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.070 
equipment usually this means getting a
microphone<00:05:35.919> close<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.909> the<00:05:37.000> action<00:05:37.419> so<00:05:37.840> al
