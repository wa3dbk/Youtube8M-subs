00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.360
 very good guys let's make the video 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.190
 from today good a village design of 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.660
 Town hall level 8 and well I'll leave 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.869
 some seconds so that all 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.300
 you pause in the video and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.700
 good you can then make the wall 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.960
 quietly and without needing to be 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.119
 stopping and starting stopping and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.219
 booting in the video here you have a few 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.140
 seconds is once you have all the 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.570
 It will be super easy because 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
 organize and make the village good let's 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.260
 start then with the castle that the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.540
 clan castle you have to always 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.699
 yes or yes in the center and I prefer to put 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.050
 the town hall aside for me is more 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.460
 important to have a good castle of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.070
 clan and have magician level 5 at least or 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.390
 Some witches would come much better than 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.819
 be more focused to make it more 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.730
 difficult to remove the castle and therefore 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.280
 cost more to get to the center good and 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 we have the central area because we already have 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.569
 here then the warehouse of the dark isr to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.040
 barbara king and an air defense now 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.320
 We are putting up a magician tower 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 together with a mortar and well let's 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.380
 putting a store is also because it is a 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.020
 cup rise design not of war 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 the fundamental difference above all is 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.650
 the warehouses and well let's place 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.350
 some others 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.659
 one of the and here we can put a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 portion near some other dog we go 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.770
 to find on this side a tower of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.200
 fabric that comes pretty well in one place 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 that there seems to be no tower 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760
 and well we are putting another trap of 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 skeletons here and in case you 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.380
 come by land put them in mode 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.140
 land and another warehouse so close to the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.330
 pink vizir store we are not going to paste 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.100
 so it is not going to put all of the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.160
 isr together but one of what did one 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.690
 from one decide now if not the best for 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.070
 example if I need to say then if not 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.530
 you have on the one hand, treated by that 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.149
 side but we're going to distribute it not and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.500
 good but here a jump trap 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.690
 in case they destroy then with 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.759
 giant or any story that cannon 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 they are going to go for the tower 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.570
 archers that we are going to put here then 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.910
 they fly through the air, good, we have 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 a few compartments of them and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.000
 then it is then put the mortar 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.759
 over here we are going to put another warehouse of 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 gold here and good stores 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.269
 distribute it as you want but 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.040
 I like this distribution, I'm going to 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.360
 place in this way the warehouses that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.799
 they have to be exposed but not so 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.660
 exposed a magician tower in case of 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.020
 come and rob us with archers and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.330
 the rest 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 because with the tower of magician the stings 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.290
 it has was we eliminated it here we have 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.230
 another cannon and we will put here then 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.260
 surely a mortar that is going to be more 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.940
 what are we going to put in case they want 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.160
 take out the castle the clan out there and a 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.440
 giant small bulb a jumping trampita 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.440
 perhaps in Europe the wall and in three 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.360
 giant you can be eliminated a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.580
 anti-aircraft defense rocket is known from 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.030
 all life and good we go good here 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.980
 a tesla tower and nothing we will continue 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.730
 to follow and that we can put for some 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.500
 that another little bomb around here the little bomb 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.120
 many years ago but mostly to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.130
 units like barbarella esquerra or something 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.350
 can you ask can we say let's 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.000
 put here then a tower of archers 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.250
 with a warehouse lizzie rosso has to go 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 everything and nothing is super easy design 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.540
 of the village when we already have all 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.670
 the walls you can say a little bomb 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.030
 yours here in right next to 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.790
 the defense west defense air like 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.190
 it's called now nothing a cannon cited 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.410
 because the right part a tower of magician 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.230
 that is going to be the most exposed of all and 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.459
 well we would put another store around here 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.080
 I would put 1 gold 21 to say me in my 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.819
 case you can put 1 say because I 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.069
 More than gold I prefer gold 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.680
 keep it more on the rise we put 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.120
 here some block of the pitas and nothing 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.769
 We will continue to do the design and 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.690
 we practically have the whole village to 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.879
 We are going to see what we can put 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.410
 the last mortar we would have the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.819
 mortar square a tower of 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.950
 archers that will be the most 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.500
 tickets you since it has good radio 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.500
 of reach and we put another one to the good side 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.360
 that we can put here a rocket of 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.150
 defense and we have them all put a 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.540
 giant small bulb on this side and a cannon 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.060
 here 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.849
 let's continue and we put here another 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.920
 gold store that good for example in 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.359
 the war village because you can take out 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 the stores were instead in their 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.239
 life of glasses I do not go to drinks you have to 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.579
 need the to be able to get 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.560
 get gold to attack and elixir 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.240
 to be able to make the troops then more 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.919
 or less we already have the village is already the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.389
 true that it was pretty cool and 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.740
 well here the only change that if 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.880
 you want to be able to do is the castle what 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.650
 that go by the town hall but I 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.210
 I prefer to put it like that because if we 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.250
 we fill the clan castle is a weapon 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.870
 super powerful a weapon that will help 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.759
 very much and many players top 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.949
 prefer to put it in the center since it is 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.139
 harder to get it out than to put it out 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.419
 more exposed you can say no outside 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.680
 not because if for example if 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.410
 we go in punishment the clan for the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.210
 City Hall but if you have a magician 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.740
 some archer of some dragon some 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.780
 Witches in the center is going to help you 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.120
 very much more need a side because 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.669
 by putting what to do to create a side is 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.960
 as saying attack on that side 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.070
 make the troops and a tremendous desire 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.470
 Over there 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.180
 and surely then blanc we will do a side 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.980
 that is, let's see that side and 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.930
 where all the bombs will be and some 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.640
 they will go there all the pumps are not 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.960
 then let's do for the work that is 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.670
 more discovered then you get before 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.130
 councils as they decompensate 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.770
 take out the castle the field one side what 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.180
 what are we doing now? 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.970
 the usual thing to put buildings less 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.740
 important that's why I have not commented 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.690
 Much can be said and what needs to be 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.010
 to do is that for example we 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.540
 we go on vacation you put us a 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.070
 abstract of liz and other golden one of 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.870
 lis and another one of what we are not going to put then 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.800
 all on one side is to say on the 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.600
 example the top part to the 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.980
 left we can all gold the mines 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.510
 Live and gradually the bottom 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.980
 how we put all crisis extractors 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.320
 do not make it a bit difficult 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.700
 it costs to steal for example me now 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.350
 same I'm practically jon that is 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.760
 no, I would not be as bad as a parrot 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.730
 so if you propose a side for heel 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.810
 closed and I'm leaving, well, that's not 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.430
 be very careful and at least 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.320
 how hard people think that happened 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.000
 this is a strategy game shapes 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.370
 here a drill to say we put a 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.690
 barracks and nothing and now this part then 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.010
 we have practically one of them 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.450
 the big spaces I'm going to put the 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.920
 camps and the penalty that now the 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.600
 camps have almost no life 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.320
 before and it was a good defense you can 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.870
 tell 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.090
 pantry I mean a good building 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.010
 those who have a lot of life is no longer like 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.510
 you can say before we paste 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.430
 probably around here we will put the 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.710
 last camp effectively what 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.950
 we put here and good since I change 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.930
 we are going to put more then let's put it 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.760
 here in bat perfect for mac and a 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.460
 barracks that we have not put 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.710
 practically none and well I will not stay 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.020
 right now a barracks and a few 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.210
 elixir extractors and look we put 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.520
 to the extractor to say a 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.860
 piercer the dark vizier and good then 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.230
 would be missing a little bit of what is left 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.840
 this is already like everyone you put 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.760
 how you want this is important but 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.580
 is not as important as the design in 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.260
 sidereal of act what will stamp 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.470
 can you say to make it difficult in the 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.730
 entry of enemy troops was the village 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.960
 it works very well if you have to 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.000
 clancy shipyard you do not have to do 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.920
 Clan can work well you do not see 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.930
 so no but with castle that 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.490
 we work very well from this village 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.450
 this design for you to defend with 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.550
 punishments things if you're not going to defend 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.710
 change the town hall with the castle 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.720
 re good as she repeated what 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.240
 it remains then now it is usually put was the 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.849
 chocillas around here pretty much 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.110
 It is worth here, the seat protects the mortar 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.660
 more or less also protects it in case 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.550
 so come, for example, barbarians who 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.050
 They attack a melee that can 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.090
 but attack from a distance like the archery 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.669
 And here is as good archer tower 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.229
 well discover this area quite well what 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.509
 what's left now are not all 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.520
 procedures of jumps of vigo and where the 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.470
 we would put a good one trampita of 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.270
 we'll jump it here 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.639
 of breaking walls and going to enter 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.960
 for example breaking the wall any 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.990
 history then for that part and the other 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.630
 we put it here I am 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.759
 thinking and good if we're going to save the 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.889
 we activate it and we have 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:54.630
 our village design the truth that 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.580
 it was pretty cool I hope you tell me 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.110
 in comments and has served if you like 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.560
 the design that what they would change what is 

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:03.599
 what would they do well in their place that 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.770
 would change or that so nothing this has 

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.090
 been the video today I hope that has 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.800
 liked do not forget about the aic subscribe 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.800
 in the next goodbye
