 it is with god 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.759
 yes, many employees fear for those who have a pure heart 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.409
 the subscript he was about to fall 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.740
 because I saw the happiness of men and gods and I was jealous of these people 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.509
 see me 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.129
 until death he does not suffer so you have to ride in good health they 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.780
 do not have the same worries as everyone else's misfortune that strikes others 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340
 go away from there 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.350
 that's why they are swollen to collect and violence the envelopes 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.740
 like a garment 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.970
 eyes shine 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.450
 in the middle of their claws 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 all those who imagine them in their hearts exceed the measure 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.520
 it's called people their words are hard and is not taken into account 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.090

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 that's why the people are turning to them 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.450
 they show their words like water 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.900
 these people do not say 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.850
 google knows nothing who is there at risk the icann is something 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.920
 here are the people moser me 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.810
 they increase their wealth quite quietly 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.810
 it's really for nothing that I kept my pure heart 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 that I realized my hands to show my innocence 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.290
 every day they hit me every morning we do not punish 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.460
 I could talk like bad people 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.410
 but then odile 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.690
 I would betray children 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.140
 so I thought about it and saw it was difficult 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.160
 but when I entered your time 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.280
 I understood 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.530
 what are these people waiting for? 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.520
 you read but on slippery roads for which disappear more quickly 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 suddenly they are finished 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.070
 destroyed by fear 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.440
 when I was deeply torn I was stupid I did not understand anything 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 I was like a beast in front of you 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.599

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.529
