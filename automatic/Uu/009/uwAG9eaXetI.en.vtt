rising trot when you're ready and then
we'll<00:00:43.760> discuss<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.360> diagonals<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:47.140> then

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
we'll discuss the diagonals and then

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.460 
we'll discuss the diagonals and then
show<00:00:48.380> how<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:48.620> change<00:00:48.980> them<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:53.600> rise<00:00:53.990> in

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
show how to change them so in rise in

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.470 
show how to change them so in rise in
trot<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:55.250> horse<00:00:55.850> works<00:00:56.240> in<00:00:56.630> diagonal<00:00:57.020> pairs<00:00:58.480> so

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
trot a horse works in diagonal pairs so

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.530 
trot a horse works in diagonal pairs so
you<00:00:59.540> can<00:00:59.810> see<00:01:00.050> how<00:01:00.350> his<00:01:01.160> left<00:01:01.580> four<00:01:02.030> that's

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
you can see how his left four that's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.929 
you can see how his left four that's
orange<00:01:02.990> comes<00:01:03.650> down<00:01:03.860> at<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.009> same<00:01:04.220> time<00:01:04.640> as

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
orange comes down at the same time as

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.139 
orange comes down at the same time as
the<00:01:05.239> right<00:01:05.479> hind<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.200> orange<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.149> likewise

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.849 
the left hind in green comes down at the
same<00:01:11.600> time<00:01:11.899> as<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.859> right<00:01:13.640> four<00:01:14.119> leg<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:15.619> she's

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
same time as the right four leg so she's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.980 
same time as the right four leg so she's
riding<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.460> correct<00:01:16.759> diagonal<00:01:17.390> because

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
riding on the correct diagonal because

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.709 
riding on the correct diagonal because
as<00:01:18.259> she<00:01:18.289> sits<00:01:18.829> she's<00:01:19.789> sitting<00:01:20.060> on<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.299> orange

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.200 
as she sits she's sitting on the orange
diagonal<00:01:21.530> pair<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.310> legs<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:22.850> she<00:01:22.880> should<00:01:23.179> be

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
diagonal pair of legs so she should be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.669 
diagonal pair of legs so she should be
sitting<00:01:23.659> as<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.520> left<00:01:25.520> four<00:01:25.969> leg<00:01:26.380> comes<00:01:27.380> down

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
sitting as the left four leg comes down

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.950 
sitting as the left four leg comes down
to<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.039> ground<00:01:30.819> so<00:01:31.819> Emma<00:01:32.060> if<00:01:32.359> you<00:01:32.509> could<00:01:32.719> show

to the ground so Emma if you could show

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.319 
to the ground so Emma if you could show
us<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> change<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.889> rain<00:01:34.159> perhaps<00:01:34.789> from<00:01:35.030> M

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
us a change of rain perhaps from M

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.499 
us a change of rain perhaps from M
across<00:01:35.749> the<00:01:35.929> diagonal<00:01:36.579> with<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.880> show<00:01:38.240> us<00:01:38.359> how

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
across the diagonal with and show us how

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.289 
across the diagonal with and show us how
you<00:01:38.539> change<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.200> diagonal<00:01:39.649> this<00:01:40.579> she'll<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.090> by

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
you change a diagonal this she'll do by

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.109 
you change a diagonal this she'll do by
sitting<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.990> two<00:01:42.170> beats<00:01:42.490> it's<00:01:43.490> important

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
sitting for two beats it's important

calm in his trot pace oh he doesn't slow

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.029 
calm in his trot pace oh he doesn't slow
down<00:01:55.130> or<00:01:55.759> speed<00:01:55.969> up<00:01:56.530> doesn't<00:01:57.530> throw<00:01:57.740> his<00:01:57.859> head

light seat Tony didn't change rhythm at
all<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.800> look<00:02:33.790> very<00:02:34.000> calm<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.540> relaxed<00:02:35.110> now

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
all and look very calm and relaxed now

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.040 
all and look very calm and relaxed now
if<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.340> were<00:02:36.460> wanting<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> ride<00:02:37.270> some<00:02:37.810> length

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
if you were wanting to ride some length

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.560 
if you were wanting to ride some length
and<00:02:38.290> strides<00:02:38.680> or<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> medium<00:02:39.700> trot<00:02:40.030> across<00:02:40.210> the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
and strides or a medium trot across the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.020 
and strides or a medium trot across the
diagonal<00:02:41.100> another<00:02:42.100> way<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.490> changing<00:02:42.970> your

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
diagonal another way of changing your

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.990 
diagonal another way of changing your
diagonal<00:02:43.480> would<00:02:44.170> be<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.620> maintain<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.520> trot

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
diagonal would be to maintain the trot

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360 
diagonal would be to maintain the trot
rhythm<00:02:46.660> all<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.230> way<00:02:47.350> across<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.010> diagonal

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
rhythm all the way across the diagonal

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.130 
rhythm all the way across the diagonal
and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.710> change<00:02:51.100> as<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:52.360> reach<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.930> end

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
and then to change as you reach the end

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.990 
and then to change as you reach the end
of<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.530> diagonal<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.340> Emma's<00:02:54.580> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.790> sell

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
of the diagonal so Emma's going to sell

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.670 
of the diagonal so Emma's going to sell
us<00:02:55.030> this<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.780> there<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.200> go<00:03:02.410> she's<00:03:02.650> just

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
us this so there you go she's just

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.770 
us this so there you go she's just
changed<00:03:03.100> again<00:03:03.520> towards<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.330> end<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
changed again towards the end of the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.910 
changed again towards the end of the
diagonal<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:07.140> then<00:03:08.140> we'll<00:03:08.290> do<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.530> once<00:03:08.740> more

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
diagonal and then we'll do it once more

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.190 
diagonal and then we'll do it once more
back<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.460> other<00:03:09.610> way

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
back the other way

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.170 
back the other way
so<00:03:11.200> obviously<00:03:11.530> she's<00:03:11.800> maintaining<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.640> working

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so obviously she's maintaining a working

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.410 
so obviously she's maintaining a working
truck<00:03:13.450> just<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.020> show<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.400> exercise<00:03:18.420> but

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
truck just to show you this exercise but

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.330 
truck just to show you this exercise but
it's<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.720> way<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.080> being<00:03:20.290> able<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.650> maintain<00:03:21.010> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's a way of being able to maintain a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
it's a way of being able to maintain a
rhythm<00:03:21.880> if<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.330> sensitive<00:03:22.900> horse<00:03:24.360> so

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
rhythm if you have a sensitive horse so

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.180 
rhythm if you have a sensitive horse so
that<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.630> don't<00:03:25.840> disrupt<00:03:26.290> anything<00:03:26.650> as<00:03:27.040> you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
that you don't disrupt anything as you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.180 
that you don't disrupt anything as you
go<00:03:27.340> across<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.850> center<00:03:28.710> so<00:03:29.710> again<00:03:29.920> as<00:03:30.070> she

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
go across the center so again as she

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.070 
go across the center so again as she
approaches<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.880> turn<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.480> she'll<00:03:31.810> change

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
approaches the turn here she'll change

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.060 
approaches the turn here she'll change
about<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:35.370> onto<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.490> correct<00:03:36.730> diagonal

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
about now and onto the correct diagonal

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.350 
about now and onto the correct diagonal
thank<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.370> if<00:03:39.490> you'd<00:03:39.640> like<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:40.060> go

forward<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.960> walk<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:44.350> recap<00:03:45.100> over<00:03:45.520> what<00:03:45.670> we've

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
forward to walk to recap over what we've

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.600 
forward to walk to recap over what we've
done<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.240> morning<00:03:46.710> changing<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:48.010> diagonal

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
done this morning changing the diagonal

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.290 
done this morning changing the diagonal
at<00:03:48.730> rising<00:03:48.970> trot<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.750> important<00:03:50.410> because<00:03:51.370> you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
at rising trot is important because you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.030 
at rising trot is important because you
should<00:03:52.540> ride<00:03:52.780> on<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.140> correct<00:03:53.470> diagonal

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
should ride on the correct diagonal

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920 
should ride on the correct diagonal
according<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.640> rain<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.150> you're<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.570> in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
according to the rain that you're on in

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.100 
according to the rain that you're on in
an<00:03:56.080> arena<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:56.890> should<00:03:57.700> also<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.720> and

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
an arena and you should also do that and

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.770 
an arena and you should also do that and
change<00:03:59.530> your<00:03:59.740> diagonal<00:04:00.340> when<00:04:00.520> out<00:04:00.670> hacking<00:04:01.210> so

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
change your diagonal when out hacking so

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.580 
change your diagonal when out hacking so
the<00:04:01.900> horse<00:04:02.280> strengthens<00:04:03.280> up<00:04:03.490> equally<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.390> both

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
the horse strengthens up equally on both

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.150 
the horse strengthens up equally on both
diagonals<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.120> rider<00:04:07.360> should<00:04:07.660> sit<00:04:08.020> as<00:04:08.350> the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
diagonals so the rider should sit as the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.250 
diagonals so the rider should sit as the
outside<00:04:09.670> four<00:04:10.000> leg<00:04:10.240> comes<00:04:10.510> down<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
outside four leg comes down to the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.670 
outside four leg comes down to the
ground<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.790> matches<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.750> inside<00:04:13.990> hind

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
ground and that matches the inside hind

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.620 
ground and that matches the inside hind
leg<00:04:14.920> coming<00:04:15.190> forward<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:15.940> down<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.510> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
leg coming forward and down to the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.670 
leg coming forward and down to the
ground<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:19.000> change<00:04:19.270> your<00:04:19.420> diagonal<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
ground and to change your diagonal the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.150 
ground and to change your diagonal the
rider<00:04:20.950> take<00:04:21.730> sits<00:04:22.330> for<00:04:22.570> two<00:04:22.780> beats<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.800> light

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
rider take sits for two beats but light

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.610 
rider take sits for two beats but light
in<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.580> seat<00:04:24.850> so<00:04:25.180> she<00:04:25.600> doesn't<00:04:25.900> disturb<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
in the seat so she doesn't disturb the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.460 
in the seat so she doesn't disturb the
rhythm<00:04:26.980> of<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.250> horse<00:04:27.520> or<00:04:28.260> make<00:04:29.260> any

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
rhythm of the horse or make any

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.350 
rhythm of the horse or make any
adjustments<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.400> her<00:04:30.520> position<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.300> she

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
adjustments to her position so she

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.710 
adjustments to her position so she
maintains<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.080> soft<00:04:32.380> balance<00:04:33.340> position

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
maintains a soft balance position

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.850 
maintains a soft balance position
allowing<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.900> horse<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.380> move<00:04:35.590> freely

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
allowing the horse to move freely

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.490 
allowing the horse to move freely
forward
