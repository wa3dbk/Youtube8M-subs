power<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.579> 120<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.329> armor<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.910> 644<00:00:35.910> let's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
power is 120 or armor is 644 let's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.819 
power is 120 or armor is 644 let's
activate<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> armor<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
activate the armor and let's see if it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.459 
activate the armor and let's see if it
changes<00:00:38.570> yep<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.809> changes<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:41.300> 1600m<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.510> 1062

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
changes yep this changes to 1600m a 1062

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.850 
changes yep this changes to 1600m a 1062
and<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.640> changes<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> hundred<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> does

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and this changes to a hundred so it does

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
and this changes to a hundred so it does
what<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> says<00:00:47.690> awesome<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.200> don't<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.500> me

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
resistances by forty percent while

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.570 
resistances by forty percent while
energy<00:02:37.000> armor<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.390> active<00:02:38.310> let's<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.459> look

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
energy armor is active let's take a look

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460 
energy armor is active let's take a look
at<00:02:39.640> resistances<00:02:40.360> shall<00:02:40.600> we<00:02:40.720> are<00:02:40.870> resistances

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
at resistances shall we are resistances

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.580 
at resistances shall we are resistances
are<00:02:41.890> 48<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.940> 60<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:43.690> one<00:02:43.810> okay<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.230> all<00:02:44.350> of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
are 48 and 60 for one okay so all of

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
are 48 and 60 for one okay so all of
those<00:02:44.709> 48<00:02:45.100> let's<00:02:45.430> keep<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> now<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.410> all<00:02:47.920> 67

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
those 48 let's keep it now it's all 67

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.330 
those 48 let's keep it now it's all 67
awesome<00:02:50.010> holy<00:02:51.010> crap<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.440> energy<00:02:54.130> armor

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
awesome holy crap that is energy armor

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.130 
awesome holy crap that is energy armor
in<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:55.209> nutshell<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.480> basically<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
in a nutshell it is just basically the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.350 
in a nutshell it is just basically the
armor<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.739> use<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.790> increase<00:03:00.970> your<00:03:01.209> defense<00:03:01.900> by

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
armor to use to increase your defense by

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.720 
armor to use to increase your defense by
sixty-five<00:03:04.360> percent<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.549> ridiculous

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
sixty-five percent that is ridiculous

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.710 
sixty-five percent that is ridiculous
and<00:03:07.650> me<00:03:08.650> personally<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:09.370> recommend<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.570> you

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and me personally I recommend that you

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.890 
and me personally I recommend that you
use<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:11.170> um<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:12.700> you're<00:03:12.940> going<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.180> dps<00:03:13.660> route

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
use this um if you're going to dps route

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.940 
use this um if you're going to dps route
because<00:03:14.140> you're<00:03:14.230> gonna<00:03:14.320> have<00:03:14.530> very<00:03:14.739> low

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
because you're gonna have very low

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.310 
because you're gonna have very low
defense<00:03:15.340> unless<00:03:15.700> you're<00:03:16.660> really<00:03:16.840> lucky<00:03:17.140> and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
defense unless you're really lucky and
