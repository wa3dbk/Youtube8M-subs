00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
away from the surface because of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
away from the surface because of the
pressure<00:01:26.280> that's<00:01:26.520> being<00:01:26.729> created<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.720> the

pressure that's being created by the
fold<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> bend<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> leather<00:01:29.189> and

waterproof membrane that's on the other
side<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.560> out<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.030> you're<00:03:25.209> creating<00:03:25.570> a

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
side and out so that you're creating a

basically we're trying to keep that as a
moisture<00:03:32.140> management<00:03:32.350> system<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.160> that's

moisture management system and that's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.490 
moisture management system and that's
our<00:03:33.640> what<00:03:34.120> we<00:03:34.269> use<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:34.930> our<00:03:35.079> moisture

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
our what we use as our moisture

having that extra insulation in there

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.510 
having that extra insulation in there
because<00:05:09.870> as<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.229> compress<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.830> insulation

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
because as you compress the insulation

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.880 
because as you compress the insulation
over<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.850> toe<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.539> heel<00:05:12.890> you're

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
over the toe and in the heel you're

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.680 
over the toe and in the heel you're
squeezing<00:05:14.190> that<00:05:14.460> insulation<00:05:14.910> down<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.539> it's

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
squeezing that insulation down so it's

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.600 
squeezing that insulation down so it's
losing<00:05:16.020> its<00:05:16.260> insulating<00:05:16.830> characteristics

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
losing its insulating characteristics

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.210

with<00:05:18.210> 400<00:05:18.750> grams<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.260> not<00:05:19.440> too<00:05:19.650> thick<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:19.950> it

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
with 400 grams it's not too thick and it

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.710 
with 400 grams it's not too thick and it
doesn't<00:05:20.520> get<00:05:20.640> compressed<00:05:20.940> down<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:21.539> much

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
doesn't get compressed down so much

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.050 
doesn't get compressed down so much
that's<00:05:22.289> why<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.070> optimum<00:05:23.550> insulation

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
that's why it is the optimum insulation
