00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
process and this this is a very

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.110 
process and this this is a very
important<00:00:35.829> thing<00:00:36.070> because<00:00:36.280> we<00:00:36.520> have<00:00:36.670> so<00:00:36.940> many

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
important thing because we have so many

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.760 
important thing because we have so many
patients<00:00:37.480> who<00:00:37.870> are<00:00:37.960> destroying<00:00:38.559> the

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.079 
patients in a very small amount of time
and<00:00:55.329> because<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:56.229> is<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.620> case<00:00:56.890> then<00:00:57.339> we<00:00:57.850> can

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
and because that is the case then we can

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.360 
and because that is the case then we can
provide<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.600> services<00:00:59.140> at<00:00:59.319> a<00:00:59.350> lower<00:00:59.679> cost<00:00:59.800> I

and<00:01:58.750> k9<00:01:59.080> guidance<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.160> now<00:02:00.520> we're<00:02:00.730> going<00:02:00.880> to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
and k9 guidance so now we're going to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.870 
and k9 guidance so now we're going to
use<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> mouth<00:02:02.220> now<00:02:03.220> we're<00:02:03.490> trying

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
use that in the mouth now we're trying

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.790 
use that in the mouth now we're trying
the<00:02:04.120> silicon<00:02:04.630> matrix<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.320> mouth<00:02:05.530> making

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.490 
teeth almost a millimeter and a half now
what<00:02:15.040> we're<00:02:15.220> doing<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:16.120> we're<00:02:16.780> creating<00:02:16.989> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
what we're doing is we're creating a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.640 
what we're doing is we're creating a
long<00:02:18.310> vivo<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> three<00:02:19.810> millimeter<00:02:20.410> long

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
long vivo about a three millimeter long

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
long vivo about a three millimeter long
bevel<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:21.460> very<00:02:21.880> shallow<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:23.110> intention

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
bevel but very shallow the intention

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.840 
bevel but very shallow the intention
is<00:02:23.830> not<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.430> reduce<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> point<00:02:27.610> where

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
is not to reduce to to the point where

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.130 
is not to reduce to to the point where
we<00:02:28.000> lose<00:02:28.300> enamel

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
we lose enamel

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.470 
we lose enamel
this<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.560> what<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> purpose<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.610> creating<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
this is what the purpose of creating a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.920 
this is what the purpose of creating a
nice<00:02:31.690> transition<00:02:32.410> between<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.930> composite

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
nice transition between the composite

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.830 
nice transition between the composite
and<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.320> tooth<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:36.370> we're<00:02:36.670> edging<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.540> tooth

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
and the tooth now we're edging the tooth

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.920 
and the tooth now we're edging the tooth
with<00:02:38.260> high<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.910> phosphoric<00:02:39.910> acid<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> ultra

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
with high with phosphoric acid the ultra

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.710 
with high with phosphoric acid the ultra
dent<00:02:41.140> phosphoric<00:02:41.860> acid<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.480> that's<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
dent phosphoric acid and that's going to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.410 
dent phosphoric acid and that's going to
be<00:02:43.870> done<00:02:44.020> for<00:02:44.290> 20<00:02:44.650> seconds<00:02:45.190> then<00:02:46.000> we're<00:02:46.210> going

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
be done for 20 seconds then we're going

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.720 
be done for 20 seconds then we're going
to<00:02:46.450> apply<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.810> bonding<00:02:47.530> system<00:02:47.830> as<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.460> see

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to apply a bonding system as you can see

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.530 
to apply a bonding system as you can see
I<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.230> use<00:02:50.500> clear<00:02:50.920> fill<00:02:51.190> SC<00:02:51.670> protect<00:02:52.270> and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
I like to use clear fill SC protect and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.200 
I like to use clear fill SC protect and
although<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> restoration<00:02:54.460> is<00:02:54.760> mostly

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
although this is a restoration is mostly

and of course if there is excess we're

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440 
and of course if there is excess we're
going<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.620> remove<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.940> need<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.240> make<00:03:52.420> sure

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
going to remove it we need to make sure

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.680 
going to remove it we need to make sure
that<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.290> material<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.430> flush<00:03:55.300> with<00:03:55.570> the

that the material is is flush with the
tooth<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.530> material<00:03:57.160> needs<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.580> be<00:03:57.700> cured

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
tooth the material needs to be cured

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.110 
tooth the material needs to be cured
only<00:03:58.870> one<00:03:59.140> cycle<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.190> composite<00:04:00.580> is<00:04:00.880> not

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
only one cycle so the composite is not

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.080 
only one cycle so the composite is not
super<00:04:01.600> hard<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.380> as<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.890> see<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.820> area

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
super hard so as you can see this area

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.120 
super hard so as you can see this area
so<00:04:04.450> will<00:04:04.660> go<00:04:04.840> right<00:04:05.140> through<00:04:05.200> without<00:04:05.740> too

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so will go right through without too

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.699 
so will go right through without too
many<00:04:06.250> complications<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:08.050> shape<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that idea wax up with the ideal occlusal

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.229 
that idea wax up with the ideal occlusal
shapes<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:17.380> see<00:04:18.010> how<00:04:18.130> easy<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.700> area<00:04:19.060> so

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
shapes and you see how easy this area so

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.970 
shapes and you see how easy this area so
is<00:04:19.419> going<00:04:19.690> right<00:04:19.930> through<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.440> teeth<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
is going right through the teeth and

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.150 
is going right through the teeth and
this<00:04:21.640> step<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.500> direct<00:04:23.500> composite

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
this step of direct composite

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.400 
this step of direct composite
restorations<00:04:24.820> can<00:04:25.090> be<00:04:25.240> done<00:04:25.480> in<00:04:25.750> under<00:04:26.080> an
