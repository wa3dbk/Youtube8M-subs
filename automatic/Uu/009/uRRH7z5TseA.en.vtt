scripture<00:01:06.150> itself<00:01:06.390> encourages<00:01:06.990> yeah<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
scripture itself encourages yeah so

without spending much time in that so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.349 
without spending much time in that so
obviously<00:01:10.079> next<00:01:10.439> thing<00:01:10.649> is<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.829> if<00:01:11.789> we<00:01:12.000> ask<00:01:12.149> a

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
obviously next thing is that if we ask a

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.969 
obviously next thing is that if we ask a
saint<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> pray<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.140> somebody<00:01:13.350> who's<00:01:13.560> holier

saint to pray for somebody who's holier

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.459 
saint to pray for somebody who's holier
obviously<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.509> says<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.840> liturgy

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
obviously you know it says in liturgy

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.690 
obviously you know it says in liturgy
you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.829> they<00:01:17.009> were<00:01:17.039> friends<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> God

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you know they they were friends of God

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
you know they they were friends of God
so<00:01:18.329> obviously<00:01:18.960> God<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.259> gonna<00:01:19.439> listen<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> his

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so obviously God is gonna listen to his

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
so obviously God is gonna listen to his
friends<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.700> you're<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.999> closer<00:01:21.240> friend<00:01:21.600> than

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
friends if you're a closer friend than

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.330 
friends if you're a closer friend than
somebody<00:01:22.350> else<00:01:22.499> that<00:01:22.679> goes<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> listen<00:01:23.219> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
somebody else that goes to listen to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.410 
somebody else that goes to listen to
your<00:01:23.460> closer<00:01:23.909> friend

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
your closer friend

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
your closer friend
I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.749> God<00:01:25.109> forbid<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.649> know<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> drug

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I think God forbid if you know a drug

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
I think God forbid if you know a drug
dealer<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.270> should<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> asked<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.929> person

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
dealer you should have asked that person

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.800 
dealer you should have asked that person
to<00:01:28.409> pray<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> yeah<00:01:29.189> yeah<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to pray for you yeah yeah you have a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.060 
to pray for you yeah yeah you have a
sense<00:01:31.109> that<00:01:31.320> maybe<00:01:31.469> their<00:01:31.679> prayers<00:01:31.859> aren't

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sense that maybe their prayers aren't

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
sense that maybe their prayers aren't
gonna<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> lot<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> value<00:01:33.840> yes<00:01:34.140> but

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
gonna be have a lot of value yes but

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
gonna be have a lot of value yes but
conversely<00:01:34.859> someone<00:01:35.549> who's<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.729> close<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
conversely someone who's very close to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
conversely someone who's very close to
God

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
God

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.209 
God
yeah<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> sense<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> he<00:01:38.069> was

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
yeah there's the sense of that he was

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.789 
yeah there's the sense of that he was
even<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.789> job<00:01:39.060> Joe<00:01:39.659> prayed<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:40.350> yeah
