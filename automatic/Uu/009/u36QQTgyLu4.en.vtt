00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
start off we will start the benchmarks

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
start off we will start the benchmarks
and<00:01:10.170> we'll<00:01:10.439> start<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> quadrant<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.790> have

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and we'll start with quadrant I have

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
and we'll start with quadrant I have
already<00:01:12.390> drawn<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> quadrant<00:01:13.200> benchmark<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
already drawn the quadrant benchmark so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.070 
already drawn the quadrant benchmark so
let<00:01:13.920> me<00:01:14.040> show<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> course<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.830 
other I also ran the epics digital at
the<00:01:55.049> highest<00:01:55.320> setting<00:01:55.649> possible<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.540> as<00:01:57.540> you

can see at the ultra high performance

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.639 
can see at the ultra high performance
this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> highest<00:02:00.689> setting<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.619> I

this is the highest setting and here I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
close to each other yes this Asian

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.080 
close to each other yes this Asian
Edition<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.590> clocked<00:02:28.920> at<00:02:29.100> 2.5<00:02:29.760> gigahertz

Edition that is clocked at 2.5 gigahertz

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.780 
Edition that is clocked at 2.5 gigahertz
is<00:02:30.360> slightly<00:02:30.750> faster<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:32.040> very<00:02:32.430> fast

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
is slightly faster but not very fast

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.220 
is slightly faster but not very fast
compared<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.390> International<00:02:33.840> Version<00:02:33.960> I

compared to the International Version I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
compared to the International Version I
would<00:02:34.590> say<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.220> couple<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.670> percentage

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
would say just a couple of percentage

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
would say just a couple of percentage
points<00:02:36.210> faster<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> huge<00:02:37.740> difference

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
points faster so not a huge difference

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.420 
points faster so not a huge difference
and<00:02:38.420> also<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.660> HTC<00:02:40.230> One<00:02:40.440> m8<00:02:40.740> comes<00:02:41.160> with<00:02:41.400> a

128 gigs of SD card and the good thing

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
128 gigs of SD card and the good thing
is<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.370> move<00:02:47.550> some<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.420> apps<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
is that we can move some of the apps to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
is that we can move some of the apps to
the<00:02:48.930> SD<00:02:49.020> card<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.980> let<00:02:50.489> me<00:02:50.610> show<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.820> how<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the SD card and let me show you how to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.650 
the SD card and let me show you how to
do<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.330> same<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.620> settings<00:02:53.660> and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
do the same just go to the settings and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.630 
do the same just go to the settings and
here<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.590> move<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> app<00:02:56.310> section<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:59.489> have

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
here you move to the app section we have

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180 
here you move to the app section we have
it<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.050> see<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it and here you see and go to the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.100 
it and here you see and go to the
downloaded<00:03:02.640> tab<00:03:02.820> here<00:03:03.330> are<00:03:03.510> all<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.959> apps

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
downloaded tab here are all the apps

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
downloaded tab here are all the apps
that<00:03:04.260> ah<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.280> downloaded<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:06.239> note<00:03:06.420> that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
that ah you have downloaded do note that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.870 
that ah you have downloaded do note that
not<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.350> apps<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:08.130> moved<00:03:08.370> for

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
not all of the apps can be moved for

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.420 
not all of the apps can be moved for
example<00:03:09.300> if<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.690> go<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.110> chrome<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:11.310> app

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
example if you go to the chrome the app

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.910 
example if you go to the chrome the app
the<00:03:11.790> option<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.239> move<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.780> disabled<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.890> for

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
the option to move is disabled and for

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.490 
the option to move is disabled and for
example<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:15.180> antutu<00:03:15.600> benchmark<00:03:15.720> also<00:03:16.350> it's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
example on antutu benchmark also it's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.650 
example on antutu benchmark also it's
disabled<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.280> some<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.820> apps<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.239> be

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
disabled and some of the apps can be

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.660 
disabled and some of the apps can be
moved<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.230> example<00:03:19.850> let<00:03:20.850> me<00:03:20.880> show<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:22.670> for

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
moved for example let me show you for

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.350 
moved for example let me show you for
example<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.360> go<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.540> bloom<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
example if you go to bloom we have the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.910 
example if you go to bloom we have the
SD<00:03:27.570> card<00:03:27.780> option<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> move

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
SD card option and we have the move

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.460 
SD card option and we have the move
option<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.459> if<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.640> hit<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.940> move<00:03:30.150> option<00:03:30.600> it

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
option now if I hit this move option it

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.620 
option now if I hit this move option it
says<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.890> app<00:03:32.070> will<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.730> moved<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.299> SD
