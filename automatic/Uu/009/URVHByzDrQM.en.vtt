00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.610
 when it seemed that everything was 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.500
 invented in the world of tablets 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.120
 all tablets are similar 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.679
 big smaller ones thinner more 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.829
 thick but almost all are similar 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.989
 arrives lenovo this the Chinese manufacturer the 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.939
 that a few years ago bought in the 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.519
 bm personal computing division 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.679
 and that we know perfectly their 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.539
 laptops in Spain 'and computers 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.189
 laptops that are some of the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.380
 better because not to say the least- 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.720
 there are in the market, they come again and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.029
 teaches us presents this tablet is 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.070
 called yoga and it's completely different 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.870
 has is very original with respect to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.280
 others that are in the market first thing 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.530
 that we can see good is a tablet of 10 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.500
 inches is a tablet that in its part 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.030
 end is extremely thin just 35 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.489
 millimeters less than in any other 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.460
 but that has the characteristic of this 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.860
 flange this kind of flange 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 rounded and that it serves us to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.660
 hold it to catch it as if it were the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 back of a book that happens this part 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.650
 it weighs much more than this other then the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.120
 center of gravity is absolutely 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.100
 displaced so that we do not fall 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.440
 hand even if we put it in this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.119
 position is quite comfortable to grab 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.009
 but for what is this 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 space this space takes advantage of being 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.450
 used to equip this tablet with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
 one of its main characteristics 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.550
 that is a huge battery all this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 here is a battery and that battery we 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.399
 allows one to have it on and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.869
 working with him 18 hours in a row what 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.610
 which is a barbarity compared to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.740
 other tablets that barely make you 5 or 6 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.080
 hours or even with an ipad that you 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.810
 10 working since it is almost double 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.539
 all that is thanks to this battery not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 the origin and originality end there 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.930
 it's forgiveness 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.240
 this same same same 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.399
 structure that we have here we see that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.050
 here it has a rim and that's not 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.960
 coincidence because simply doing 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.030
 We can open this when we open it. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 got a support 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 allows to keep the tablet in position 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 horizontal on top of a table to see 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.159
 movies that allows us equally 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.990
 keep it in this elevated position for 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.640
 write or to play only 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 unfolding this that is always the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 put and we also see that here there 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.560
 some are for example 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.420
 the hole to put a microsd card 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.510
 to expand the memory and for a 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.510
 sim card to have 3g connectivity or 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.890
 4g this simply closes and already what 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.330
 we can transport reminds us of 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.400
 way ergonomics does not cost a bit 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.890
 maybe to these keyboards those who have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 a feather that looks like this at home 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.760
 keyboard with the round keys we see 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.000
 that on the edges here we have the key 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.350
 of ignition and here is in the entrance 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.350
 for headphones 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.240
 the screen is a high ips screen 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.010
 definition and inside we find android 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.360
 the operating system android the last 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.270
 Android version that we are not going to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.460
 extend because we already know how it works 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.340
 the originality of this tablet is in 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.860
 what I just explained and one of your 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.810
 biggest advantages is the price despite 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.110
 which carries a four processor 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 nuclei to 1.2 gigahertz which is a 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.310
 a lot of power because this 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.770
 device costs less than 300 euros 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.820
 It costs 299 euros 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.740
 the internal memory is 16 GB but it is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.900
 expandable with a microsd card that 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.870
 we can put them up to 64 with 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.220
 which is a different option is a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.220
 option for which it is again 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.820
 betting a lot and as I say very 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.820
 original
