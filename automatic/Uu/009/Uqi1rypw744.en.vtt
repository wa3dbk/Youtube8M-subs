00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
out but essentially what he's going to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.710 
out but essentially what he's going to
be<00:00:38.070> doing<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.640> gameplay<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
be doing here in this gameplay is just

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.700 
be doing here in this gameplay is just
showing<00:00:39.870> us<00:00:40.019> a<00:00:40.050> whole<00:00:40.320> bunch<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.650> different

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
showing us a whole bunch of different

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.079 
showing us a whole bunch of different
features<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.580> will<00:00:41.729> be<00:00:41.850> seeing

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
features that we will be seeing

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.780 
features that we will be seeing
obviously<00:00:42.900> into<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.290> 19<00:00:43.830> so<00:00:44.339> right<00:00:44.519> here<00:00:44.699> he's

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
obviously into you 19 so right here he's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.890 
obviously into you 19 so right here he's
going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.970> go<00:00:45.059> ahead<00:00:45.119> and<00:00:45.239> spawn<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.720> weather

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
going to go ahead and spawn the weather

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.719 
going to go ahead and spawn the weather
so<00:00:46.080> we<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.500> exactly<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.280> process

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
so we can see exactly what this process

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.729 
so we can see exactly what this process
is<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.089> to<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.449> like<00:00:48.479> when<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.619> next

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
is going to look like when when the next

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.829 
is going to look like when when the next
update<00:00:49.979> does<00:00:50.400> release<00:00:50.729> now<00:00:50.970> bear<00:00:51.299> in<00:00:51.330> mind<00:00:51.600> as

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
update does release now bear in mind as

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.359 
update does release now bear in mind as
we<00:00:51.869> watch<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.229> that<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.920> taking<00:00:53.339> place

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
we watch this that this is taking place

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.789 
we watch this that this is taking place
on<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.909> believe<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:55.140> skyrim<00:00:55.619> mash-up

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
on what I believe is the skyrim mash-up

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.530 
on what I believe is the skyrim mash-up
XO<00:00:56.369> if<00:00:56.489> things<00:00:56.670> look<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.909> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.210> weird<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
XO if things look a little bit weird and

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.000 
XO if things look a little bit weird and
a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.809> strange<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.680> obviously

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
a little bit strange that's obviously

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.320 
a little bit strange that's obviously
because<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> mash-up<00:00:59.760> pack<00:00:59.939> that<00:01:00.119> they<00:01:00.239> are

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
because the mash-up pack that they are

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.729 
because the mash-up pack that they are
using<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.839> obviously<00:01:01.229> different<00:01:01.409> than<00:01:01.650> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
using is obviously different than the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.469 
using is obviously different than the
default<00:01:01.860> one<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.939> can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
default one and so you can see there the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.609 
default one and so you can see there the
weather<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.750> went<00:01:03.960> ahead<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> took<00:01:04.409> off

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
weather just went ahead and took off

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
weather just went ahead and took off
flew<00:01:04.890> away<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> start<00:01:06.240> blowing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
flew away and is going to start blowing

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.609 
flew away and is going to start blowing
stuff<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.140> probably<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> main

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
stuff up and that's probably the main

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.440 
stuff up and that's probably the main
thing<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:08.130> excited<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> next<00:01:09.030> update

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
thing I'm excited for this next update

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.840 
thing I'm excited for this next update
is<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> boss<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.280> allows<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
to go ahead and make his way through the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
to go ahead and make his way through the
menu<00:01:19.410> showing<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.010> items<00:01:20.160> now<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
menu showing all of the items now this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
menu showing all of the items now this
footage<00:01:21.060> isn't<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.480> most<00:01:21.630> clear<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
footage isn't the most clear so it is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.900 
footage isn't the most clear so it is
kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.010> hard<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.250> make<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.520> some<00:01:23.760> of<00:01:23.820> the

fact<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.670> Skyrim

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
fact that it is on the the Skyrim

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.700 
fact that it is on the the Skyrim
texture<00:01:27.720> pack<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.140> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> hard<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.620> tell

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
texture pack it is kind of hard to tell

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
texture pack it is kind of hard to tell
what<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> things<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.450> he's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
what some of the things are that he's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
what some of the things are that he's
actually<00:01:30.750> working<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
actually working with but here you can

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.680 
actually working with but here you can
see<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> obviously<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.030> trap<00:01:33.120> chest

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
see this is obviously a trap chest

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540 
see this is obviously a trap chest
because<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.260> opens<00:01:34.620> it<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> got<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
because as he opens it it got it it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.510 
because as he opens it it got it it
sends<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.450> redstone<00:01:36.750> signal<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.440> you<00:01:38.370> can

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
sends off a redstone signal and you can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
sends off a redstone signal and you can
see<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> piston<00:01:39.210> activates<00:01:39.600> over

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
see there the piston activates over

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
see there the piston activates over
there<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> side<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.610> use

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
there off to the side so you can use

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
there off to the side so you can use
that<00:01:42.000> obviously<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.450> set<00:01:42.600> off<00:01:42.690> TNT<00:01:42.870> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that obviously to set off TNT and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.930 
that obviously to set off TNT and
different<00:01:43.620> things<00:01:43.650> he's<00:01:44.580> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.850> ahead

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
different things he's going to go ahead

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.250 
different things he's going to go ahead
and<00:01:45.090> keep<00:01:45.360> making<00:01:45.540> his<00:01:45.810> way<00:01:45.930> through<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
and keep making his way through the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.810 
and keep making his way through the
menus<00:01:46.680> taking<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> look<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.460> some<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
menus taking a look at some of the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.920 
menus taking a look at some of the
different<00:01:48.090> things<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
different things you can see there the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
different things you can see there the
wither<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.440> shooting<00:01:50.310> stuff<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
different things around the map let's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.680 
different things around the map let's
see<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.549> he's<00:01:56.820> getting<00:01:57.330> he's<00:01:57.420> gonna<00:01:57.510> grab

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
see I think he's getting he's gonna grab

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.880 
see I think he's getting he's gonna grab
some<00:01:57.840> spawn<00:01:58.080> eggs<00:01:58.260> now<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:58.590> he's<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.830> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
some spawn eggs now so he's going to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.580 
some spawn eggs now so he's going to
spawn<00:01:59.190> in<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> couple<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> horses<00:02:00.120> um<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.560> maybe

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
spawn in a couple of horses um and maybe

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
spawn in a couple of horses um and maybe
the<00:02:02.310> witch<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.120> bats<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.600> can't<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.930> can't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the witch and bats I can't I can't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
the witch and bats I can't I can't
recall<00:02:04.260> exactly<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> guess<00:02:05.490> we're<00:02:05.610> gonna

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
recall exactly but I guess we're gonna

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.980 
recall exactly but I guess we're gonna
see<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:05.970> just<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> moment<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.600> obviously

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
see here just a moment but obviously

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330 
see here just a moment but obviously
here's<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> first<00:02:07.470> gameplay<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.099> said

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
here's the first gameplay like I said

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
here's the first gameplay like I said
this<00:02:08.940> isn't<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> clearest<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this isn't the clearest it is kind of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.479 
this isn't the clearest it is kind of
blurry<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> hard<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.159> some<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
blurry and hard to see some of the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
blurry and hard to see some of the
things<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.760> he's<00:02:11.909> actually<00:02:12.120> working<00:02:12.390> with

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
things that he's actually working with

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.509 
things that he's actually working with
when<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.440> downloaded<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.069> video<00:02:14.190> from

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
when I downloaded the video from

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.190 
when I downloaded the video from
Facebook<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:14.970> show<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.269> guys<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Facebook to show you guys I think it was

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890 
Facebook to show you guys I think it was
in<00:02:16.349> 360p<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.459> I've<00:02:17.879> tried<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.450> blow<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.689> up<00:02:18.779> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
in 360p so I've tried to blow it up and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.420 
in 360p so I've tried to blow it up and
make<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.049> as<00:02:19.319> clean<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.709> possible<00:02:19.769> here<00:02:20.279> but

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
make it as clean as possible here but

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.649 
make it as clean as possible here but
this<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.639> kind<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.879> we're<00:02:21.029> working<00:02:21.299> with<00:02:21.420> here

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
this is kind of we're working with here

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.460 
this is kind of we're working with here
you<00:02:22.109> can<00:02:22.260> see

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you can see

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.350 
you can see
he<00:02:22.620> shooting<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:23.520> fireworks<00:02:23.940> into<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
sky where you can obviously tell that

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.130 
sky where you can obviously tell that
these<00:02:26.640> are<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> pre-made<00:02:27.300> fireworks<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:27.870> 4j

fireworks you have to craft them all
yourself<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.190> uh<00:02:35.220> i<00:02:35.730> guess<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.300> year's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
yourself but uh i guess for this year's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.910 
yourself but uh i guess for this year's
when<00:02:36.660> i<00:02:36.690> had<00:02:36.840> made<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.050> little<00:02:37.320> bit<00:02:37.500> easier<00:02:37.650> on

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
when i had made a little bit easier on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
when i had made a little bit easier on
us<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.490> i<00:02:38.610> said<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.910> today's<00:02:39.150> earlier<00:02:39.450> video

where uh where I made that beer we look
at<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.420> screenshots<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.310> anyway<00:02:44.310> there<00:02:44.460> you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
at the screenshots so anyway there you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.620 
at the screenshots so anyway there you
can<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:44.700> some<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> fireworks<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.480> how

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
can see some of the fireworks and how

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.300 
can see some of the fireworks and how
they<00:02:45.780> work<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:46.470> he's<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.860> go<00:02:46.950> ahead<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
they work now he's going to go ahead and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.160 
they work now he's going to go ahead and
spawn<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.880> some<00:02:48.090> horses<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.630> some<00:02:48.750> donkeys

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
spawn in some horses and some donkeys

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.750 
spawn in some horses and some donkeys
it's<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.860> kind<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> hard<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.340> tell<00:02:50.400> what

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it's really kind of hard to tell what

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.100 
it's really kind of hard to tell what
exactly<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.300> are<00:02:51.420> almost<00:02:51.660> look<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.930> they

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
exactly they are almost look like they

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.630 
exactly they are almost look like they
have<00:02:52.200> horns<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.040> assume<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.460> don't

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
have horns which I assume they don't

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
have horns which I assume they don't
because<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.360> know<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.630> how<00:02:54.690> horses

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
because that's you know not how horses

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.170 
because that's you know not how horses
and<00:02:55.530> donkeys<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.010> things<00:02:56.190> work<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.150> can

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and donkeys and things work but you can

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.430 
and donkeys and things work but you can
see<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> withers<00:02:58.020> obviously

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
see here the withers obviously

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.690 
see here the withers obviously
destroying<00:02:58.800> everything<00:02:59.040> he<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.459> spawned

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
destroying everything he just spawned

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
destroying everything he just spawned
and<00:02:59.970> creating<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.570> whole<00:03:00.810> bunch<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.110> havoc<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and creating a whole bunch of havoc and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620 
and creating a whole bunch of havoc and
I<00:03:02.100> think<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.580> probably<00:03:02.850> about<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
I think that's probably about it for the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.610 
I think that's probably about it for the
gameplay<00:03:03.900> yep<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.140> looks<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.410> that's<00:03:04.500> about

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
gameplay yep it looks like that's about

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.230 
gameplay yep it looks like that's about
all<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.490> we're<00:03:05.610> going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.850> seeing<00:03:06.030> here
