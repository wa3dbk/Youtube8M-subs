00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 do not 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.840
 hello here you have more game solutions 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.910
 from facebook photos and words like ya 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 you know unfortunately we do not get out 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 all in the same order then to what 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.349
 better 1820 is your 25 is the bad thing that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 have this game and look for the solutions 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 but you can not do anything like you have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
 luck and I will do it in the same order as 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 me or not the good thing is that if I 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 you have more or less updated the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.140
 latest videos will coincide with your 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 solutions then if you imagine that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.880
 up 100 new solutions and you do not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.740
 you have updated as surely between 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.010
 two or three videos in which the rise 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.950
 is your solution that's the good thing 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.930
 that has take the game pretty much 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.670
 as I carry it for those who do not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.270
 You know always go up 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.610
 updates as they go out 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 then if it is not in this video it will be 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.520
 in another video you can access them 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.619
 from this same video you give 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.229
 in the description information you give to 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.659

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.240
