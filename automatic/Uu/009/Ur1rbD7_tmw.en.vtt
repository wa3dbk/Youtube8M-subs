00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey what's up guys we are here with the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey what's up guys we are here with the
Takeda<00:00:03.360> character<00:00:04.170> breakdown<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.100> guys

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
Takeda character breakdown if you guys

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.530 
Takeda character breakdown if you guys
haven't<00:00:05.520> seen<00:00:05.580> my<00:00:05.730> character<00:00:06.060> breakdown<00:00:06.390> so

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
haven't seen my character breakdown so

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.600 
haven't seen my character breakdown so
basically<00:00:06.839> talk<00:00:07.109> about<00:00:07.140> normals<00:00:07.830> strings

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
basically talk about normals strings

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.339 
basically talk about normals strings
special<00:00:09.090> moves<00:00:09.269> differences<00:00:09.809> between<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
special moves differences between the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.530 
special moves differences between the
characters<00:00:10.769> variations<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.210> general

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
characters variations just a general

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.379 
characters variations just a general
gameplan<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.200> Takeda<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> very<00:00:15.089> interesting

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
gameplan so Takeda is a very interesting

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.939 
gameplan so Takeda is a very interesting
character<00:00:15.719> right<00:00:16.020> he<00:00:16.170> doesn't<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.590> huge

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
character right he doesn't have huge

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.500 
character right he doesn't have huge
really<00:00:17.310> fast<00:00:17.520> walk<00:00:17.760> speed<00:00:18.000> forward<00:00:18.390> or

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
really fast walk speed forward or

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540 
really fast walk speed forward or
backwards<00:00:18.900> his<00:00:19.740> run<00:00:19.920> speed<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.250> pretty<00:00:20.400> good

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
backwards his run speed is pretty good

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.070 
backwards his run speed is pretty good
you<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> best<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.869> it's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you know it's not the best but it's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
you know it's not the best but it's
pretty<00:00:22.500> decent<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.670> he<00:00:23.789> does<00:00:23.970> have

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
pretty decent the one thing he does have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
pretty decent the one thing he does have
going<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.660> him<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:25.109> his<00:00:25.170> normals<00:00:25.920> his

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
going for him are his normals his

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
going for him are his normals his
normals<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.939> far<00:00:27.720> away

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
normals are so far away

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.990 
normals are so far away
they<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.800> incredible<00:00:29.130> space<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they have incredible space like as you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
they have incredible space like as you
can<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.570> that's<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.439> far<00:00:31.769> he<00:00:31.859> has<00:00:31.980> an

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
can see here that's really far he has an

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
can see here that's really far he has an
overhead<00:00:32.430> string<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.809> goes

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
overhead string like that that goes

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
overhead string like that that goes
really<00:00:34.140> far<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.500> well

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
really far as well

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.580 
really far as well
his<00:00:36.270> normals<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.809> cover<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> distance

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
his normals just cover a lot of distance

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
his normals just cover a lot of distance
and<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.550> different<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> types<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and he has different you know types of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.330 
and he has different you know types of
normals<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.500> different<00:00:40.800> stances<00:00:41.129> each

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
normals in different stances each

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
normals in different stances each
besides<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> other<00:00:42.690> two

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
besides this one the other two

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.040 
besides this one the other two
variations<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:44.360> unique<00:00:45.360> normals<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
variations have unique normals that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
variations have unique normals that
we'll<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.500> once<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.800> cover<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.129> but

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
we'll get into once we cover them but

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
we'll get into once we cover them but
you<00:00:47.760> guys<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.090> take<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.600> for

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you guys can take a look at them for

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
you guys can take a look at them for
yourself<00:00:49.500> he<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.700> far<00:00:50.879> range

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
yourself he has he has really far range

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.299 
yourself he has he has really far range
normals<00:00:51.899> though<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
normals though so that is one of the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
normals though so that is one of the
bonuses<00:00:53.699> he<00:00:53.879> has<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.449> when<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.989> start<00:00:55.260> looking

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
bonuses he has now when we start looking

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.479 
bonuses he has now when we start looking
at<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.710> normals<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> thing<00:00:56.460> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
at these normals one of the thing that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
at these normals one of the thing that's
important<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> guys<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> double

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
important you guys see the double

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.770 
important you guys see the double
overhead<00:00:58.190> he<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.550> first<00:00:59.760> universal<00:01:00.420> special

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
overhead he has first universal special

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
overhead he has first universal special
move<00:01:00.930> besides<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.920> guess<00:01:02.129> Ronin<00:01:02.579> Ronan's<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
move besides I guess Ronin Ronan's a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.950 
move besides I guess Ronin Ronan's a
little<00:01:03.210> different<00:01:03.539> he's<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> those

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little different he's one of those

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.390 
little different he's one of those
characters<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.799> his<00:01:04.920> variations

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
characters where two of his variations

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
characters where two of his variations
are<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.729> much<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> same<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> them

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
are pretty much the same but one of them

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.550 
are pretty much the same but one of them
is<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.030> pretty<00:01:09.030> wacky<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> lot

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
is just pretty wacky so it's a lot

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
is just pretty wacky so it's a lot
different<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.040> Ronin<00:01:11.430> doesn't<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
different so Ronin doesn't have this but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
different so Ronin doesn't have this but
it<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:13.049> something<00:01:13.530> similar<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.159> his<00:01:14.490> down

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it has something similar it's his down

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.810 
it has something similar it's his down
back<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.259> low<00:01:16.740> kunai<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.700> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
back one which is a low kunai so we can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
back one which is a low kunai so we can
do<00:01:17.880> overhead<00:01:18.299> low<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.350> can

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
do overhead low like that and you can

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
do overhead low like that and you can
throw<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> kunai<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.640> close<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:22.140> far

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
throw the kunai you know close or far

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
throw the kunai you know close or far
the<00:01:22.950> X<00:01:23.220> version<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> kunai<00:01:23.880> throws<00:01:24.180> three

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the X version of the kunai throws three

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
the X version of the kunai throws three
on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> ground<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.049> hold<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> then

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
on the ground that you can hold and then

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
on the ground that you can hold and then
explode<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.180> explode

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
explode or you can make them explode

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
explode or you can make them explode
instantly<00:01:27.689> either<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.259> he<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.369> has<00:01:29.790> his

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
instantly either one he also has his

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
instantly either one he also has his
flip<00:01:30.390> kick<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.470> forward<00:01:31.799> three

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
flip kick which is back forward three

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
flip kick which is back forward three

simplifying<00:01:36.299> things<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
simplifying things and you can do the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
simplifying things and you can do the
close<00:01:37.799> version<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> Far

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
close version of it you can do the Far

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
close version of it you can do the Far
version<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.710> overhead<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
version of it and it's an overhead if it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.830 
version of it and it's an overhead if it
hits<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> e<00:01:42.090> X<00:01:42.270> version<00:01:42.600> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
hits it also has the e X version like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
hits it also has the e X version like
that<00:01:43.399> does<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:44.610> damage<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> X

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that does pretty good damage and the X

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.789 
that does pretty good damage and the X
version<00:01:45.659> passed<00:01:45.840> him<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> combo<00:01:46.649> there

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
version passed him up for a combo there

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.120 
version passed him up for a combo there
was<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.130> well<00:01:47.689> then<00:01:48.689> he<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.140> has<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
was that as well then he also has the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.490 
was that as well then he also has the
this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> his<00:01:51.060> main<00:01:51.240> B&amp;B<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.899> home<00:01:52.140> will<00:01:52.320> move

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this is his main B&amp;B like home will move

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
this is his main B&amp;B like home will move
so<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> ki<00:01:53.490> exit<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so when you ki exit you can get a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.700 
so when you ki exit you can get a
neutral<00:01:54.509> jump<00:01:54.780> punch<00:01:54.960> stuff<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
neutral jump punch stuff like that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
neutral jump punch stuff like that
looks<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.399> don't<00:01:56.610> nee<00:01:56.700> acts

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
looks like this what you don't nee acts

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
looks like this what you don't nee acts
it<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> knock<00:01:57.450> down<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it just to knock down so that is the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889 
it just to knock down so that is the
main<00:01:59.009> move<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.490> confirms<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> new<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
main move that he confirms in a new to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.870 
main move that he confirms in a new to
for<00:02:01.259> combos<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.680> those<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:02.549> kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> his

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
for combos so those are kind of his

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420 
for combos so those are kind of his
universal<00:02:03.450> moves<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.200> his<00:02:04.619> she<00:02:05.280> died

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
which is down back three and as you can

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.309 
which is down back three and as you can
see<00:02:11.129> there<00:02:11.310> he<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> holds<00:02:12.989> himself<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
see there he kind of holds himself to

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000 
see there he kind of holds himself to
the<00:02:13.410> ground<00:02:13.560> first

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the ground first

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.309 
the ground first
if<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.580> hold<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.940> button<00:02:15.170> then<00:02:16.170> you'll

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
if you hold the a button then you'll

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.369 
if you hold the a button then you'll
wait<00:02:16.620> longer<00:02:17.129> if<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.019> double<00:02:19.019> tap<00:02:19.049> down

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
wait longer if you double tap down

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.110 
wait longer if you double tap down
you'll<00:02:19.650> cancel<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> teleport<00:02:20.849> but<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
you'll cancel the teleport but if you

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.930 
you'll cancel the teleport but if you
guys<00:02:21.209> notice<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> upper<00:02:22.110> left<00:02:22.290> my<00:02:22.440> stamina

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
guys notice in the upper left my stamina

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
guys notice in the upper left my stamina
actually<00:02:23.940> depletes<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.319> cancel<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
actually depletes if I cancel it so you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.550 
actually depletes if I cancel it so you
lose<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> bar<00:02:26.909> of<00:02:27.030> stamina<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> cancel<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:27.989> so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
lose a bar of stamina to cancel that so

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.630 
lose a bar of stamina to cancel that so
that<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.799> something<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> keep<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.340> mind<00:02:29.519> you

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
that is something to keep in mind you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.130 
that is something to keep in mind you
can<00:02:29.670> use<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.120> fake-out<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> there's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
can use the fake-out like that there's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.869

mortal kombat ninja this one's a little

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.390 
mortal kombat ninja this one's a little
bit<00:03:36.569> different<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.169> first<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.919> all<00:03:38.010> he<00:03:38.160> has<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
bit different so first of all he has a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.460 
bit different so first of all he has a
unique<00:03:38.579> normal<00:03:39.090> which<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.329> down<00:03:39.510> forward<00:03:40.019> one

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
unique normal which is down forward one

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.440 
unique normal which is down forward one
right<00:03:40.919> there<00:03:41.099> right<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.730> called<00:03:41.910> low<00:03:42.120> I

for<00:04:07.079> combos<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.849> X<00:04:09.000> version<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.329> it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
for combos if you do the X version of it

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.289 
for combos if you do the X version of it
it'll<00:04:09.750> pop<00:04:09.959> up<00:04:09.989> jump<00:04:10.709> attacks<00:04:10.980> go<00:04:11.669> into<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.910> BM<00:04:12.180> B

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299

he also has a low which is down back -
so<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.540> makes<00:04:15.750> his<00:04:15.959> mix-ups<00:04:16.380> very<00:04:16.620> scary

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
so that makes his mix-ups very scary

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.620 
so that makes his mix-ups very scary
right<00:04:17.160> cuz<00:04:17.280> he<00:04:17.370> has<00:04:17.459> overhead<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.479> you're

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
right cuz he has overhead so you're

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.449 
right cuz he has overhead so you're
gonna<00:04:18.720> overhead<00:04:19.199> low<00:04:19.440> with<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.949> which<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
gonna overhead low with that which you

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.060 
gonna overhead low with that which you
know<00:04:20.549> previously<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.329> can<00:04:21.449> do<00:04:21.539> overhead

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
know previously you can do overhead

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.830 
know previously you can do overhead
overhead<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.250> overhead<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:23.969> cancel<00:04:24.330> into<00:04:24.479> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
overhead or overhead and cancel into the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.719 
overhead or overhead and cancel into the
crew<00:04:25.409> nya<00:04:25.560> for<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.919> as<00:04:26.099> well<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.460> have<00:04:26.550> an

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
crew nya for that as well so you have an

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
additional ways to do it and then

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.620 
additional ways to do it and then
the<00:04:27.990> X<00:04:28.230> lo<00:04:28.410> toss<00:04:28.800> up<00:04:29.040> into<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.370> combo<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.450> yeah

footsies and the calming with that right

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.570 
footsies and the calming with that right
with<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.500> know<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:37.919> move<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.340> everything

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
with you know this move and everything

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.110 
with you know this move and everything
like<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.740> yeah<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.370> cicadas

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
like that so yeah this is like cicadas

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.870 
like that so yeah this is like cicadas
combo<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.080> more<00:04:43.710> flashy<00:04:44.010> variations<00:04:44.669> more

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
combo and more flashy variations more

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.940 
combo and more flashy variations more
focus<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.450> on<00:04:45.630> landing<00:04:46.080> stuff<00:04:46.320> from<00:04:46.650> about

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
focus on the on landing stuff from about

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.290 
focus on the on landing stuff from about
this<00:04:47.160> range<00:04:47.430> right<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:47.820> this<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.000> where<00:04:48.180> he

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
this range right so this is where he

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.330 
this range right so this is where he
plays<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:49.320> stance<00:04:49.650> with<00:04:49.889> his<00:04:50.010> trip<00:04:50.220> and

plays this this stance with his trip and
everything<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> range<00:04:51.540> he

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
everything that that is the range he

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.780 
everything that that is the range he
wants<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.960> control<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.889> that<00:04:53.040> is<00:04:53.220> what<00:04:53.400> Lasher

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
wants to control so that is what Lasher

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.200 
wants to control so that is what Lasher
is<00:04:53.910> about<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.270> really<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:56.580> know<00:04:56.669> playing

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
is about it's really you know playing

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.500 
is about it's really you know playing
off<00:04:57.480> of<00:04:57.630> his<00:04:57.750> already<00:04:57.990> strong<00:04:58.350> footsie<00:04:58.740> game

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
off of his already strong footsie game

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.500 
off of his already strong footsie game
so<00:05:00.510> this<00:05:01.440> is<00:05:01.680> we<00:05:02.250> stay<00:05:02.460> Ronin<00:05:02.880> for<00:05:03.060> last<00:05:03.270> and

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
so this is we stay Ronin for last and

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.270 
so this is we stay Ronin for last and
you<00:05:03.570> guys<00:05:03.720> will<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:04.050> why<00:05:04.230> so<00:05:04.950> if<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.100> guys<00:05:05.220> are

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
you guys will see why so if you guys are

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.030 
you guys will see why so if you guys are
curious<00:05:05.970> about<00:05:06.270> how<00:05:06.480> you<00:05:06.540> can<00:05:06.780> tell<00:05:06.990> moves<00:05:07.740> are

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
curious about how you can tell moves are

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.330 
curious about how you can tell moves are
specific<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> certain<00:05:09.960> variation<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:11.310> can

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
specific to a certain variation you can

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.140 
specific to a certain variation you can
see<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.300> has<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.690> Ronin<00:05:13.910> Signia<00:05:14.910> here

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
see that it has the Ronin Signia here

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.790 
see that it has the Ronin Signia here
and<00:05:15.360> it's<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.750> yellow<00:05:16.080> right<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.530> he<00:05:16.680> has<00:05:16.770> a

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
and it's in yellow right so he has a

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.230 
and it's in yellow right so he has a
couple<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.160> unique<00:05:17.460> normals<00:05:17.820> in<00:05:17.910> this<00:05:18.030> version

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
couple of unique normals in this version

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.210 
couple of unique normals in this version
I<00:05:18.570> think<00:05:18.780> he<00:05:18.960> has<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> fourth<00:05:19.590> one<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.070> down

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
I think he has a fourth one is it down

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.100 
I think he has a fourth one is it down
here<00:05:20.430> or<00:05:20.729> does<00:05:20.850> he<00:05:20.970> not<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.240> one<00:05:21.390> no<00:05:21.750> it's<00:05:21.990> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
here or does he not that one no it's the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.650 
here or does he not that one no it's the
strings<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.560> are<00:05:22.620> are<00:05:23.310> special<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:23.880> he<00:05:24.510> has

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
strings that are are special so he has

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.390 
strings that are are special so he has
this<00:05:25.050> move<00:05:25.350> right<00:05:25.620> which<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.889> a<00:05:25.919> pretty<00:05:26.130> far

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
this move right which is a pretty far

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.090 
this move right which is a pretty far
rangy<00:05:26.850> move<00:05:27.810> by<00:05:28.050> his<00:05:28.229> back<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.919> long

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
rangy move by his back to that long

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.650 
rangy move by his back to that long
overhead<00:05:29.550> from<00:05:29.729> before<00:05:30.060> gets<00:05:30.300> turned<00:05:30.510> into

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
overhead from before gets turned into

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.750 
overhead from before gets turned into
that<00:05:30.870> which<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.560> now<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:31.979> has<00:05:32.130> an<00:05:32.220> overhead<00:05:32.550> low

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
that which is now it has an overhead low

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.420 
that which is now it has an overhead low
string<00:05:33.090> attached<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.770> with<00:05:34.770> his<00:05:34.979> plasma

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
string attached to it with his plasma

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.520 
string attached to it with his plasma
sword<00:05:35.669> because<00:05:36.000> he<00:05:36.120> no<00:05:36.300> longer<00:05:36.510> has<00:05:36.840> his<00:05:36.870> rangy

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
sword because he no longer has his rangy

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.530 
sword because he no longer has his rangy
hooks<00:05:37.770> he<00:05:38.669> still<00:05:38.850> gets<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.030> keep<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.330> move

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
hooks he still gets to keep this move

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.900 
hooks he still gets to keep this move
but<00:05:40.080> anything<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.590> had<00:05:40.890> his<00:05:41.130> grappling<00:05:41.790> hook

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
but anything that had his grappling hook

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.640 
but anything that had his grappling hook
is<00:05:42.030> kind<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.240> gone<00:05:42.390> he<00:05:42.900> also<00:05:43.050> does<00:05:43.289> not<00:05:43.440> have

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
at all of the new strings he has it all

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.990 
at all of the new strings he has it all
right<00:05:48.960> here<00:05:49.140> he<00:05:49.260> has<00:05:49.289> a<00:05:49.380> bunch<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:49.710> them<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.729> he

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
right here he has a bunch of them so he

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.510 
right here he has a bunch of them so he
has<00:05:51.390> this<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:52.500> was<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.650> move<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.160> there's<00:05:53.460> a

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
has this it was that move and there's a

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.590 
has this it was that move and there's a
couple<00:05:53.669> of<00:05:53.789> different<00:05:54.000> strings<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.330> there<00:05:54.450> but

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
couple of different strings in there but

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.700 
couple of different strings in there but
if<00:05:54.660> you<00:05:54.750> go<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:54.900> his<00:05:55.050> special<00:05:55.350> moves<00:05:55.530> you'll

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
if you go to his special moves you'll

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.830 
if you go to his special moves you'll
see<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.160> he<00:05:56.340> has<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.820> bunch<00:05:57.300> of<00:05:57.419> them<00:05:57.539> he<00:05:57.660> got<00:05:57.780> a

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
see that he has a bunch of them he got a

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.990 
see that he has a bunch of them he got a
bunch<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.140> new<00:05:58.289> stuff<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.340> main<00:05:59.610> one<00:05:59.820> is

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
bunch of new stuff and the main one is

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.029 
bunch of new stuff and the main one is
that<00:06:00.180> he<00:06:00.300> no<00:06:00.419> longer<00:06:00.539> has<00:06:00.840> his<00:06:00.870> kunai<00:06:01.289> right<00:06:01.500> so

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
that he no longer has his kunai right so

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.110 
that he no longer has his kunai right so
now<00:06:02.160> he<00:06:02.220> has<00:06:02.430> far<00:06:02.870> medium<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.169> close<00:06:05.120> blade

unique<00:07:24.050> so<00:07:24.589> if<00:07:24.830> you're<00:07:25.009> more<00:07:25.159> used<00:07:25.430> to<00:07:25.550> the<00:07:25.849> you

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:26.119 
unique so if you're more used to the you

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:28.449 
unique so if you're more used to the you
know<00:07:26.209> Lasher<00:07:26.749> and<00:07:26.959> his<00:07:27.499> other<00:07:27.740> stands<00:07:28.219> or

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
other variation then this one's gonna be

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:31.600 
other variation then this one's gonna be
a<00:07:30.289> little<00:07:30.529> bit<00:07:30.619> harder<00:07:30.830> to<00:07:30.919> pick<00:07:31.069> up<00:07:31.189> on<00:07:31.369> right

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
a little bit harder to pick up on right

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.939 
a little bit harder to pick up on right
but<00:07:32.149> it's<00:07:32.330> pretty<00:07:32.539> unique<00:07:32.809> and<00:07:33.050> it's<00:07:33.289> it's<00:07:33.740> fun

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:33.949 
but it's pretty unique and it's it's fun

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:35.379 
but it's pretty unique and it's it's fun
to<00:07:34.039> mess<00:07:34.129> around<00:07:34.249> with<00:07:34.459> for<00:07:34.699> sure<00:07:34.729> so<00:07:35.089> this<00:07:35.240> is

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:35.389 
to mess around with for sure so this is

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:37.059 
to mess around with for sure so this is
