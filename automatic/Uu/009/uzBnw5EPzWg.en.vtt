Hi everyone! This is Yukiko Sugiyama.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.420
Today I'm going to introduce the top 5 of my best beauty products 2014.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600
Last year, bold black eye lines and false lashes were in trend,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.080
but this year, more natural brown kind of makeup were in trend, I think.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:33.293
No.5 is...

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
face color palette by IPSA.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.900
I like this very much because it is so useful that I can create my own color. 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.040
For me, this beige and brown is for shading,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.660
orange is for cheek blush,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.760
and this light purple is for highlighter.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.580
The most heavy-using color must be this brown.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.180
This color can also be used as eye shadow base, or nose shadow.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.320
Please try this palette.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
No.4 is...

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.140
Two of these.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.940
Brown color eye shadow palette "Three Dimensional Eyes" by Lunasol,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.620
and, "Pressed Pigment" by MAC.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.100
These are also very very useful.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760
I use this one for eye shadow base.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.360
This shimmery gorgeous color makes my skin brighter.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.040
Next is this palette.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.740
Can you see these gradation color on the left top and the bottom right?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.140
There are many slightly different browns.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.260
So, you can do delicate eye makeup.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.480
Also, there is a choice of glitter and non-glitter.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.320
It can be used for all kind of makeups.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.960
Then No.3 is...

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.800
foundation brush by Shiseido.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.100
When a makeup artist first used this for me,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620
I fell in love with its softness.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.540
It's really good for my sensitive skin.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.060
When applying foundation, I use this brush like drawing circles.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.780
In this way, the skin will get natural and flawless.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.340
I basically use it for liquid foundation,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.420
but it really works with powder foundation as well.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.900
Finishing with this brush, your skin will get more shine.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.620
No.2 is...

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.340
"Creative Concealer" by IPSA.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.360
Actually I often get acne, and this always helps me hide them.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.960
The important point is that it has 3 different colors.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.640
You can mix these color by yourself, and make it fit your skin.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.240
I've used stick concealer before, 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.800
but it was too hard for me.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.760
On the contrast, this cream type concealer makes your skin natural.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.260
At last, my favorite beauty products of 2014,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.060
No.1 is...

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.540
"Liquid Last Liner" by MAC.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.280
This is absolutely my favorite.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280
I've repeated twice.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280
Please have a look.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.080
It might look like a ordinary liquid liner, but it's different.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.880
Very easy to draw and long-lasting.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.480
I hope you try my favorite eye liner!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.900
That's all for my best beauty products 2014.
