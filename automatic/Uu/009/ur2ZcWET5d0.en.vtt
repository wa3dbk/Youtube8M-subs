00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.409
 so now the moment you are 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.899
 do you do another twitch 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.969

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:53.840
 up if you pull back now 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.039
 and you need to pull it vertically up at 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:03.380

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.860
 Further look to when he goes for 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.650
 a piece that the leash sagged only then 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.900
