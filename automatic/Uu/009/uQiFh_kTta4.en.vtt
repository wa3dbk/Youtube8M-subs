00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.900
 we already have the beta of the 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.900
 new god 7 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.000
 as we can see on the screen 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
 blocking 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.550
 highlights the wallpaper about the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.680
 hour lasts very little as you can see 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.680
 we slide and put the code 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.210
 This is the home screen 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.619
 with the famous changes of the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 icons 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.390
 a more simple minimalist design 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.610
 the shines disappear 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.770
 and with the new windows of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.270
 notifications 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.780
 where we can access the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.219
 lost notifications 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.219
 to all of today 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 and the most important thing to the new control 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 panel 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.489
 from here we can adjust the brightness of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.489
 the screen to put the airplane mode 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 and manage the networks 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.430
 but all 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.430
 and even he and everyone 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 we also see that some accesses appear 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.189
 direct that can not be edited yet 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.990
 let's hope that the final version of them 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.780
 7 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.210
 this can be corrected we have access to 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.619
 the flashlight to the alarms to the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.619
 calculator and the camera 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.430
 the menus as we can see for example 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 in the photos have been made very 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.930
 minimalist 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.370
 we have the options of the trees we 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.630
 appear panoramas and videos 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.630
 separated from the reel itself 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.600
 in the adjustments we see the new typography 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.530
 the center's options 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 control center notifications 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.500
 as in the previous version of them 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.870
 the new folders right now not the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.530
 We have full but we promise you that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.720
 you can pass the screen by undoing like this 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.110
 the previous limit two applications per 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.110
 binder 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.950
 and another of the things that you liked so much 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 is to be multitasking 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.140
 Many will sound from other systems 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140
 operational 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.889
 in which you miss some small 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.189
 button with which to close all the 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.189
 Applications
