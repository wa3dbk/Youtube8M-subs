00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.510 
get it done of my fingers my only
concern<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.300> UV<00:02:52.720> light<00:02:53.020> box<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.830> had<00:02:54.370> seen

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
concern is the UV light box I had seen

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.680 
concern is the UV light box I had seen
on<00:02:54.700> dermtv.com<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.740> YouTube<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.330> fact

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
on dermtv.com here on YouTube the fact

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.190 
on dermtv.com here on YouTube the fact
that<00:02:59.370> skin<00:03:00.370> cancer<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.240> people's<00:03:01.660> hands<00:03:01.960> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that skin cancer in people's hands and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.320 
that skin cancer in people's hands and
feet<00:03:02.440> has<00:03:02.650> risen<00:03:02.980> dramatically<00:03:03.700> since<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
feet has risen dramatically since the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.500 
feet has risen dramatically since the
use<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.480> those<00:03:04.840> UV<00:03:05.230> light<00:03:05.410> boxes<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.390> think

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
use of those UV light boxes so I think

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.440 
use of those UV light boxes so I think
if<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.470> continue<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.040> do<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.520> nail<00:03:09.880> treatment

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
if I continue to do that nail treatment

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.540 
if I continue to do that nail treatment
I<00:03:10.600> will<00:03:10.990> take<00:03:11.320> some<00:03:11.530> sunscreen<00:03:12.100> along<00:03:12.370> and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
I will take some sunscreen along and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.130 
I will take some sunscreen along and
make<00:03:12.670> sure<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> put<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.570> my<00:03:13.690> hands<00:03:14.110> and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
make sure that I put it on my hands and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.530 
make sure that I put it on my hands and
my<00:03:14.470> feet<00:03:14.740> before<00:03:15.460> they<00:03:15.790> go<00:03:15.940> under<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.360> light

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
my feet before they go under the light

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.560 
my feet before they go under the light
box<00:03:18.600> let's<00:03:19.600> see<00:03:20.070> but<00:03:21.070> anyway<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.760> got<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
box let's see but anyway I got it in a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.170 
box let's see but anyway I got it in a
real<00:03:22.750> pretty<00:03:23.020> kind<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.010> berry<00:03:24.250> color<00:03:24.610> pin

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
real pretty kind of a berry color pin

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.240 
real pretty kind of a berry color pin
berry<00:03:25.540> color<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.770> put<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.010> base

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
berry color and so they put the base

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.170 
berry color and so they put the base
coat<00:03:27.550> on<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.240> then<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.670> think<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.790> between<00:03:31.150> each

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
coat on and then I think in between each

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.820 
coat on and then I think in between each
coat<00:03:31.570> they<00:03:31.780> put<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.050> feet<00:03:32.260> under<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.650> UV

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
coat they put your feet under the UV

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.010 
coat they put your feet under the UV
