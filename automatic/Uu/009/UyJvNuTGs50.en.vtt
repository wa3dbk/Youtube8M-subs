00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
functions so let's say you just want

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.090 
functions so let's say you just want
your<00:00:31.470> tea<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:34.110> want<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.410> chanting<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.980> be

anywhere<00:01:59.390> right<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> hole<00:02:01.460> not<00:02:02.460> really

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
anywhere right in the hole not really

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.300 
anywhere right in the hole not really
there<00:02:04.680> goes<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> lava<00:02:06.080> that's<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.350> flowing

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there goes the lava that's the flowing

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.259 
there goes the lava that's the flowing
that's<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> flow<00:02:08.940> stop<00:02:09.239> mechanic<00:02:09.780> um<00:02:12.650> yeah<00:02:13.650> um

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
that's the flow stop mechanic um yeah um

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.650 
that's the flow stop mechanic um yeah um
the<00:02:15.269> reason<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.440> can't<00:02:16.680> stop

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
the reason for that is I can't stop

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.330 
the reason for that is I can't stop
players<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:18.900> doing<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:19.860> i<00:02:20.130> don't

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
players from doing that because i don't

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.460 
players from doing that because i don't
know<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.640> event<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.300> yet<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.580 
know the event for that yet in the
future<00:02:22.680> i<00:02:23.069> plan<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:25.170> is
