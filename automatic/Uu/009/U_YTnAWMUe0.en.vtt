the asus g75vw need to know down there

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
the asus g75vw need to know down there
so<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.100> game<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.580> running<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.390> about<00:00:24.480> 30<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.170> 40

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so the game is running at about 30 to 40

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
so the game is running at about 30 to 40
frames<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:26.039> medium<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.789> 1080p<00:00:27.920> which<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.070> which

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
frames or medium at 1080p which is which

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
frames or medium at 1080p which is which
is<00:00:29.519> acceptable<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> game<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.349> my

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is acceptable for a game but in my

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
is acceptable for a game but in my
opinion<00:00:31.619> um<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.610> first-person<00:00:33.300> shooter<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
opinion um a first-person shooter has to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
opinion um a first-person shooter has to
be<00:00:34.500> running<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.640> 50<00:00:36.120> frames<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
be running at about 50 frames for a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.740 
be running at about 50 frames for a
decent<00:00:36.960> experience<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.160> opinion

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
decent experience that's just my opinion

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.420 
decent experience that's just my opinion
but<00:00:39.750> yeah<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:40.410> hope<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> performance

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
but yeah let's hope that the performance

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
but yeah let's hope that the performance
will<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.760> improved<00:00:42.360> once<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.170> full<00:00:43.530> game

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

battlefield<00:00:48.329> 4<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.020> plays<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.950> like

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
battlefield 4 it plays pretty much like

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.389 
battlefield 4 it plays pretty much like
its<00:00:50.520> predecessor<00:00:51.210> um<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> course<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
its predecessor um you of course have to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
its predecessor um you of course have to
do<00:00:53.579> weapons<00:00:54.059> better<00:00:54.360> graphics<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
do weapons better graphics and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.670 
do weapons better graphics and
animations<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.930> me<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.140> changes

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
animations but to me these changes

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
animations but to me these changes
aren't<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.370> big<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.270> thought<00:01:00.449> they'll<00:01:00.660> be

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
aren't as big as I thought they'll be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
aren't as big as I thought they'll be
one<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.579> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
one thing that I really like about this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
one thing that I really like about this
game<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.199> play<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> 64

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
game is that you can play with up to 64

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
game is that you can play with up to 64
players<00:01:05.760> which<00:01:06.090> forced<00:01:06.689> results<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> pretty

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
players which forced results in a pretty

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.789 
players which forced results in a pretty
massive<00:01:08.220> battle<00:01:08.880> um<00:01:09.260> yeah<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.560> I'm

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
about 30 to 35 frames which is which is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.719 
about 30 to 35 frames which is which is
no<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.360> okay<00:01:30.780> um<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.400> am<00:01:32.549> using

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
no it's it's okay um and i am using

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
no it's it's okay um and i am using
dxtory<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> wanted<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.320> that

dxtory if you wanted to know that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
dxtory if you wanted to know that
because<00:01:34.860> perhaps<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.909> drops<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> frame

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
because perhaps just drops the frame

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.289 
because perhaps just drops the frame
rate<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:36.869> way<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.829> i<00:01:38.040> chose<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.909> using
