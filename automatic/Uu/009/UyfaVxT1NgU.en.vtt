00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
because it's going to be the first night

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.350 
because it's going to be the first night
race<00:01:59.780> in<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.770> Goodyear<00:02:01.100> Cup<00:02:01.340> Series<00:02:01.640> I've

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
race in the Goodyear Cup Series I've

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.670 
race in the Goodyear Cup Series I've
been<00:02:02.540> experimenting<00:02:03.050> with<00:02:03.320> some<00:02:03.470> lighting

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
been experimenting with some lighting

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.499 
been experimenting with some lighting
setups<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.659> I've<00:02:05.659> found<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.520> know<00:02:07.549> it's

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
setups and I've found that you know it's

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.969 
setups and I've found that you know it's
all<00:02:08.660> artificial<00:02:09.050> lighting<00:02:09.440> because<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:09.860> all

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
all artificial lighting because it's all

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.479 
all artificial lighting because it's all
inside<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:11.180> it's<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.170> lot<00:02:12.319> easier<00:02:12.590> to

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
inside but it's it's a lot easier to

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.449 
inside but it's it's a lot easier to
believe<00:02:13.840> artificial<00:02:14.840> lighting<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.530> sunlight

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
believe artificial lighting is sunlight

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.430 
believe artificial lighting is sunlight
than<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.450> believe<00:02:17.600> artificial

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
than it is to believe artificial

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.890 
than it is to believe artificial
lighting<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:19.040> artificial<00:02:19.970> lighting<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.870> I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
lighting is artificial lighting but I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.110 
lighting is artificial lighting but I
played<00:02:21.320> around<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.769> some<00:02:21.920> setups<00:02:22.489> I've<00:02:22.730> got

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
played around with some setups I've got

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.860 
played around with some setups I've got
it<00:02:23.239> looking<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:24.820> as<00:02:25.820> it's<00:02:26.450> really

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
it looking really good as it's really

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.729 
it looking really good as it's really
convincing<00:02:27.830> as<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.970> night<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.780> Richmond

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
convincing as it's night and Richmond

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.770 
convincing as it's night and Richmond
has<00:02:30.920> been<00:02:31.130> artificially<00:02:31.489> lit<00:02:32.150> by<00:02:32.450> its<00:02:32.630> own

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
has been artificially lit by its own

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.809 
has been artificially lit by its own
stadium<00:02:33.080> lights<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.280> that's<00:02:34.459> going<00:02:34.700> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
stadium lights and so that's going to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.580 
stadium lights and so that's going to
