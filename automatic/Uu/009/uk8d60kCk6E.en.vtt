authenticate<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:39.240> product<00:03:39.780> using<00:03:40.500> this

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
authenticate the product using this

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.449 
authenticate the product using this
serial<00:03:41.730> number<00:03:42.410> just<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> make<00:03:43.650> sure<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:44.130> we

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
serial number just to make sure that we

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.699 
serial number just to make sure that we
don't<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:44.850> some<00:03:45.180> other<00:03:45.810> companies<00:03:46.380> that's

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
don't have some other companies that's

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.380

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
faking the product and we have fake

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.910 
faking the product and we have fake
products<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:48.989> capture<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.709> code

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
products and you capture with this code

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.550 
products and you capture with this code
you<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.280> go<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.489> original<00:03:51.330> speaking<00:03:51.930> com<00:03:52.290> use

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
you can go to original speaking com use

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.199 
you can go to original speaking com use
this<00:03:52.709> code<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.610> should<00:03:53.820> also<00:03:53.970> get

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
this code and it should also get

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.660 
this code and it should also get
authenticate<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.980> your<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.640> your

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
authenticate so your this is your

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.010 
authenticate so your this is your
authentication<00:03:57.480> seal<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.620> approval<00:03:58.770> or<00:04:00.020> seal

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
authentication seal of approval or seal

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.920 
authentication seal of approval or seal
basically<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.640> with<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.390> let's<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.900> ahead

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
basically so with that let's go ahead

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.870 
basically so with that let's go ahead
