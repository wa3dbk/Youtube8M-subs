 Hello everyone and yesterday it showed us 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.390
 new watch called apple watch 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:28.750
 let's see what we have there 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:30.669
 screwed first probably worth it 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.860
 note that often are square 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.710
 I think so and so it was obvious but suddenly 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.270
 someone was waiting for a round design hours 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.579
 not distinguished but here the taste and color 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.010
 I personally like more recently 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.110
 presented elji ji watch now 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.880
 yappau is not all that bad just probably 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.020
 didn't want to go anywhere much and 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.180
 We made so that it went all the time 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.460
 I went about the design and the wheels on the side need 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.320
 mention serves but to zoom 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.420
 interface in the system by the way about 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.460
 system interface it represents 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.590
 many round races which by the way 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.659
 speaking quite original and pretty 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.490
 Looks the same screen now responds 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.100
 on the force of pressing which is pretty cool 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.170
 We go further as I understand it there are hours 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.229
 voice control and of course syria 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.939
 and by the way there is vibration also the clock has 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.770
 wireless charging that's quite self 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.929
 logical and convenient battery you are small 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.479
 from at least one extra connector just yet 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.409
 the design also has a lot of sensors and watches 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.179
 not surprising 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.189
 health and sport at the presentation was 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.689
 said a lot now watch with the words apple 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.450
 health and whole day 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.609
 motivates you to play sports and to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.719
 work with devices only starting from 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.090
 iphone 5 above 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.429
 now pro and official bags 6 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.289
 possibly complement and by itself third-party 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.090
 manufacturers have burn so do on 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.009
 rivet tuev bunch of straps for this 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.049
 Watch watches are available in two sizes. 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.240
 one is bigger and the other is smaller 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.749
 all the difference is all to all 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.749
 Thank you for watching 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:02:00.909
