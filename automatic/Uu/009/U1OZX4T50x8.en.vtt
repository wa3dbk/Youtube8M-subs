00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.980 
it's the reality of things I never
thought<00:06:46.060> I<00:06:46.330> would<00:06:47.140> be<00:06:47.260> playing<00:06:47.530> this<00:06:47.740> long

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
thought I would be playing this long

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.230 
thought I would be playing this long
when<00:06:49.990> we<00:06:50.050> made<00:06:50.320> my<00:06:50.530> last<00:06:50.710> contract<00:06:51.250> ice<00:06:51.580> you

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
when we made my last contract ice you

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.930 
when we made my last contract ice you
know<00:06:53.040> everything<00:06:54.040> I<00:06:54.160> put<00:06:54.400> my<00:06:54.520> family<00:06:54.730> through

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
know everything I put my family through

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
know everything I put my family through
so<00:06:55.600> many<00:06:55.780> years<00:06:56.080> I<00:06:57.060> didn't<00:06:58.060> think<00:06:58.210> that<00:07:00.960> this

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
so many years I didn't think that this

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.090 
so many years I didn't think that this
would<00:07:02.140> continue<00:07:02.410> so<00:07:06.720> but<00:07:07.720> I<00:07:07.960> still<00:07:08.770> love<00:07:08.950> the

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
would continue so but I still love the

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:18.930 
would continue so but I still love the
game<00:07:09.250> I<00:07:14.220> watch<00:07:15.220> keep<00:07:15.400> playing<00:07:15.690> that's<00:07:16.690> it
