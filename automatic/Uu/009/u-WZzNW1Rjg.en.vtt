00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello guys with you dork and today 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.049
 I'll show you a funny mod for minecraft 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 and he adds weapons that in childhood 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.539
 was each and for his craft you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.699
 you only need two boards and 5 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.949
 pieces of skin lay out on their workbench 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.320
 will have this way and get 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.960
 What do you think? What do you get? 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 slingshot don't know how about modern 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 children but my childhood was a slingshot 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 and no where did I do it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
 independently in itself slingshot 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.730
 useless because the need for it and cartridges 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.260
 cartridges crafted from cobblestones to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 to craft a cartridge of cobblestones to you 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.940
 will have to put it on the workbench 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 one cobblestone in the middle and you get 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 16 rounds so do as much as possible 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.750
 half a ton cartridges will be enough 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 and get down to shooting so we need 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.969
 find a suitable target so i guess crowe 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 fit the cow is now 10 points 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 health and we'll see how much 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.400
 health removes slingshot let's direct 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 on it and click the right mouse button and how 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.860
 you see shoots by as many as five points 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 health is 5 whole hearts 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 let's finish the cow and all of us 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 it took her two shots let's 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 try to shoot out in that cow 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.689
 which is very far aha 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.030
 here you need to aim physics 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.840
 shooting is different than shooting 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 from bow 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.439
 so you do not have to direct here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.369
 this top you just need to enter 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.070
 crosshair right on your target and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.920
 shoot that I can not get it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 finish off because she is hiding in the bushes 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.270
 let's go find her 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270
 and finish 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.460
 the rate of fire of this question is very 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.650
 high what's wrong with me 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.710
 because to shoot a slingshot 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.940
 you need a lot of time 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.620
 so small and pretty 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.320
 we had an interesting mod today 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.030
 Well this actually all around
