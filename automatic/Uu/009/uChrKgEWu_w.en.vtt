00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:01.908
 Hello, everyone~ I am chocolate. 

00:00:01.977 --> 00:00:03.474
 I want to introduce to you today. 

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:04.457
 XOR gate 

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:06.148
 So what is the XOR gate? 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.862
 XOR gates are actually things that we often see in our lives... 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.948
 I will turn it into night. 

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:13.382
 it is good 

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.554
 Usually it will be like this 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.468
 There is a light here 

00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:18.902
 Then this switch can control this light 

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:20.900
 Then at the top of the stairs 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.788
 Of course there is another switch 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.411
 Can control the same lamp 

00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:25.097
 that... 

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:27.245
 If the above is executed... 

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.348
 Open action 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.331
 For example, like this 

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:33.668
 Downstairs, it's natural... it will turn off 

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:36.308
 In the same way, if I was driving downstairs 

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:37.565
 That upstairs 

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:38.937
 It will become off 

00:00:39.588 --> 00:00:41.154
 These two are not in conflict with each other. 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.657
 What is used in this is the XOR gate. 

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:46.034
 In the example just now 

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.782
 Two switches, simultaneously controlling the same xenon lamp 

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:50.422
 that... 

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:52.480
 In the end result 

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:55.611
 As long as the two switches are in phase 

00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:56.571
 Then it is off 

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:57.942
 For example, like this 

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.434
 As long as the two are in phase, it is off 

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:01.531
 Just reverse 

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:02.262
 Is on 

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.205
 This is open 

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:05.920
 This is also open 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.348
 As long as it is inverted, it is on 

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.457
 OK, that's the most intuitive idea 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.251
 May just put two switches directly 

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.422
 Both point to the same... 

00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:15.165
 light 

00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:16.560
 That's it? 

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:19.051
 These two switches are indeed independent 

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:20.000
 but 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.142
 When one side is open 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.085
 On the other side, there is no way to execute... 

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:24.285
 The action to turn it off 

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:26.685
 So, we have to make some changes. 

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:27.382
 that... 

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.177
 In terms of the final result 

00:01:29.382 --> 00:01:31.170
 These two...the biggest difficulty points 

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.457
 It should be... 

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.462
 These two... at the same time... when opening 

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:37.460
 The final output is the result. 

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:38.194
 that... 

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:40.274
 We...just look at one side first. 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.582
 That is... 

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:42.262
 This lamp and... 

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:44.742
 This...this half of a switch 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.988
 Here... 

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:47.005
 Is open 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.502
 But the result we hope is off 

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:50.500
 So this... will definitely be used 

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:51.691
 NOT gate 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.462
 So, let’s look at the unilateral first. 

00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:55.680
 Inside the single... 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.371
 We need to use NOT gate 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.182
 So 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.342
 Like this, you can 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.422
 But after using NOT gate 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.045
 Our initial operation 

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.040
 Maybe... the answer is already the opposite, right? 

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:06.845
 and so... 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.182
 Nothing wrong, we need to use two NOT gates in total. 

00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:10.914
 like this 

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:15.840
 This way 

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:17.645
 We are not only useful to NOT gate 

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:19.640
 Then our unilateral operation also... 

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:20.685
 No opposite 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.268
 That is... 

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.800
 When it is closed, it is off. 

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.091
 Open when you open 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.960
 So 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.634
 The simple way is that we put these two sides 

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.131
 Changed to... 

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.942
 Two NOT gate connections 

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:32.662
 like this 

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:39.394
 OK~ 

00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:40.308
 like this 

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:42.342
 That's it... 

00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:44.080
 Thus 

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:46.205
 The switch here is not affected 

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.697
 The switch here is also... normal 

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.988
 Next we just let... 

00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:52.091
 When these two are pressed 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.154
 The output is off 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.091
 This way you can 

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:55.028
 that... 

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:56.548
 Want to make it off 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.982
 It is necessary to extinguish both torches at the same time 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.674
 These two torches are extinguished 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.817
 We just have to be here 

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.262
 Put another redstone torch 

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:06.260
 and then 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.857
 Put... 

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:07.782
 it... 

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:09.428
 Enter into both 

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:11.177
 This way it can be off 

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:12.914
 But this torch 

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:14.685
 Usually can't work 

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.520
 Only when both of them are pressed 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.857
 It can work 

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:19.920
 and so 

00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:21.280
 Our approach 

00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:22.365
 It’s like this 

00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:24.360
 Put a redstone torch here 

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.611
 This redstone torch 

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:29.451
 Usually... is being... 

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:32.754
 These two... 

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:34.091
 like this 

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:35.897
 and then 

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:36.868
 This torch 

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:38.114
 Again... right... 

00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:39.942
 These two lines are output 

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.360
 Both are entered into these torches 

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:42.125
 This way you can 

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:43.954
 and so 

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:45.565
 In normal times 

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.062
 Go away from x3 

00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.508
 In normal times 

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:51.500
 This torch is useless. 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.851
 Because it was hit by these two redstones... 

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:55.177
 give... 

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:56.662
 Suppressed 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.394
 that... 

00:03:57.977 --> 00:03:58.377
 Go away 

00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.542
 Go ~ open 

00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:01.702
 That today 

00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:02.457
 This... 

00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:04.308
 Both sides of the switch 

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:06.537
 Usually it works independently and is normal. 

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:09.748
 Until it is pressed on both sides 

00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:11.680
 This suppression signal has disappeared 

00:04:11.782 --> 00:04:12.834
 Because the torch is extinguished 

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.388
 So the suppression signal disappears 

00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:15.302
 This will light up 

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.211
 Then replace these two redstone torches 

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:19.794
 Put the last light... 

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:22.148
 So this is a simple XOR threshold~ 

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:25.531
 Then, it’s the part of the circuit that is streamlined. 

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:26.708
 Actually 

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:29.668
 The circuit does not need to be so complicated 

00:04:29.954 --> 00:04:31.782
 Signal input point, these two 

00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:34.102
 and then 

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:35.268
 NOT gate 

00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.260
 Actually the distance is very very close 

00:04:37.508 --> 00:04:38.582
 Just be here. 

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:39.737
 Distance 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.982
 I can put it here. 

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:41.942
 like this 

00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:44.685
 and then 

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:46.411
 This signal suppresses it 

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:48.022
 like this 

00:04:48.674 --> 00:04:50.160
 Then put a here... 

00:04:50.834 --> 00:04:52.160
 The last redstone torch 

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:56.365
 How does this Redstone torch suppress this redstone torch? 

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:57.600
 We are using... 

00:04:57.771 --> 00:05:00.034
 Charge up this principle 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 As long as this charges it up 

00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:02.822
 then 

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:04.480
 Put redstone here 

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:06.765
 It can suppress this redstone torch 

00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:08.240
 So of course, the same is true here. 

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.600
 Finally, our signal output point is here 

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.845
 So the blue is the signal output point. 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.142
 Red is the signal input point 

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.160
 So this way 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160
 Completed a simple NOT gate啰 (spoken error: XOR gate) 

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:23.245
 Ok, both sides are open 

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:24.068
 It will turn off 

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:25.508
 This is a simple... 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.234
 simple 

00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:28.080
 XOR threshold 

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.085
 Ok, that... there is another version of XOR gate. 

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:33.680
 It is like this 

00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:36.800
 Here, a switch 

00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:37.782
哎唷

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.497
 There is a switch here 

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:42.480
 This switch, at the same time output two signals 

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:43.211
 like this 

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:45.611
 Then put a redstone torch here. 

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:47.234
 that... 

00:05:47.657 --> 00:05:48.605
 This switch 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.125
 Between on and off 

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:52.388
 Will let these two signals here... do switching 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.891
 It will lose... independently output two different routes 

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:55.977
 Different signals 

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:56.811
 that... 

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.257
 This switch will control which side it will run out to. 

00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:03.250
 and then 

00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:04.274
 We are here... 

00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:06.080
 Put a square to make it charge 

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:08.537
 This square 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.897
 At the same time being another... 

00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.657
 Viscous piston to push 

00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:15.142
 That sticky... sex... this sticky piston? 

00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:17.140
 Also by another 

00:06:17.554 --> 00:06:18.148
 switch 

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:19.371
 Controlled 

00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:22.080
 So, this switch here 

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:24.137
 can do... 

00:06:24.788 --> 00:06:26.594
 Signal switching on both sides 

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:29.131
 Also this switch 

00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:31.862
 It will be responsible for putting this white square 

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:33.062
 Shift left and right 

00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:35.060
 So you can also control the output of the signal. 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.177
 Ok, then we will... 

00:06:37.462 --> 00:06:39.085
 The final output point is here. 

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:39.771
 like this 

00:06:44.502 --> 00:06:46.777
 Usually it is... when it is extinguished 

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:48.770
 Open this switch 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.822
 Because the signal will jump to the other side 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.885
 Then recharge 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.788
 So it will light up 

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:55.062
 That's here? 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.268
 When opened 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.485
 Will push this white square here 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.880
 Then the same, charging 

00:07:00.948 --> 00:07:01.657
 It will... 

00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:02.731
 Light up 

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:05.337
 When the two sides are pressed at the same time 

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:06.994
 This signal will cut to the other side. 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.125
 Then nothing is charging 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.314
 So it won't shine 

00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:10.331
 So 

00:07:10.365 --> 00:07:11.748
 This is also a simple 

00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:12.960
 XOR threshold 

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:16.342
 That's two simple... XOR gates
