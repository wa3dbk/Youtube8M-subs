00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.069
 so installing a backup radar 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.509
 on a dacia sandero stepway in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.500
 the occurrence but it works 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 also on the sandero 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.599
 so here we go with a basic kit to 36 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 euros found on ebay with the sensors 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.300
 on the left the central but also 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.519
 connect a screen if necessary it is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 four sensors there a user manual that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 explains a the the necessary material 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.510
 for installation 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 it's pretty cool already we remove the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.180
 nightlight of trunk we went quickly 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.180
 removed on the battery 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 then we eclyp the carpet we do 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.950
 be careful not to damage them too much 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 but hey it's plastic have some 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 also clip on the right side at 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.070
 level of the right rear light to remove 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 the rugs 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 you see we do not name the damage 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 quickly it's not super 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.129
 quality must be careful 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.129
 then we unplug the taillight 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.770
 this simple next here is the screw for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.880
 the dvi do not know what will be needed 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 davis and the taillight we see that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 above it is still plugged so well 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 be careful that this is outside 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.500
 of the car when we raise the fire 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.729
 back there is a kind of little girl 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 en bloc that must not be lost 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.189
 so that's what it gives once the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.080
 carpet remove a cycle taillights so 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 seen from the outside there we stuck the terminal 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.770
 on the bumper to indicate the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 positions we're going to make holes in them 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 sensors are positioning them a little 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 as we can there are so many 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.729
 methods we take landmarks and we 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.159
 try to put them on the same line 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.270
 a pope on the ground then we started brother 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.829
 a loan too quietly safe 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.119
 to avoid attacking directly with 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.759
 lou which also provided in the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.860
 box we go slowly gently what 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.039
 it's a plastic that avoids them and 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.840
 clape and then also directly or through 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.599
 above the tape this is what it gives 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.420
 it's relatively clean we'll see it 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.519
 afterwards you see that remains that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.700
 stay clean enough when you go 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.700
 slowly 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.030
 so we did the four holes we did 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.400
 removed the meal back light we're going 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.840
 pass the cables but we also go there 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.590
 went inside the bumper 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.590
 so here we slide in introduces a guide 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.000
 through the hole through one of the holes and years 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.890
 we then recover from underneath 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 pretty easy by the way nothing hours she 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.540
 disassembled have passed the cables on 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.959
 not necessarily easy to access 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.060
 but hey we can do it here I have 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.980
 recovered with two fingers and that's me 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.280
 allows to pass them to the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.519
 left to the so we're going back 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.700
 cables as much as possible and we 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.799
 so get the guide here at the exit 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.170
 of the right rear light that was removed for 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.970
 the opportunity and we will recover all 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.680
 cables there and it's not equally 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.079
 so we recover the injured cases 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 also by that we will go into 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.940
 the car 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.440
 plus there is a small hole that allows us 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.150
 to go directly into the trunk 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:30.370
 without doing too much you see it comes in 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 correctly and it's pretty simple so 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.760
 there then we put the sensors must 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.470
 there is a little rubber that allows 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.459
 well block them so we turn them 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.400
 slightly introducing them what is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.290
 and then as there is a little game and my 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.730
 sisters it protects what we had 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.549
 stinking tuellement lit so there is 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.950
 picks up the sensor collectors 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.129
 with their covers that we will connect 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.129
 on the central everything is indicated on 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.260
 left the right so there actually I 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.709
 do a little video to find out 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.569
 how to disassemble the winder protector from 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.709
 rear waistband of which there are three screws to 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.970
 dismantle that's just my opinion 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.060
 good we will not demonstrate a 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.070
 dozens of times what so 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.660
 then we tea clipse we hold a 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.030
 little bit on the seal slightly and has 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.630
 frankly not much to do 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.759
 the eclyps of the bodywork and June 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.099
 we pay attention to clip eclipse in 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.039
 plastic that can break as well 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:40.180
 that take a little bit because there is 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:43.240
 This is canned and by species of 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.280
 little screw heads and so that's it 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.720
 will pass the wiring per year 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.120
 to actually go into the little high 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.650
 that there is above the damper where 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.780
 we will put there the case of the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.610
 central so there we go all 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.229
 sensors 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.510
 we can see the solidarity for not 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.199
 that they especially do not touch the 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.000
 back belt that do not harm 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.820
 the proper functioning of the belt 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.130
 back then so here we'll cut the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.870
 mass and the reverse to be able to 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.760
 connect the control unit to 1 for 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.830
 that they can beep and then we put 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.900
 a domino so on the black film mass 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.210
 and on the beige thread on which 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.340
 look at the black film is the red thread of 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.770
 the central and then one of the chatterton 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.510
 we do something clean so that 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.370
 that but good - electricity I'm not 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.400
 very talented so then the cables have 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.169
 the solidarises with collars 1 and we 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.539
 try the high of the island of the 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.590
 solidarize as much as possible so we put 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.150
 necklaces also in water 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.070
 underneath the rewinder for easter 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.110
 cables move we have it everywhere for 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.330
 that the cables do not move at all but 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.870
 it is also to solidariser the central 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.630
 with a screw against the aluminum wall 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.590
 so there the central is well 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.450
 protected well hidden we can to mount 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.850
 correctly and we leave on the other hand 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.280
 past 1 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.460
 the piper that remains that he can stay 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.200
 accessible when your pallet the seat 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.360
 rear for oneself the coupe is diminishing 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.000
 the noise you see they are 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.620
 accessible so pass the cable in 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.560
 underneath the protection the protection of a 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.260
 reel it's pretty simple so here 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.100
 there are three positions and one weak 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.720
 effort for that but good so that's it 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100
 the final result I hope it has you 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.570
 and you're going 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.830
 install this little thing that mow 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.830
 frankly practical to use
