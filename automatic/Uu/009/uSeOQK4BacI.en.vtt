00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hello, good afternoon everyone, I'm 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.000
 luis carlos rodrÃ­guez de sant mexico in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.519
 a new tutorial really I wanted 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 upload previous videos but last as two 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 years or a year and a half without uploading a video 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 those are for personal reasons 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.880
 but unfortunately I could not 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.680
 upload them but I can already say so 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.510
 we have been needed because now I can 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 be recording a video for you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.130
 come out in this song this time 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.199
 let's go to teach them to play the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 song of in your light of the spirit and in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 truth is a song of praise very 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 pretty and very indicated that so I'm going to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 start with the chords 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 It takes a liter that with the guitar 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.320
 a sound this time I'm not going to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 teach what that would be that intra the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 electric guitar but if you would like 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.239
 that they will be taught to you please here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 in the comments have to protect me not 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.030
 I'm going to be aware of how good the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.880
 Intro starts with my food 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.100
 yes 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.789
 for those who are not positioning this 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:18.369
 level we are simply going to list the 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:22.439
 fingers 1 to 4 1 2 3 and 4 fingers if the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.770
 number one goes on the seventh fret 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.770
 fifth string 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 yes in the seventh lieutenant agreement that the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.229
 third to the second do not use this or from here 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.150
 we're going we're going the third finger in the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 ninth fret 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.810
 fourth rope yes and the fourth finger that is 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.720
 this one let's start we put it in the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.350
 ninth after stewart third rope and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.070
 together are areas and I'm using these 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.460
 three fingers 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.909
 these three fingers 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.909
 yes 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.550
 creates 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.690
 but 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.849
 so here 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.849
 let's see yes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.360
 if it is a contrast of the store saves to 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:37.220
 leaving like I want to touch is not the same 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.220
 that my nothing but in the second 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.900
 C sharp minor 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:50.860
 in the fourth fret like the one in the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.860
 position 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.170
 we just remove this from here 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.480
 so the sound of the wind begins 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 What is it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.459
 here 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.270
 what is there is the intro 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270
 Yes Yes 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 two avenues 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.680
 and if ok will do so at a speed 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.940
 a slow speed so they can 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.120
 follow me so I just strum 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.120
 is 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.400
 ok down up 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 for me 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.100
 How are you 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.190
 i 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.860
 ok is the radio to be learned by 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:08.920
 repeat several followed so that they arrive 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.920
 the movement with the hand and they are areas and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.450
 and then we started with the intro 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.010
 i 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.220
 and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.490
 all right 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.410
 God 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.050
 this is the verse the first one is action 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.600
 the sounds for your lost love feel 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.600
 where the first 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.600
 and again and more to start over 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:06.180
 dazzles nothing in this world 72 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.180
 i 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.180
 to nobody 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.610
 you are welcome 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:31.409
 I have been sustained yes no 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.729
 then that step is 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.860
 I arrive 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.699
 you 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.699
 I tell him 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:47.409
 and it is repeated or that is played twice 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:51.689
 and I'm going to start the color 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.689
 the record is the same as it is going to be 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.419
 why 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.419
 slow 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.400
 all right 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.820
 when I have had 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.820
 i 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:18.770
 and those are all the chords that go in 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.340
 the song I think I think there's a 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.979
 piece that instead of starting with yes 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.690
 it starts when sustained but as I eat 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.449
 you like without even initial 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.639
 has been with the one of step of the century or 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.870
 you will see that step there if they have 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.930
 some doubt you already know 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.130
 ask me in the comments on my 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.110
 facebook page that will be 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.180
 appearing here or else in the 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.099
 description of the video I will leave it for 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.259
 please thank you very much in the former 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.320
 write to my favorite channel share 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.750
 I would appreciate too much a brief thing 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.580
 what he wants to say is that they forgive me 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.849
 for not uploading a video 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.590
 they have continued to fail can say is 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.050
 I did well because I really want 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.889
 to upload videos but good is necessary 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.129
 that we can already be here again and 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.129
 and for nothing else to tell ciao 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.129
 take care
