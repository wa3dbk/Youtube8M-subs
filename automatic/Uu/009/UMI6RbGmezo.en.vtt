00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
think of and I haven't been able to stop

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.780

for<00:00:34.410> approximately<00:00:35.190> twenty<00:00:35.880> years<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:38.250> few

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
for approximately twenty years so a few

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.330 
for approximately twenty years so a few

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
turning and then it just occurred to me

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
turning and then it just occurred to me
to<00:00:45.059> tattoo<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:45.780> head<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:47.640> way<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:49.379> spots

won't be able to tell that those also if
I<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.660> decide<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> grow<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.590> hair<00:01:04.519> because<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I do decide to grow my hair because I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.030 
I do decide to grow my hair because I
love<00:01:05.939> tattoos<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.869> love<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.320> head<00:01:07.530> tattoos

love tattoos and I love my head tattoos
I<00:01:10.100> won't<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.159> tempted<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> pick<00:01:12.439> my<00:01:13.439> hair<00:01:13.740> out

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
I won't be tempted to pick my hair out

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
I won't be tempted to pick my hair out
so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.630> shaved<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:15.960> head<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.530> went<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.030> maybe

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so I shaved my head I went in maybe

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
so I shaved my head I went in maybe
three<00:01:18.270> weeks<00:01:18.330> ago<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.650> hard<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:20.040> hard<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
three weeks ago it's hard too hard to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:34.870 
three weeks ago it's hard too hard to
see<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.570> dark<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.950> hair<00:01:23.159> has

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.120 

video<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.720> Saturday<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.890> one's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
video and on Saturday now this one's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:48.580 
video and on Saturday now this one's
unappealing<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.240> looks<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.720> crappy

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.350 

so<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.650> will<00:01:49.830> let<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.790> want<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> top

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so I will let this go and I want the top

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
so I will let this go and I want the top
to<00:01:51.600> fill<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.190> I'll<00:01:53.310> keep<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.700> side

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to fill in and then I'll keep this side

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.210 
to fill in and then I'll keep this side
shaped<00:01:54.510> because<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> where<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.800> pull<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
