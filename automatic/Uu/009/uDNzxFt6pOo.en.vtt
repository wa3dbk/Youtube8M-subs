00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello good again good we have 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.690
 placed the sgp incredible shield for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.410
 the iphone 5 and good the truth is that the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.199
 part of the screen is very has a 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.539
 very good touch is very very similar to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.300
 crystal is not not noticeable unless 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 let's see the cuts that you carry 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.009
 protector and the truth is that very 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 happy if it shows as we said in the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.010
 unboxing the finger or when you press 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.220
 on the screen so there are the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 fingers but but good in short 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.410
 It has a very good touch and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.150
 very satisfied with him with the protector 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 the backside good here yes I do not know 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.940
 why that gp included in Part 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 back that has a touch more more 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.740
 gummy the protector of the back 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 it's more is not crystal like the part 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.519
 front and good is put or applied the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.980
 liquid and they are good are these 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.000
 brands that in 24 48 hours 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.760
 they seem totally but the touch is more 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.550
 like most gummy guess zack 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 that one of the reasons is so that it does not 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.650
 slide the phone in your hand or good 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 If that's not true, I do not know 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
 I do not know why it does not have the same touch in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.040
 the front that in the back in the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 lateral well the finish is very 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.650
 good the cut is perfect is to be 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 very very well achieved very very accomplished 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 the cuts are perfect the only thing that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 good as all the majority of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.640
 these protectors do not think it reaches 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.740
 never cover any in the area 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.940
 beveled the iphone5 the reason is because 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.020
 yes if you passed your finger over the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.930
 bevel you will possibly take the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 protector and good this one like most 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.790
 it does not cover does not cover that part yes 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.610
 It is worth mentioning that the cut or cuts 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.970
 They are perfect and how good it is 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.870
 that touch also more gummy like the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 backside that I guess it's for the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.580
 grip the truth is that in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.430
 definitive the protector is very very 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.750
 advisable for the price if you can 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.230
 reproach that gp that put 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.480
 two part projectors ie two 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.480
 front and two rear only includes 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.660
 one and that does not leave us margin for error 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.960
 if you put it wrong then well 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.850
 you would have to throw it away and stay 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.600
 otherwise protective 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.520
 Well, very happy, I recommend 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.630
 I recommend this product that 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.920
 want to take the iphone protected and nothing 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.520
 with this I think the review of the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.310
 incredible shield and nothing we read for 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.530
 the forum and see you on youtube so 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.580
