call<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> duty<00:01:08.729> game<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> load<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
call of duty game it's been a load of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
call of duty game it's been a load of
videos<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.070> we've<00:01:11.189> never<00:01:11.340> really

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
videos on this but we've never really

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060 
videos on this but we've never really
had<00:01:11.850> much<00:01:12.150> evidence<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.740> today<00:01:13.979> I've

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
had much evidence about it so today I've

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679 
had much evidence about it so today I've
got<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.490> theory<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.090> obviously<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
got this little theory so obviously you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
got this little theory so obviously you
just<00:01:15.869> heard<00:01:16.020> Max<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> saying<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> he<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
just heard Max is saying that he is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
just heard Max is saying that he is
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:18.000> gothic<00:01:18.600> well<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> thought

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
going to go to our gothic well I thought

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
going to go to our gothic well I thought
what<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.159> there's<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.670> two

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
what if now there's actually two

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
what if now there's actually two
possibilities<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.409> he

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
possibilities for this what if he

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.859 
possibilities for this what if he
destroys<00:01:22.740> everyone<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.729> earth<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
destroys everyone on earth and then the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
destroys everyone on earth and then the
old<00:01:25.080> characters<00:01:25.590> come<00:01:25.799> back<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> moon

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
old characters come back from the moon

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
old characters come back from the moon
they<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:26.970> gathi<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.570> stop<00:01:27.840> max's<00:01:28.290> or

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
they go to our gathi to stop max's or

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
they go to our gathi to stop max's or
maybe<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.130> new<00:01:29.400> characters<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.970> we're

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
maybe these new characters what we're

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
maybe these new characters what we're
playing<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:31.079> again<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> our

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
playing with now can again go to our

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.130 
playing with now can again go to our
gothic<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.909> stop<00:01:33.240> Maxis<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.900> ripped

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
about our gathering just a second but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
about our gathering just a second but
just<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.540> older<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just think about that the older the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.530 
just think about that the older the
latest<00:01:46.530> characters<00:01:47.009> go<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> place<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
latest characters go into that place to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
finally stop either of these two
characters<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> again<00:01:51.750> i<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.170> could

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
characters and again i think this could

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
characters and again i think this could
be<00:01:52.439> an<00:01:52.530> awesome<00:01:52.770> ending<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.030> zombies

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
capital city now it's very interested

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.069 
capital city now it's very interested
because<00:02:56.040> shangri-la<00:02:56.819> is<00:02:57.150> actually<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.870> call

of<00:02:58.109> duty<00:02:58.199> black<00:02:58.379> ops<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.069> think<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.430> no

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
of duty black ops and I think that no

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.009 
of duty black ops and I think that no
one<00:02:59.790> actually<00:02:59.939> knew<00:03:00.269> where<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.540> map<00:03:00.870> was

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
one actually knew where that map was

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.020 
one actually knew where that map was
located<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:02.010> could<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.639> possible

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
located so that could be a possible

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.059 
located so that could be a possible
location<00:03:03.180> I'm<00:03:03.659> not<00:03:03.810> too<00:03:03.989> sure<00:03:04.260> there's<00:03:04.919> just

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
location I'm not too sure there's just

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.770 
location I'm not too sure there's just
loads<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.519> loads<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.819> information<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.659> this
