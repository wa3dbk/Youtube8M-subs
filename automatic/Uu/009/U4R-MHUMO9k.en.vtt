00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 in this video we will take a look at the most frequently asked questions about windows 10 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.210
 and the first day everything immediately why do I want I count 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.430
 but with this you always have the latest and most secure version of 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.880
 windows that you have available and in addition was the switch from windows 7 to 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.609
 windows 8 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.449
 of course for many people a large interface as far as control is concerned 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.000
 but I find this very well listened to the consumer in such a combination 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.609
 to make use of these two operating systems but in many 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.369
 improvements have been made and also old familiar functions are back and 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.489
 the start menu is of course a big one 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.900
 when does this time come? 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.330
 In the last few weeks, Vion has been eligible for this century 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.000
 did a message that they had a free and could go to windows 10 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.050
 to reserve 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.750
 but as soon as these become available you automatically be done ever and once 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.850
 who is available on the first learning received a notification to start this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 of course he did that from today, July 29, but it could be that 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.480
 lasts a few days 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
 to make sure you get that notification the basket the makers of piper did in phases 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 is going to roll out 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.510
 so not everyone gets the message to think about it the first day 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.620
 nac can do your computer or pc 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.450
 also our advice page in an overview of the minimum specifications 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.190
 but your PC or laptop must comply to be able to get the news 10 started 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.860
 A9 targeted percent of cases applies that if your computer instance comes through it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.810
 operating system you must have installed at this time then you are 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.770
 automatically also suitable for installing binders 10, the hard requirements, however 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.330
 that you have a legitimate way of using the seven psp 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.920
 or want them in the back 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.270
 but if it is not then he will first have to feed this 2 des 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.190
 concerning operating systems 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.200
 but how long can you upgrade now from the release on July 29 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.480
 And the users of these pleasant versions have a year to get one for free 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.430
 upgrade 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.080
 In addition, the exchange is also possible in a ten on you 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.100
 computer or pc but then you have to pay for it but how does that work 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.240
 exactly one third of all windows goes 7 out of 8 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.470
 to windows team is very simple 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 and you will be guided step by step 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.150
 as soon as a notification 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.190
 you can just let something process begin and you would step by step 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.240
 receive instructions m where necessary, information is requested after all 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.230
 You can click on it yourself and also make a separate video for it 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.359
 who shows how this works 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.930
 but what if I am not in the DTM if you are completely content with your current one 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.049
 version of windows that is of course not required to upgrade to 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.779
 windows 10 the choice of course entirely up to you 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.249
 if he did not do so, nothing will change and you can continue working 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.029
 on your current operating system 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.019
 another frequently asked question is can I speed up three of them 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.659
 have reserved moggi 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.549
 then you automatically get that notification to update as soon as this is possible and that 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.870
 currently no way to upgrade honored 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.050
 so if you were not expecting any reports, just take it easy 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.730
 bah you hand all your files and applications this is a very important one 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.829
 step in the process since it is possible to have nice files and 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.609
 preserve applications if you want the personal data or spraying 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.039
 video documents and settings can be retained one hundred percent 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.589
 but a small portion of the application needs to be redone 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.159
 installed on repaired 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.469
 since not all floats the 100 percent comes out to be one with it 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.949
 new operating system 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.639
 of course you also have the option to do a clean install 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.389
 whether to choose what you want to keep or not 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.419
 all in all it is 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.149
 and very easy to install operating system 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.829
 and they are running who received notifications can be right again for half an hour 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:20.929
 for an attack 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.559
 but they want the air to have more information about that provides us with advice 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.029
