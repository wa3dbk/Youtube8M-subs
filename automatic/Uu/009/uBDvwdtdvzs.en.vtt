00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
 roccaraso 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.800
 an image 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.860
 apparently three-dimensional 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.530
 oriented in a unique time, it constitutes our plan of existence 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 we are practically closed inside a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.159
 sensory circuit 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.969
 so until we learn to control this circuit we can't 

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.529
 have absolute certainty that things are as we believe them to be 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.400
 even if there 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.089
 you have to have the feeling of happiness on the same frequencies 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.640
 low on the same level 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 the third pedica house explains 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.510
 magic is the multidimensional choice of reality 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 and then the mathematics to move on different levels 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 of reality and consciousness that are for the same thing 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.650
 but he is always careful not to think he can apply criteria 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.380
 owning a plan to a different plan in magic provides us with grammar 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 communication interfaces are possible 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.260
 however we must be careful 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.000
 apply the laws 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.350
 of the plan considered 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.190
 for you up to cont to what extent there is an objectivity in what we 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.670
 we consider material 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.000
 the UFO phenomenon seems to be a confusion of plans 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.650
 why 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.570
 something that could instead be mixed with our material reality 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.170
 very different 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.880
 and that becomes material when we wish 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.140
 to then become energy disappear or change completely 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 this especially when trying to frame it 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.219
 norton the revolution of scientific and cultural thought 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.719
 common thing is some home magical thinking not related to me xd 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 as I told you, paying attention to what was in the aquarium 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.300
 we remain in a historical moment in which everything is called into question 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.490
 in the plans they mix together as if to reformulate a concept of reality 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.890
 in this sense, perhaps we are at the gates of a sort of great mutation 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.329
 someone calls it the apocalypse 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.579
 however, some of my writings are deeply forbidden to investigate these topics 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.579
 speaking of parallel worlds of posting planes 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.519
 there is a vast literature on this 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.099
 mostly 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.599
 in America 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.799
 rennes certainly at the global network level 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.629
 we are in the midst of a reparatii reshuffle 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.039
 you have to reformulate maniago 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.669
 according to potential patterns that can also go in directions 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.639
 very different from each other 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.419
 tomorrow apartments that are the whole story 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
 we can consider the difficult hypothesis 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.569
 after his hypotheses 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.719
 fascinating as to date and in any case you are after the first book 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.179
 in others they take on a more sensational commercial style 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.229
 this from my point of view 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:08.869
 we can certainly investigate the possible contacts with many different tools 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:10.610
 occurred in history 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.989
 also in the very ancient one of our planet 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.790
 no need to bother unlikely reinterpretation of the Bible as a faga 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.079
 cosmic 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.869
 but still questioning the birth of religions and relationships 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.139
 between man and fact 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.129
 the bible in the cud cases lends itself to an ufological interpretation 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.450
 but who are kabbalistic components that could cover all others 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.329
 meanings 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.329
 thanks for this much more explicit solidarity 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.689
 however it is not possible to lose things too much the letter and at least not 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.709
 as a part method 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.249
 on the other hand if you take platone Pythagoras 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:51.110
 own 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.529
 a little brown Jordanian brown air 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:59.079
 you find things of great interest that make you deserve much more than many 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.949
 modern authors riding the wave of the moment 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.949
 what do you mean by the term and magic 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.809
 with that term 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.839
 from the anthropological and esoteric point of view I mean 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.069
 in short, we mean a form of approach to the knowledge of reality 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.219
 the values ​​of the sacred 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.939
 in which human being stands in an active dimension 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.689
 control dyssynergia 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.659
 we love the idea imam we eat the ideas to become god this is 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.590
 the attitude of the magistra magician 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.930
 while the ass that abandons the rock activity - and I pass it up 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.479
 ecovillages stars the common informs 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.930
 active 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.289
 Resultant diseases can also be the same as the piano dia 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.429
 adv. but we hear in a serious mysticism discourse 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.800
 reverse matrix the serious mystic 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.360
 echourouk it still retain a control 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.189
 the that holds the magical attitude in the background to reach 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.189
 a communion with the whole that is within him 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.309
 it is clear that 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.960
 to understand who controls who 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.909
 we must understand that we are 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.389
 the first thing is to know ourselves 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.610
 and our true will 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.469
 then practice it on the whole 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.860
 technical data can become 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.289
 contact us from one day to the next 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.289
 vergiatese is spontaneously contacted 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.499
 but surely one cannot become images overnight 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.990
 so let's put magistri 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.449
 chiuro starts from a phenomenon of smog contacts and then acquires the capacity of the 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.650
 magistrate 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.569
 can combine 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.780
 the two things 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.090
 which will certainly make a remarkable leap in penthouse quality 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.930
 the concert is to be able to develop the ability to access the 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.990
 phenomenon of times and with the modalities that are established through a 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.279
 form of harmonic concordance 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.199
 and balanced strength 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.059
 without prevarication the loss of lucidity 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.710
 in the moment in which we still remain totally open merit 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.569
 available towards something wider 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.719
 through the increasingly precise use of one's willpower 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.349
 d more and more extended of one's senses via one's mental faculties and 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.379
 spiritual 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.139
 at this point 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.830
 vol. here is a glimpse 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.460
 not only with greater clarity what could be reality 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.749
 less and less, 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.899
 but also those that are the means and above all the end of all this 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.770
 this is the magic of relating to the supernatural 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.669
 without for this reason submitting to an authority that you do not request 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.309
 because it is the only real authority 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.509
 our conscience 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.849
 obviously in the moment in which we knew how to evolve it 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.439
 the groped according to our true nature
