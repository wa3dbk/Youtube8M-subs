00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
looking forward to Portugal but I think

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.580 
looking forward to Portugal but I think
left<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:00.910> stay<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.330> ground<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.810> were<00:02:02.380> still

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
left to stay on the ground we were still

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.350 
left to stay on the ground we were still
a<00:02:02.679> lot<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.860> work<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:03.369> we<00:02:03.640> knew<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.819> we<00:02:04.330> had

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
a lot of work to do we knew that we had

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.660 
a lot of work to do we knew that we had
some<00:02:04.660> good<00:02:04.810> preparation<00:02:05.369> front<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.489> this

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
some good preparation front of this

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.150 
some good preparation front of this
valley<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.239> I<00:02:07.750> think<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.860> help<00:02:08.950> us

valley and I think it's going to help us
to<00:02:09.369> be<00:02:09.489> maybe<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.330> bit<00:02:10.539> more<00:02:10.569> competitive<00:02:11.349> but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
to be maybe a bit more competitive but

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.770 
to be maybe a bit more competitive but
still<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.310> goal<00:02:12.910> will<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.239> bring<00:02:13.510> three

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
