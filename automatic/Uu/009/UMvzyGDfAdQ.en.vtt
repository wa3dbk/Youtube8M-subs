00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.799
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.380
 position issue 23 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.559
 and so the first place we have is on 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.470
 map fishing bay you will need 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.510
 small fast brash tank with strong 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.260
 a tower such as for example t-62a or t-54 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.150
 going to square g2 and here by 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.929
 uneven terrain you can 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 put out only one tower and put 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.500
 opponents 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 of course, the damage to the tower will be 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 it is extremely difficult to punch you even pt 10 s 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 barely breaks our bold average 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.860
 tank and he calmly here is spinning out 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 does damage and fr-shki completely not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.020
 know what to do and where to go in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 general place just great advise everyone 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.120
 Of course, if there is art, then it is there for you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.809
 will throw so here it is worth going only 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 if it is not there and then you can here 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.240
 really very good to play 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.180
 to talk and to have fun 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 time in general, I think that here and so 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.150
 feel free to play I 'm not afraid of anyone 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 cool and not everyone is still able to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.630
 there aren't any tanks there 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 formidable level 10 pad with a huge 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 break through and alpha strike of 850 units but 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.600
 the player at 60 deuce was not scared went to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 the attack began to shine began to tank and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.659
 cause damage and it turned out just 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 wonderful 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.450
 so friends do not be afraid to attack if 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.890
 you hit this card on such a tank 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.770
 how t-62a who then you can very 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.759
 good and fun to play and really 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.399
 it will be well, very interesting next 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.549
 position is not less interesting and is 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is on the map of the Arctic in g8 square 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.489
 you need a very fast tank and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 a little dexterity from here but you can 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.660
 sweep 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 vast territory where opponents 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.570
 but with enough one pleasure here 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 spend poking out there doing damage a 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.730
 then hide hide you extremely 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.880
 difficult and basically you can here 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.430
 stay until the end of the battle and wait 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.240
 comments like you came here 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 dude in general the place is rather unusual and 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.510
 interesting so i think she many 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.700
 I will like this position a long time ago 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.040
 showed but it has been a lot since 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.430
 time and I think my new viewers 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.340
 will be happy to see this place besides 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.980
 yes yes light tank this position is much 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.410
 more suitable here you can not only 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.500
 highlight but also shoot 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.050
 the enemy in the board and in the stern that will 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000
 of course is quite nice at the same time you 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.270
 can touch opponents there 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.820
 hang out damage 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.230
 them in general all this is very useful for 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.570
 teams and fun for you it seems to me 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.420
 there will be the most pleasant on such tanks 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.240
 like hellcat and chuffee who have good 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.090
 vertical alignment angles and especially 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.990
 there is no need to look for positions anywhere 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.140
 will shoot 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.770
 although of course the Chinese are quite good here 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.700
 damask and finds a good position 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.690
 for shooting in general the place is interesting and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 unusual and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.920
 and I think it is quite suitable even for 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.470
 here to bend the next place 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.310
 The position is also very suitable for 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.950
 light tank going to the gorge and then you need 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.890
 take a pretty big overclocking to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 get yourself on this position 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.450
 which is in a8 square on the map 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.290
 pearl river 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.110
 and as you can see calmly our t71 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.050
 got here and the place is very 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.180
 interesting original once i 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.450
 the truth has already shown it but since 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.519
 the map was redone and opened from here 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.440
 new features for example 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.440
 to shoot enemies that 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.050
 moved over the bridge while they you 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.360
 do not even see because ahead of the bushes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.970
 that keep you from review 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.940
 opponents and in general you can safely 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.400
 cause damage and not be afraid that you 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.770
 someone here notice if all the same 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.889
 enemy tanks have advanced a little further 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.159
 then you can shoot them at the boards 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.229
 when not distracted and of course they 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.870
 will have to pay attention to you but 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.720
 you can hide and then your 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.300
 allies will use this and 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.460
 will be able to shoot at opponents until 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.550
 from the magnitude and so friends continue 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.699
 disassemble the map of el Halluf square a3 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.280
 for heavy tanks this time with us 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.680
 a very special guest is he Loew 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.960
 the tank is going rather slowly 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.810
 hulking but even he could drive 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.150
 that zone where opponents control never 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.210
 were not on recharge he calmly 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.849
 drove and took an interesting position 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.130
 from here he can pop out his tank 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.400
 tower and put opponents 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.130
 the damage was not the others as always the grief tightened 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.310
 although it would seem there is no art 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.669
 square a3 take but they all stand there and 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.279
 cost and of course it is very expensive 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.430
 good because he can from here 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:44.130
 shoot in general this place is very 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.960
 suitable course for tanks in 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.310
 which strong tower for tall tanks 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.960
 disadvantages of this place is that 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.870
 it will be delivered very well 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.469
 Art and if its much of course better 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.919
 here do not go well, in principle, quite 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:04.319
 difficult to drive here if opponents 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.389
 normally controls the move and last 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.940
 today the location is on 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.699
 map fjords in square f9 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.219
 you will need to quietly I signed with 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.830
 good review for example waffenturger 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.889
 put in these bushes and from here you 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.500
 shoot three directions at once 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:27.190
 j5 square where opponents are very often 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.510
 rashid as well as center ef line and square and 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.520
 6 right side of the map there opponents 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.040
 very often under pressure and you can on them 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.850
 shoot this position best yourself 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.950
 manifests if your allies are some of 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.270
 these directions do not hold then you 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.790
 can devote 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.670
 and also shoot on your own 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.440
 I will light on the place quite interesting 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.780
 albeit standard 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.480
 but I think it will be useful for newcomers to know 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.910
 this position and on it all dear friends
