the new pen on version we want to fold

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.549 
the new pen on version we want to fold
in<00:00:40.230> caravan<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:41.969> quite<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.710> go

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
in caravan it's not quite like the go

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.529 
in caravan it's not quite like the go
it's<00:00:44.739> actually<00:00:45.190> higher<00:00:45.550> up<00:00:45.879> off<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.300> ground

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
it's actually higher up off the ground

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.900 
it's actually higher up off the ground
still<00:00:47.350> going<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.649> fit<00:00:47.860> behind<00:00:48.039> your<00:00:48.399> car<00:00:48.579> so

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
still going to fit behind your car so

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.729 
still going to fit behind your car so
you're<00:00:49.090> still<00:00:49.539> going<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.870> get<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.170> benefits

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
you're still going to get the benefits

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.209 
you're still going to get the benefits
of<00:00:51.250> wind<00:00:51.640> resistance<00:00:52.390> reduction<00:00:53.110> but<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.010> a

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
of wind resistance reduction but it's a

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.220 
of wind resistance reduction but it's a
bit<00:00:54.430> of<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.610> different<00:00:55.030> task<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.570> put<00:00:55.809> up<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.199> I

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
bit of a different task to put up and I

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.139 
bit of a different task to put up and I
think<00:00:56.469> it<00:00:56.589> takes<00:00:56.800> two<00:00:57.339> people<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.789> put<00:00:58.000> up

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
think it takes two people to put up

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.600 
think it takes two people to put up
whereas<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> Gober<00:00:59.019> only<00:00:59.199> takes<00:00:59.440> one<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.980> it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
whereas a Gober only takes one and it

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.139 
whereas a Gober only takes one and it
also<00:01:00.760> has<00:01:01.300> inside<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.559> fixed<00:01:02.979> bed<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.460> single

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
also has inside a fixed bed and single

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.630 
also has inside a fixed bed and single
sofa<00:01:04.600> which<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.199> don't<00:01:05.409> think<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.800> as<00:01:05.979> flexible

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
sofa which I don't think is as flexible

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.600 
sofa which I don't think is as flexible
as<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.899> go-biz<00:01:07.899> conventional<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:09.040> opposite

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
as the go-biz conventional to opposite

00:01:09.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
as the go-biz conventional to opposite
each<00:01:09.759> other<00:01:10.000> or<00:01:10.570> l-shaped<00:01:11.470> bed<00:01:12.190> fitment

putting things up network

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.050 
putting things up network
the<00:02:21.810> older<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.080> get<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.680> less<00:02:23.340> work<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.700> want

we<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.319> down<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> Cornwall<00:02:43.000> every<00:02:44.000> year<00:02:45.730> during

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
we go down to Cornwall every year during

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.759 
we go down to Cornwall every year during
the<00:02:46.849> summer<00:02:47.060> yeah<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.560> end<00:02:48.590> of

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
the summer yeah and then at the end of

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.740 
the summer yeah and then at the end of
the<00:02:48.830> summer<00:02:49.069> we<00:02:49.250> go<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.730> Attleboro<00:02:50.360> in

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the summer we go up to Attleboro in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.800 
the summer we go up to Attleboro in
Norfolk<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.150> hopefully<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.299> this<00:02:53.480> that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
Norfolk and hopefully with this that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.949 
Norfolk and hopefully with this that
would<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:54.019> easier<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.379> take<00:02:54.620> around<00:02:55.069> and

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
would be easier to take around and

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.680 
would be easier to take around and
slightly<00:02:56.959> in<00:02:57.200> your<00:02:57.410> season<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:58.220> it's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
slightly in your season because it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.349 
slightly in your season because it's
obviously<00:02:59.690> more<00:02:59.900> waterproof
