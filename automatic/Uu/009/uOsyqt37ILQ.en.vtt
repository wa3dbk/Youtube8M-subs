to<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> low<00:00:26.910> brace<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
to look at there's the low brace and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.120 
to look at there's the low brace and
then<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> high<00:00:28.230> brace<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> only

the rest let's take a closer look at how

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
the rest let's take a closer look at how
this<00:00:51.090> works<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.559> flip<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.280> only<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this works as you flip the only way to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
this works as you flip the only way to
write<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> kayak<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:54.899> pulling<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.379> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
write the kayak is by pulling up with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
write the kayak is by pulling up with
the<00:00:55.649> knee<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.370> underwater

the knee that's going underwater

the knee that's going underwater
the<00:00:57.780> only<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> pull<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:58.949> bottom

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the only way to pull up with this bottom

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310 
the only way to pull up with this bottom
knee<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> drop<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.570> head<00:01:00.629> towards<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
knee is to drop your head towards the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
knee is to drop your head towards the
water<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.219> direction<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
flipping this is completely

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
flipping this is completely
counterintuitive<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.210> totally<00:01:06.810> essential

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
counterintuitive but totally essential

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140 
counterintuitive but totally essential
your<00:01:07.830> head<00:01:08.040> should<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> last<00:01:08.580> thing<00:01:08.880> to

come up on a well-executed race and this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
come up on a well-executed race and this
is<00:01:11.340> why<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.640> practice<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> hip<00:01:12.330> snap<00:01:12.510> by

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is why we practice the hip snap by

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
is why we practice the hip snap by
keeping<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.650> head<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> bow<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> a

you'll inadvertently pull on your top
knee<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:20.100> simply<00:01:20.430> flips<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.000> quickly

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
problem with the high brace is that it's
easy<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> rely<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.460> too<00:01:44.640> much<00:01:44.670> which<00:01:45.240> can

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
easy to rely on it too much which can

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.929 
easy to rely on it too much which can
put<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.750> shoulder<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.170> risk<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> first

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
put your shoulder at risk so the first

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
put your shoulder at risk so the first
thing<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> keep<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.479> mind<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.320> despite

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
thing to keep in mind is that despite

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
thing to keep in mind is that despite
its<00:01:50.009> name<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> keep<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.630> paddle<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
its name you need to keep your paddle in
