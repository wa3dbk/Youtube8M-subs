00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.310
 there are no amorous fallacies 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:15.190
 Serrato will have so much in my case 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.190
 very much 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.100
 love 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 the girl no more than such are you choose 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 loquillo methods and today I bring you a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.680
 very nice video in which I'm going to talk 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 about the pc gamer and the great ones 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.430
 console ports many of us 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.380
 we are using this system 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.560
 to watch movies and play video games 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.680
 avoid reusing work of 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.180
 class projects work and so on 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.270
 the truth that many things of the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.580
 kingdom leaf once enter the big 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 companies like microsoft field 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.119
 electronic arts and any company in 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 this aspect of santis videogames in 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.340
 this case I will have two clear cases 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.570
 in this case the first with hosting 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.240
 accuse wax dogs the second of android is 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.399
 interest in the first in Mr. watts 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.310
 Let's start first Noordin 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.259
 obviously occupied graphic quality and a 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.660
 optimization that left quite that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.080
 want to say that there are people that was 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.990
 almost infumable unplayable is the game of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.880
 that was not going as it should go with what 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.910
 that many of us had some pretty fish 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.460
 powerful to be able to play the dead rising 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.200
 this has outweighed you a little bit more 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.030
 we would have in this case with the lords 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.590
 of watts dogs that is something quite more 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.320
 absurd that is the fact of giving a part 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.300
 of loading and not going over it 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.100
 when the problem of all this is but 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.229
 of all this is that there are a lot of people 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.790
 people who have spent money for a lot 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.830
 that will be served a lot but it is true 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.480
 very much worth this is a point that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.290
 I want to make clear people who have 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.330
 spent 3677 euros in a game for 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.080
 can enjoy what is the problem 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.580
 when this does not happen button is a game 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.459
 that does not pass the downloaded screens 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.680
 who claims who is reporting to anyone 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.010
 because you can not you can not call 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.010
 field 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.379
 this happens for several things do not allow 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.000
 comments in her video is that 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.459
 those of crisis also much more for the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.080
 got games how many do you have the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.140
 companies like they sell you a format 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.900
 digital than non-physical it 's obvious that you go down 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.209
 the price of this one for the end user 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.819
 that consoles do not do it 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.220
 It costs 60 euros via digital and 60 euros 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.180
 physical way is jorge really seems 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.480
 absurd person 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.840
 another issue is in this case those of pc 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.459
 We are sold because we have machines 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 who can obviously move that game 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.440
 very much better than any team 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.640
 body than any playstation 4 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.760
 avoiding in this case a playstation 4 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.000
 since it's exclusive to the xbox microsoft 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.090
 one 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.670
 then the failure to sell a game 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.440
 that many can not play or that 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.030
 many of us can play but for 10 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.040
 minute growths and then paste a 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 jersey screen 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.950
 something the enough solution would be to lower 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.810
 the graphics increases there were moments of 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.939
 happy that the pc gamer has always had 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.579
 the problem of the configuration of 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.010
 video game to the most personalized jacket 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.689
 our linear configuration so 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.790
 say it to your mind is a player a 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.720
 video game console is the game is 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.580
 configured from a single 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.430
 in this case I started each one 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.950
 we have to do with this is something 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.290
 that give us jerks and he has thrown us 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 better configuration although currently 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 with programs like the ford one 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.510
 experience and the day come they give 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.250
 automatic configurations since we 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.819
 they detect their own equipment and what 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.000
 we should move the game 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.609
 what we're going for is that we're a little bit 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.070
 acts the people who play times of 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.070
 swallowing optimizations 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.170
 shit with forgiveness of expression 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.460
 the games that we have paid and then 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.560
 we are against hacking but 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.860
 obviously if you can not play another 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.120
 you have to eat with chips 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.909
 the active story in that because the pcm 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.669
 It is always so sold and so separate 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.060
 of the world obviously not a pc not a 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.889
 small company like sony microsoft 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.720
 tried with which we do not have a 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.790
 company with many of those who say 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.730
 what happens with these games that supposes the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.440
 communication with camps and what 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.260
 I wanted to clarify that your deserved or pizza 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.200
 to get those optimizations in this 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.990
 case the fault we leave 7 of the company 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.360
 field envy but it's true 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.190
 that envy has its software and its 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.020
 drivers for not pulling out when tanks 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.860
 here since it's field that you had to 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.330
 have been busy doing this optimization 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:28.500
 said that although among all 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.590
 we should do something worth one thing 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.050
 to hold this kind of people because 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.080
 I think there should be a kind of 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.120
 European commercial side of whatever it is that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.219
 I could judge these things because I 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.689
 I currently feel cheated I do not know 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.270
 how can you feel but I 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.189
 I feel cheated have not sold a game 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.620
 that I can not play and not 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:53.000
 share simply have a pc that 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.310
 it is superfluously promoted I do not need to do 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.490
 more nothing knowing that my new woman pc 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.349
 sensations is without any kind of game 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.349
 four times more powerful than software 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.699
 so he asks me 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.729
 what is the solution to this what can we 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.090
 do we the end user so that 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.770
 stop passing these things that I think that 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.370
 it is in this part they are stopped laughing 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.750
 us that you think will be the solution 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.069
 to go down let the box comment 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.110
 obviously you can leave your 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.659
 comment with your expression and with 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.819
 your idea and increase all we can 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:35.310
 get to something we can do pineapple 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:38.850
 ok and send it to these 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.840
 kind of rabble corner rabble 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.520
 to be able to do something a solution to have something 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.920
 that we can claim and we can ask 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.390
 for us we have guys this has 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.290
 been everything I hope I like to give it 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.290
 turns and see you soon
