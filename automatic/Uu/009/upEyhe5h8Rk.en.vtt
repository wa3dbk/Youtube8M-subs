00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all his charms 25 and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.839
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.630
 new video and I showed you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 stuck in this new video 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 a little trick to climb faster 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 the stairs so to prove you 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 because at the beginning I have now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.109
 I guess I actually want 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.390
 of everything simple and fast so I imagine 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.500
 does this mini machine to test 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 and it works 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
 show but I'll go back up 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.910
 for for although you already understand 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.020
 I will explain the machine so 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 pressure plates here where I have not thought 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 to pick a pickaxe so here we have a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 command block already replacing its 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 part of the stone then my plates of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.539
 pressure can leukemia theory that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.829
 sends a pulse of 1.6 to his loop 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.590
 where it's not a good idea to do 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 it 's like this and every time 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 so all the tics satire a mushroom 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 two solid rotor scotch and so it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 gives unity that means nothing it's not 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 so many block bearing to a number 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 of blocks speaking certain number of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.939
 seconds what these arbitrary units but 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 which will allow to compare so I 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.659
 will prove you very walk so I 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.619
 let's go we would walk twice 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.640
 every test to prove well in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:27.090
 walking here I go up the stairs you 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.520
 see 14 exactly but less than in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 my will 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 I always stay at the testing ah yes is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.299
 this here it transforms his 1st so that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
 it's a little different certainly it's 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.259
 really fixed by logic but 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 then we will go running and then 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.520
 I quoted you after technical Crama 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.520
 we will go to class mostly magescas 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.820
 I had a little more than that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.009
 I had done so we see that it's 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.479
 it's a step 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.930
 extremely fear is to run in 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.460
 how much does one make 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869
 point 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.940
 of a second we make them one last 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.750
 good times if I do not move there is you 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.020
 leave aubeterre for a day between 10 and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.240
 11 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.590
 now the technique is what it is 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.450
 so I imagine everyone knows the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 sprint technique and jumping it 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.410
 accelerates its margin of this case speed 1 but 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.750
 speed 2 it slows back and had to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.620
 more slowed down it's good to know 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.850
 technique I 'm suicide we know this 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 that she was not here here we kept 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.870
 jumping down stairs what is 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.819
 so that was this technique 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 sometimes they do not walk and she 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.320
 blow up this fact very hard it takes 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.340
 that I resume explanations from the beginning 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.709
 when running on the stairs do not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.870
 can not jump if we run well do not 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.150
 can not jump it's normal it's 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.290
 like that I do not know why but it's 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.450
 like that we can not jump when we 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.040
 press space if you do not stop 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.130
 run 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.360
 we can not jump cc it's like that 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.459
 so with them when you press 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.730
 space as we do not jump we will not 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.810
 jump is good but sentence we jump 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.340
 not so we will not skip what makes 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.870
 we're going to leave because actually 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.340
 to slow down the march mans it's to 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 say contest in progress we jump 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.680
 is we have to leave but a spam 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.100
 in cobras space of very baskets 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.230
 very quickly 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.970
 you can speed up the yard I'm going 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.620
 to show you I would not say I'm going there 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.620
 to get there for example I missed it 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.600
 said yes I slowed down on the end and I 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.579
 put as much time as in current confessed 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.160
 tablecloth I spent on the plate 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.900
 pressure I asked you what 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 speed is going up to his homes 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.430
 so I just started I'm going 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.870
 start again because I'm not good 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:05.120
 successful but you saw that it's okay 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.440
 so here I have a little forgotten and it takes 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.440
 not do it too often I believe 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:19.370
 yes alas the 1 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.370
 it can we and I gained a little clear 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.840
 there you see that I come walking 14 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:34.530
 I 'll call you 1.14 while walking between 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 10 and 11 running so the a89 again 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:47.550
 my heart for yesterday morning eight always 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:54.360
 but hey I missed again I 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:58.430
 will try once yes the jelly very 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:02.550
 well done that's what happens to this 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.090
 mushrooms there were some from the shop 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.780
 that's 1.4 14 stick to climb either 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.690
 four seconds young diaby 4 seconds 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.289
 against 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 years to 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.729
 stairs little fake no quick game 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.110
 but that's a good technique 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.990
 so you want to time to some 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.260
 thing it's a good technique 1 that 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.600
 avoid making a huge lap time 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.210
 all that 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.479
 so here I summarized the information 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.400
 so 11 stairs so walking 14 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.169
 object which represents roughly 28 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.729
 tic almost Basque by counting the 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.150
 departure it represented a little more but 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.950
 say 28 tic 3.9 go per second that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.260
 represents you know that walking 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.060
 approximately 4 49 3 blu per second 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.270
 I will measure as soon as I do 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.500
 video besides asked so three 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.020
 notes block per second 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.789
 approximately the 10th center race 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.910
 objects why because twice to 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:04.979
 more say it's 32 / 310,6 so done 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.460
 the average actually is represents to 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.750
 about 21.3 ticks or five doubles at 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.320
 park seconds we already see the difference 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.919
 and then the race plus 7.5 objects 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.099
 7 + 8 pretty much so that a stick so 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.990
 these three blocks a second six x movies 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.669
 in every time pretty much so 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.940
 you see their name we pass theme of 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:30.990
 3.9 to 5.7 3 ie but here we 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.510
 add 1.3 and then add 1.9 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.270
 it's a lot that's you imagine 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.700
 that on a distance the hall stop and 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.970
 from May 11 a staircase that would make you 40 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.430
 block at this speed there it will do 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.560
 approximately six seconds and at 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.770
 this speed there would be ten seconds 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.909
 gained anyway some time one 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.310
 on stage can still little but good 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:58.890
 it's still time well earned 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.020
 here is the video is already coming to an end 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.159
 you now know how to go more 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.659
 quickly on the stairs but hey the 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:07.250
 technical later but more practical but 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:11.940
 good I know so much but well actually 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:15.390
 these language tics so here is the video 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.760
 is over and my subscribers are commenting on you 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.260
 what I usually never say 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.770
 nothing to say people know it very well 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.770
 well 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:26.010
 a priori you are not people not 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.419
 very smart and so well I tell you 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.789
 see you next time for a 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.130
 new video probably probably 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:33.810
 not surely on or speeds yet 

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.969
 what I like and speed and it's 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.969
 well to know so next time
