00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.880
 specific competence 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.489
 she manages to write without reading 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.330

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.220
 old in artists because he manages to do 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.840
 the things that the documents fail to do 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.060
 important league we want to tell readers 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.389

 name we have to tell them to give to whom 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.090
 look at us then nothing read more 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.329
 because even the programs are enough 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.780
 precise they put you all the plots me 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.200
