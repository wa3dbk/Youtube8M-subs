if it's Punk you usually it's rotten and
it's<00:01:41.369> absorbing<00:01:42.000> moisture<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:43.159> punky<00:01:44.159> wood

in<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.580> right<00:01:44.729> condition<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> exactly

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
in the right condition will do exactly

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499 
in the right condition will do exactly
the<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.229> thing<00:01:46.770> try<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> find<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.150> for<00:01:48.390> you

sometimes the tender fungus is hard to
come<00:01:54.210> back<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.649> where<00:01:55.830> you're<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.479> so

you take just jam that thing down in

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:12.070 
you take just jam that thing down in
there<00:02:00.899> depends<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> pine<00:02:02.130> cone

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.790 

blow<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:13.930> one<00:02:14.930> thing<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.530> heat

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
blow on it one thing is with this heat

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440 
blow on it one thing is with this heat
rises<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.310> want<00:02:16.550> most<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.880> heat<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.300> up

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
into the decor that pine cone so you try

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.620 
into the decor that pine cone so you try
to<00:02:28.250> hold<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> side<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> fungus<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to hold the side with the fungus to the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:03:21.839 
to hold the side with the fungus to the
bottom

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:46.870

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.000 

there<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:47.970> go

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
there we go

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:02.320 
there we go
we<00:03:50.010> got<00:03:50.190> fired

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.100 

that's<00:04:03.330> we're<00:04:03.540> having<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.870> dry<00:04:04.080> comes<00:04:04.380> in<00:04:06.110> even

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
that's we're having it dry comes in even

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.750 
that's we're having it dry comes in even
a<00:04:07.170> wet<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.800> dry<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.340> part<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
a wet one you can dry out the part that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.660 
a wet one you can dry out the part that
that<00:04:08.790> fungus<00:04:09.270> is<00:04:09.420> touching<00:04:10.310> enough<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.489> get<00:04:11.640> a

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that fungus is touching enough to get a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.910 
that fungus is touching enough to get a
flame<00:04:11.940> out<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.300> it

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
flame out of it

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.229 
flame out of it
but<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.040> won't<00:04:14.130> really<00:04:14.280> spread<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.030> rest

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
but it won't really spread to the rest

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.930 
but it won't really spread to the rest
of<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.540> very<00:04:15.750> well

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
of it very well

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.690 
of it very well
pine<00:04:17.940> cone<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.930> way<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.190> used<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:20.669> of

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
pine cone in a way and I used a lot of

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.510 
pine cone in a way and I used a lot of
tinder<00:04:21.060> fungus<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.540> do<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:23.010> pine<00:04:23.250> cone

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
tinder fungus to do that that pine cone

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.129 
tinder fungus to do that that pine cone
in<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.730> way<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:24.000> almost<00:04:24.360> better<00:04:24.660> than<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.930> bird's

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
in a way is almost better than a bird's

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.620 
in a way is almost better than a bird's
nest<00:04:25.470> because<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.950> burns<00:04:26.160> really<00:04:26.400> hot<00:04:26.760> it

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
nest because it burns really hot it

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.390 
nest because it burns really hot it
burns<00:04:27.870> really<00:04:28.140> long<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:28.830> got<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.160> fins

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
burns really long and it's got the fins

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.540 
burns really long and it's got the fins
in<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.820> allow<00:04:30.030> air<00:04:30.240> flow<00:04:30.510> in<00:04:31.310> but<00:04:32.310> just

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
in it that allow air flow in but just

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.170 
in it that allow air flow in but just
the<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:33.210> only<00:04:33.419> thing<00:04:33.890> is<00:04:34.890> with<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:36.120> that

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
the the only thing is with that is that

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.780 
the the only thing is with that is that
you've<00:04:36.510> got<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.840> use<00:04:37.100> quite<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.160> big<00:04:38.400> chunk<00:04:38.700> of

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you've got to use quite a big chunk of

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.360 
you've got to use quite a big chunk of
that<00:04:38.850> tinder<00:04:39.240> fungus<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.370> that's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that tinder fungus to do that that's

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.130 
that tinder fungus to do that that's
where<00:04:41.580> punky<00:04:41.970> wood<00:04:42.120> comes<00:04:42.419> in<00:04:42.630> like<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.810> said<00:04:43.110> I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
where punky wood comes in like I said I

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.920 
where punky wood comes in like I said I
want<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.410> make<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.530> video<00:04:43.770> on<00:04:43.950> that<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:45.450> can<00:04:45.630> you

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.520 
want to make a video on that you can you
can<00:04:46.020> catch<00:04:46.229> a<00:04:46.350> spark<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.830> on<00:04:47.130> punky<00:04:47.940> wood<00:04:48.530> with

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
can catch a spark on on punky wood with

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.200 
can catch a spark on on punky wood with
a<00:04:49.560> Ferro<00:04:49.860> rod<00:04:49.979> just<00:04:50.370> like<00:04:50.580> what<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.940> stuff

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
a Ferro rod just like what this stuff

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.100 
a Ferro rod just like what this stuff
does<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.860> knew<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.250> same<00:04:53.550> thing<00:04:54.110> it's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
does and you knew this same thing it's

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.540 
does and you knew this same thing it's
just<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.350> matter<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.919> lot<00:04:56.070> harder<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.520> find

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
just a matter it's a lot harder to find

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.250 
just a matter it's a lot harder to find
the<00:04:56.850> punky<00:04:57.210> wood<00:04:57.330> that's<00:04:57.570> in<00:04:57.720> just<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.080> right

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
the punky wood that's in just the right

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.170 
the punky wood that's in just the right
condition<00:04:59.510> so<00:05:00.510> this<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.260> might<00:05:01.530> be<00:05:01.710> helpful

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
condition so this this might be helpful

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.430 
condition so this this might be helpful
might<00:05:03.180> not<00:05:03.390> it<00:05:03.570> might<00:05:03.720> be<00:05:03.900> more<00:05:04.050> trouble<00:05:04.229> than

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
might not it might be more trouble than

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.750 
might not it might be more trouble than
it's<00:05:04.620> worth<00:05:04.740> if<00:05:05.010> you've<00:05:05.130> got<00:05:05.310> something<00:05:05.640> else

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
it's worth if you've got something else

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.550 
it's worth if you've got something else
that<00:05:06.000> works<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:06.510> if<00:05:06.660> nothing<00:05:06.870> else<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:07.350> thought

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
that works but if nothing else I thought

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.060 
that works but if nothing else I thought
it<00:05:07.680> was<00:05:07.770> cool<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.550> figured<00:05:09.330> I'd<00:05:09.479> show<00:05:09.690> y'all

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
it was cool so I figured I'd show y'all

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.240 
it was cool so I figured I'd show y'all
thank<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.160> very<00:05:11.310> much<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.669> have<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.850> nice<00:05:12.000> day
