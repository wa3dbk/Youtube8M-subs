this cabbage for whatever reason tended
to<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.989> look<00:02:17.200> better<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.769> it's<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.370> little

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
to just look better and it's a little

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.970 
to just look better and it's a little
bit<00:02:18.670> bigger<00:02:18.850> than<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> first<00:02:19.299> one<00:02:22.980> that's

bit bigger than the first one that's

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.590 
bit bigger than the first one that's
another<00:02:24.310> very<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:24.880> looking<00:02:25.299> head<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
another very nice looking head of

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
another very nice looking head of
cabbage<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.680> do<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.220> things<00:02:27.430> with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
cabbage you can do a lot of things with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.789 
cabbage you can do a lot of things with
that<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.019> what<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.320> get<00:02:29.500> when<00:02:29.680> you

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
that so this is what you get when you

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.340 
that so this is what you get when you
grow<00:02:29.980> cabbage<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.510> hydroponic<00:02:32.170> setup

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
grow cabbage and a hydroponic setup

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.979 
grow cabbage and a hydroponic setup
using<00:02:32.860> mr.<00:02:33.280> Crocker's<00:02:33.700> method<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.269> think<00:02:34.900> I

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
using mr. Crocker's method I think I

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.240 
using mr. Crocker's method I think I
could<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.290> benefited<00:02:35.799> from<00:02:35.829> a<00:02:36.040> bigger

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
could have benefited from a bigger

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.160 
could have benefited from a bigger
reservoir<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.510> that's<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> thing<00:02:38.110> about

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
reservoir but that's the thing about

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.280 
reservoir but that's the thing about
gardening<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.510> anything<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.630> life<00:02:40.810> supposed

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
gardening and anything in life supposed

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.590 
gardening and anything in life supposed
to<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.560> anyway<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.549> should<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:42.910> able<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.269> learn

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
to be anyway you should be able to learn

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.930 
to be anyway you should be able to learn
something<00:02:44.019> during<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.470> process<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.670> think

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
something during the process and I think

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.240 
something during the process and I think
I<00:02:46.269> definitely<00:02:46.480> learned<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.140> need<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.950> put<00:02:48.130> these

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I definitely learned I need to put these

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220 
I definitely learned I need to put these
things<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.850> much<00:02:49.030> bigger<00:02:49.299> totes<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.959> want<00:02:50.170> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
things in much bigger totes if I want to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.620 
things in much bigger totes if I want to
try<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> grow<00:02:50.590> cabbage<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.640> overall<00:02:52.180> very

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
well pleased with how they turned out

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.970 
well pleased with how they turned out
about<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.480> same<00:02:55.720> time<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.350> started<00:02:56.799> those

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
about the same time that I started those

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.000 
about the same time that I started those
two<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:58.150> crack<00:02:58.389> is<00:02:58.570> setup<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.049> stuck<00:02:59.769> one

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
two in the crack is setup I stuck one

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.040 
two in the crack is setup I stuck one
cabbage<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.820> corner<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.359> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
cabbage in the corner of the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.440 
cabbage in the corner of the
raph<00:03:02.380> bed<00:03:02.680> when<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.580> had<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> other

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
raph bed when I had it in the other

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.660 
raph bed when I had it in the other
greenhouse<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.200> relocated<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.040> bed<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
greenhouse I relocated the bed into the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.610 
greenhouse I relocated the bed into the
smaller<00:03:06.940> greenhouse<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.720> brought<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
smaller greenhouse and brought the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.110 
smaller greenhouse and brought the
cabbage<00:03:08.980> plant<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.820> could<00:03:09.940> finish

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
cabbage plant with it so we could finish

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.780 
cabbage plant with it so we could finish
growing<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.890> think<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.430> turned<00:03:12.640> out

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
growing and I think it's turned out

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
growing and I think it's turned out
pretty<00:03:12.940> good<00:03:13.210> that<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> beautiful<00:03:14.350> little

you<00:03:41.530> get<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.160> floating<00:03:42.670> raft<00:03:43.000> setup

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
you get in the floating raft setup

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.790 
you get in the floating raft setup
trying<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.020> grow<00:03:44.170> cabbage

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
trying to grow cabbage

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.620 
trying to grow cabbage
I<00:03:44.830> think<00:03:45.460> this<00:03:45.640> did<00:03:45.850> better<00:03:46.120> than<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.330> crack

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
I think this did better than the crack

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.500 
I think this did better than the crack
you<00:03:46.660> setup<00:03:47.170> although<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.610> reservoir<00:03:49.090> was<00:03:49.480> a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
you setup although that reservoir was a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.200 
you setup although that reservoir was a
little<00:03:49.870> bit<00:03:49.990> small<00:03:50.290> for<00:03:50.320> those<00:03:50.620> two<00:03:50.830> plants<00:03:51.210> so

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
little bit small for those two plants so

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.060 
little bit small for those two plants so
what<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.690> here<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:52.960> is<00:03:53.110> two<00:03:53.590> three<00:03:53.830> heads

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
what I have here now is two three heads

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.160 
what I have here now is two three heads
of<00:03:54.250> cabbage<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:55.180> two<00:03:55.390> smaller<00:03:55.720> ones<00:03:55.990> right

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
of cabbage the two smaller ones right

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.840 
of cabbage the two smaller ones right
here<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.530> came<00:03:56.740> from<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:56.950> crack<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.520> set<00:03:57.700> up

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
here it came from that crack is set up

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.180 
here it came from that crack is set up
and<00:03:58.060> this<00:03:58.420> one<00:03:58.630> came<00:03:58.870> from<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.410> floating

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
and this one came from the the floating

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.130 
and this one came from the the floating
raft<00:04:00.430> typical<00:04:01.330> floating<00:04:01.660> raft<00:04:01.840> with<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
raft typical floating raft with the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.310 
raft typical floating raft with the
aeration<00:04:02.440> up<00:04:02.740> under<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:04.060> think<00:04:04.320> even

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
aeration up under it and I think even

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.229 
aeration up under it and I think even
the<00:04:05.530> smallest<00:04:05.800> one<00:04:06.130> right<00:04:06.370> here<00:04:06.670> I'd<00:04:06.940> be

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
the smallest one right here I'd be

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.600 
the smallest one right here I'd be
plenty<00:04:07.630> happy<00:04:07.840> with<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.340> certainly<00:04:09.340> with

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
plenty happy with that certainly with

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.380 
plenty happy with that certainly with
this<00:04:09.760> right<00:04:10.030> here

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
this right here

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.870 
this right here
in<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.989> hydroponic<00:04:11.470> setup<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.190> would<00:04:12.520> love<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
in a hydroponic setup I would love to

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.460 
in a hydroponic setup I would love to
have<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> whole<00:04:13.390> bunch<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.690> cabbage<00:04:14.080> like<00:04:14.230> that

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470

maintenance no hoeing no we didn't just

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.599 
maintenance no hoeing no we didn't just
put<00:04:20.049> them<00:04:20.140> in<00:04:20.230> there<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.520> right

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
put them in there and this one right

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.270 
put them in there and this one right
here<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:22.090> plug<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.720> pumps<00:04:23.020> up<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.440> let<00:04:24.160> it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
here just plug the pumps up and let it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.659

these<00:04:25.000> right<00:04:25.300> here<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.570> did<00:04:25.900> have<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.260> add<00:04:26.410> some

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
these right here I did have to add some

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.860 
these right here I did have to add some
more<00:04:26.740> nutrient<00:04:27.250> solution<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.790> them<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.120> think

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
more nutrient solution to them I think

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.360 
more nutrient solution to them I think
most<00:04:29.110> people<00:04:29.470> would<00:04:29.560> be<00:04:29.710> satisfied<00:04:30.340> with

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
most people would be satisfied with

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.430 
most people would be satisfied with
either<00:04:30.850> three<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.480> these<00:04:31.600> cabbages<00:04:32.169> when<00:04:32.320> it

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
either three of these cabbages when it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.560 
either three of these cabbages when it
comes<00:04:32.620> time<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.890> put<00:04:33.160> some<00:04:33.370> on<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> table<00:04:33.790> but

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
comes time to put some on the table but

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.980 
comes time to put some on the table but
we<00:04:35.140> can<00:04:35.350> do<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.740> little<00:04:36.310> bit<00:04:36.460> better<00:04:36.870> matter<00:04:37.870> of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
we can do a little bit better matter of

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.630 
we can do a little bit better matter of
fact<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.380> think<00:04:38.440> we<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:38.890> do<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.220> whole<00:04:39.580> lot

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
fact I think we can do a whole lot

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.840 
fact I think we can do a whole lot
better<00:04:40.060> watch<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.470> grow<00:04:42.160> in<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.700> few

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
better watch this and grow in just a few

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.580 
better watch this and grow in just a few
feet<00:04:43.090> away<00:04:43.240> from<00:04:43.360> where<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.720> cut<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.140> cabbage

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
feet away from where I cut this cabbage

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
out of the floating round setup there's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.270
