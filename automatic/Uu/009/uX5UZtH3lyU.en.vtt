00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
10 months ago so we're basically looking

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.809 
10 months ago so we're basically looking
at<00:02:43.959> film<00:02:44.290> from<00:02:45.069> 10<00:02:45.370> months<00:02:45.639> ago<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:47.819> that's

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
at film from 10 months ago and that's

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.119 
at film from 10 months ago and that's
that's<00:02:49.060> difficult<00:02:49.389> the<00:02:50.170> games<00:02:50.590> they<00:02:50.859> played

team a lot of their hopes and dreams are
dependent<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.190> fact<00:04:10.460> that<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:11.180> might<00:04:11.480> be

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
dependent on the fact that this might be

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.780 
dependent on the fact that this might be
their<00:04:11.900> shot<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:12.860> our<00:04:13.070> players<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:13.640> to

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
their shot and so our players have to

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.090 
their shot and so our players have to
understand<00:04:14.240> that<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.690> they<00:04:15.620> have<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:15.830> manage

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
understand that and they have to manage

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.430 
understand that and they have to manage
it<00:04:16.370> right<00:04:16.579> they<00:04:17.090> can't<00:04:17.720> get<00:04:17.930> comp<00:04:18.200> in<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
it right they can't get comp in the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.949 
it right they can't get comp in the
emotions<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.190> at<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.549> same<00:04:19.730> time<00:04:19.790> they<00:04:20.750> need

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
emotions and at the same time they need
