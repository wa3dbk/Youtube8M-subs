00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello from hdblog.it may never have been done 14 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.740
 we found a minix stand that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480
 integrates some of the mini and android PCs 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 windows were just barely 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.290
 presented speaks of things about gods 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 last days we have the old models 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 my x8 the leak 7 which was just a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.650
 last year's success at the level 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.480
 international and the mini-seven that la 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.330
 its compact version though if there 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070
 let's move a little bit here 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.210
 and let's move on to what's new 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 model neo za 64 we discover that it is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 available in windows version 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.300
 as you see here on the screen or in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 android version now this machine uses 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 to the intel vetrai processor and the z 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.399
 the atom z 37 45 with 2gb of ram and 32gb of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 interior space minix sells it with 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.350
 android 4.4 kit kat 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.899
 and his personalized hawaii but he is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.239
 working with microsoft to offer it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.260
 along with windows 8.1 bing but they have us 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.510
 having said that they are practically 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 reaching final agreements and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 end they will decide if if how to sell it 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.019
 bring it to market directly with 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.939
 windows and this time it is not 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 provide a usb stick with 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.750
 inside a bios that allows 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.540
 start windows instead of android is 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 what the software support this 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
 hardware is very good for a car 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 windows is virtually identical to that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 which we have seen on other mini PCs too 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 the same intel nook or lay and if it is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 so to understand each other it would really be 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 interesting to have it with windows since 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 point of view of the doors we have the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 dr sensor can deal with why it comes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.729
 supplied with remote control then the two usb 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.350
 micro sd power buttons that do not 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.520
 so it's obvious on these boxes so good 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 that there is hdmi 1.4 port then full hd 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.090
 ethernet 10 100 and connector of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.040
 power supply included for headphones is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 a usual minix classic for those 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.909
 know this this category of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 products very well made well built 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.390
 this company really produces 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.790
 good things the price has not yet been 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.259
 clarified here they told us that that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.090
 we are around 130 where it should 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.979
 arrive on the market around 120 130 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.600
 dollars ready but it all depends on 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.060
 gives the possibility or not to have 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.509
 to have windows instead of android 4.4 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.350
 kitkat if we then pass and go here in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.090
 this side of the stand does mix of fa 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 we discover that also the is exposed 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 brand new knicks 6 this was 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 presented only a few there are just a few 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.670
 hours ago we were here ago when it was 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 when presented it is based on 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 soc 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.280
 am logic s 805 which is the version here 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.670
 see here the technical sheet is the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 cheaper version of the s 802 that is 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.380
 what we used in my x8 la 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.910
 difference between these two between these two 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.830
 processors and that this is less powerful 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.330
 consumes less because it is based on a5 cortex 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.860
 but supports video 264 h acceleration 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.140
 lution 4k this means that from 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.810
 point of view you also see here on TV 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.510
 an acca 265 is reproduced in the product 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.620
 full hd is really beautiful and above all 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.900
 this model 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.610
 besides having a jig of ram 16gb of 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.680
 internal space 8 depending on the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.299
 configuration hold on with the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.190
 Roman remotes especially like how 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.780
 I told you it will be on sale at prices 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.480
 really really boulders here have us 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.820
 advance that for retailers will be in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.440
 sale less than $ 50 so the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.690
 price for the end user should 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.209
 however, always stay below 80 euros 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.730
 let's say a good price for this type 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.320
 hardware is all for now 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 we will now try to find others 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.450
 information to be given a few a 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.980
 many before because this company 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.810
 we know he is very caring very much 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.790
 details these mini PCs and above all them 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.590
 releases only when the firmware is 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.049
 stable and the system optimized then 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.480
 there is no risk of cinesate here 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.340
 let's say in this with this company 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.900
 keep the blog in your pocket is the channel 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.400

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.250
