00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
as it was before the table

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.349 
as it was before the table
and<00:03:13.500> let's<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.609> what<00:03:15.000> cell<00:03:15.450> padding<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:17.359> let's

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
and let's see what cell padding is let's

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.589 
and let's see what cell padding is let's
write<00:03:18.959> cell<00:03:19.470> padding<00:03:20.660> equals<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.260> give<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:23.040> a

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
write cell padding equals and give it a

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.420 
write cell padding equals and give it a
20<00:03:24.599> pixel<00:03:25.139> number<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:27.169> save<00:03:28.169> this<00:03:28.379> go<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.099> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
20 pixel number okay save this go to the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.879 
20 pixel number okay save this go to the
web<00:03:29.639> page<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.389> browser<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.500> refresh<00:03:32.599> okay<00:03:33.889> so

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
web page the browser and refresh okay so

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.500 
web page the browser and refresh okay so
these<00:03:35.430> are<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.629> cells<00:03:37.430> okay<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:39.150> call<00:03:39.389> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
these are the cells okay we call it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.009 
these are the cells okay we call it
cells<00:03:39.840> as<00:03:40.079> in<00:03:40.500> Excel<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.000> know<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.299> Excel<00:03:42.750> if

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
cells as in Excel you know in Excel if

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.819 
cells as in Excel you know in Excel if
you<00:03:43.410> guys<00:03:43.590> use<00:03:43.919> Excel<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:45.120> call<00:03:45.359> cells<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
you guys use Excel we call cells to the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.509 
you guys use Excel we call cells to the
little<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.209> boxes<00:03:48.690> okay<00:03:49.319> which<00:03:50.099> we<00:03:50.310> can

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
little to the boxes okay which we can

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.849 
little to the boxes okay which we can
write<00:03:51.060> some<00:03:51.440> content<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.599> in<00:03:54.599> fact<00:03:55.049> these<00:03:55.530> are

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
write some content so in fact these are

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.449 
write some content so in fact these are
the<00:03:55.980> T<00:03:56.370> DS<00:03:56.549> okay<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.359> table<00:03:57.720> data<00:03:57.959> stack<00:03:58.459> okay

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
the T DS okay the table data stack okay

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.319 
the T DS okay the table data stack okay
the<00:03:59.609> TDs<00:04:00.060> tag<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:01.019> inside<00:04:01.709> them

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
the TDs tag and inside them

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.689 
the TDs tag and inside them
let's<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.049> code<00:04:04.310> inside<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.489> them

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
let's see in the code inside of them

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:12.680 
let's see in the code inside of them
here<00:04:07.010> T<00:04:08.010> DS<00:04:08.190> DD<00:04:08.879> DD<00:04:09.540> tag<00:04:09.870> inside<00:04:10.799> we<00:04:11.299> wrote<00:04:12.299> this

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
here T DS DD DD tag inside we wrote this

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.420 
here T DS DD DD tag inside we wrote this
content<00:04:13.560> okay<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.599> T<00:04:15.780> DS<00:04:15.959> are<00:04:16.349> in<00:04:16.799> fact

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
content okay so the T DS are in fact

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.099 
content okay so the T DS are in fact
cells<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.729> have<00:04:21.329> increased<00:04:21.719> with<00:04:21.900> cell

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
cells so we have increased with cell

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.770 
cells so we have increased with cell
padding<00:04:22.349> we<00:04:22.710> have<00:04:22.860> increased<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:24.479> size

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
padding we have increased the the size

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.300 
padding we have increased the the size
of<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.260> cell

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
of the cell

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.030 
of the cell
okay<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:27.330> given<00:04:27.570> up<00:04:27.660> adding<00:04:28.139> we<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:28.650> given

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
okay so we given up adding we have given

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.879 
okay so we given up adding we have given
pelling<00:04:29.730> to<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:33.110> sorry<00:04:34.110> let's<00:04:34.470> see<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> code

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
pelling to the sorry let's see the code

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.030 
pelling to the sorry let's see the code
we<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:36.030> given<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.660> pairing<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.320> 20<00:04:37.650> pixel

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
we have given a pairing a 20 pixel

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.920 
we have given a pairing a 20 pixel
padding<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:39.180> all<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.550> cells<00:04:41.820> okay<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
padding to all the the cells okay so the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.030 
padding to all the the cells okay so the
cells<00:04:43.200> will<00:04:43.470> increase<00:04:43.830> 20<00:04:44.310> pixels<00:04:44.550> wide<00:04:46.040> okay

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
cells will increase 20 pixels wide okay

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.600 
cells will increase 20 pixels wide okay
and<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:51.419> all<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.110> same<00:04:52.350> okay<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.220> they

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and and and all the same okay they they

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.760 
and and and all the same okay they they
increased<00:04:54.030> they<00:04:54.300> have<00:04:54.570> increased<00:04:54.900> 20<00:04:55.560> pixels

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
increased they have increased 20 pixels

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.310 
increased they have increased 20 pixels
all<00:04:56.160> at<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.790> same<00:04:57.000> time<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.690> all<00:04:57.930> increase

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
all at the same time they all increase

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.020 
all at the same time they all increase
20<00:04:59.010> pixels<00:04:59.240> so<00:05:00.240> we<00:05:00.360> can<00:05:00.540> increase<00:05:00.950> always<00:05:02.030> to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
20 pixels so we can increase always to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.530 
20 pixels so we can increase always to
the<00:05:03.150> number<00:05:03.419> we<00:05:03.570> want<00:05:03.600> here<00:05:04.310> okay<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:06.180> all<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
the number we want here okay to all the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.500 
the number we want here okay to all the
cells<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.940> control<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:10.160> cell<00:05:11.160> size<00:05:11.700> so

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
cells so we can control the cell size so

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.060 
cells so we can control the cell size so
now<00:05:13.110> we're<00:05:13.320> going<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:15.440> use<00:05:16.520> cell<00:05:17.520> spacing<00:05:19.070> and

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
now we're going to use cell spacing and

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.840 
now we're going to use cell spacing and
let's<00:05:20.940> give<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.330> number<00:05:21.510> of<00:05:22.400> cells<00:05:23.400> placing

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
let's give it a number of cells placing

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.430 
let's give it a number of cells placing
20<00:05:24.150> pixel<00:05:24.540> so<00:05:25.020> cell<00:05:25.800> spacing<00:05:26.510> 20<00:05:27.510> pixels<00:05:27.720> save

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
20 pixel so cell spacing 20 pixels save

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.730 
20 pixel so cell spacing 20 pixels save
it<00:05:28.620> open<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.610> browser<00:05:29.960> click<00:05:30.960> refresh<00:05:31.350> and

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
it open the browser click refresh and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.900 
it open the browser click refresh and
okay<00:05:32.460> something<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.270> different<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
okay something is different and the

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.450 
okay something is different and the
difference<00:05:36.419> between<00:05:36.800> cell<00:05:37.800> padding<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.280> cell

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
difference between cell padding and cell

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.810 
difference between cell padding and cell
spacing<00:05:38.669> is<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.240> cell<00:05:40.020> padding<00:05:40.289> will<00:05:41.280> change

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
spacing is that cell padding will change

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.469 
spacing is that cell padding will change
the<00:05:42.240> size<00:05:42.930> of<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.490> cell<00:05:44.789> itself<00:05:45.180> and

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
the size of the of the cell itself and

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.730 
the size of the of the cell itself and
the<00:05:46.289> cell<00:05:46.590> spacing<00:05:47.490> changes<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.930> space<00:05:49.260> or

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
the cell spacing changes the space or

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.219 
the cell spacing changes the space or
increases<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.729> space<00:05:51.000> between<00:05:51.539> each<00:05:51.720> cell

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
increases the space between each cell

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.100 
increases the space between each cell
okay<00:05:52.919> as<00:05:53.130> you<00:05:53.700> can<00:05:53.729> see<00:05:53.880> there's<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:55.729> nice

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
okay as you can see there's a nice

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.610 
okay as you can see there's a nice
little<00:05:58.110> space<00:05:58.470> between<00:05:59.460> each<00:05:59.880> cell<00:06:00.320> but<00:06:01.320> the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
little space between each cell but the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.969 
little space between each cell but the
cells<00:06:01.919> and<00:06:02.250> themselves<00:06:03.150> are<00:06:03.590> they<00:06:04.590> all<00:06:04.740> have

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
cells and themselves are they all have

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.420 
cells and themselves are they all have
the<00:06:05.190> same<00:06:05.220> size<00:06:05.669> or<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.360> original<00:06:07.289> size<00:06:07.500> they

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
the same size or the original size they

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.390 
the same size or the original size they
first<00:06:08.700> had<00:06:09.289> so<00:06:10.289> if<00:06:10.560> we<00:06:10.770> increased<00:06:11.160> let's

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
first had so if we increased let's

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.159 
first had so if we increased let's
