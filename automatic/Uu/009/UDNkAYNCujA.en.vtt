00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.349
 Let's go on 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:16.340
 More Hansen more Well to introduce this time to Come contains 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.660
 Reflect on the English reading of I want to do with the fact that because the array in Hansen more 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 I have more 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.510
 Let's do it First of all 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 And there is a boat onslaught room 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.890
 At the beginning I can withdraw three 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.500
 And 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 I will put it here 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.910
 Anymore Then I 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 Hmm 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.460
 It looks like I had pants channel Papandreou 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.460
 In I can be something here we become prima facie one-eyed port 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 In this is if you look here in you one eye of the sailing ship once 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 Well like this, I can move normally in this way 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.970
 Something in in you or doing something that fishing while in this kind of wind 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.110
 Things are different 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.760
 Contained therein by pressing the e NTT button 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.600
 You can open the chest so it can be housed here, so it's great to carry 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.930
 It's convenient and it's yeah here 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.570
 It is also possible to click by yourself this way, but the judgment is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.060
 Iyo unusual but sold in severe of 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.350
 Oh dear 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.860
 Well it is easier to open by pressing the n key 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 Then I think that I want to do various explanations such as how to make 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.670
 Next, I will arrange these three which made these three. 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.670
 White white 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:00.979
 Here you can feel like Hai 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.979
 It's such a gorgeous ship, too Here's how it looks like this 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.440
 Koihatake Roiro you are possible you here colors are also using that to use 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.190
 Ride you come to any 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.819
 Also I think it good to the various their favorite color if Well you are happy 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.310
 Since two chests are attached , press nt 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.989
 If you press that na key, there are two but there are certainly two on the right 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.530
 It should be different 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:32.260
 So let's get down to two people here . 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.210
 You can ride this ship on your own. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.350
 From the top that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.790
 Then I can get on this way normally, but I'm slammerly 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.040
 Because I can not do it 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:51.670
 It feels like I'm going to paint normally with a right click 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.360
 For is it this strong and if you lined up three or here as was adventurer if just a hole 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.200
 is not it 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.219
 This can be done 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.129
 It is a guy called hoie I wonder if it is okay 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.750
 So here is 8 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:09.290
 I would like to use it for a while 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.810
 It seems to come out to the Assassin's Creed will do I say big wow that was saying that 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.830
 Don't ask if you don't have foot greet 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:21.090
 It's a cool girl that will come out 8 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.870
 Yui was Mashi enacted, but it is the guy to say this real intention as the previous-white'm blah 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:31.140
 In multiplayer, you can get on some people 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.050
 march Planner is also recommended 8 Like this using the 1.6 conversion 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.470
 I am 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.700
 It's so wide open with nt 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.550
 Good ne 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:47.970
 I feel like yes yes 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:51.870
 Well I think it looks great if the sound of the shadows are combined so it looks amazing 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.620
 By this time I would like to end with this Thank you for watching
