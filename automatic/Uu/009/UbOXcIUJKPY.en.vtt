00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and I felt like they all shark until I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.170 
and I felt like they all shark until I
found<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:25.070> picked<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.910> game

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
found this one I picked it up one game

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
found this one I picked it up one game
and<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and I was if you know what this is not a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.980 
and I was if you know what this is not a
fat<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.779> all<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> other

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
fat and then I put it on all the other

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.560 
fat and then I put it on all the other
game<00:00:31.260> after<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.270> pretty<00:00:33.270> good

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
game after that was just pretty good

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.990 
game after that was just pretty good
with<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.160> since<00:00:35.160> when<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.610> some<00:00:35.760> sports

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
with it since when you do some sports

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200 
with it since when you do some sports
but<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:37.170> game<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.059> really<00:00:39.059> good

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
but this this game was a really good

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150 
but this this game was a really good
example<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.780> how<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.649> should<00:00:40.920> use<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
example of how you probably should use a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.299 
example of how you probably should use a
shotgun<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:43.820> discovered<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.500> because<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
shotgun I discovered that because of the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.010 
shotgun I discovered that because of the
shotguns<00:00:49.969> decreasing<00:00:50.969> winds<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.600> how<00:00:51.809> an

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
shotguns decreasing winds and how an

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
shotguns decreasing winds and how an
addressing<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> you're<00:00:52.890> having<00:00:53.070> all

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
addressing this that you're having all

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600 
addressing this that you're having all
the<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.640> beings<00:00:54.059> arm<00:00:55.039> you<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the other beings arm you really got to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.869 
the other beings arm you really got to
be<00:00:56.670> tactical<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.600> opposed<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.230> what

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
be tactical with it as opposed to what

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.250 
be tactical with it as opposed to what
you<00:00:59.879> used<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> before<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
you used to do before kind of just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.369 
you used to do before kind of just
rushing<00:01:01.649> anthem<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
rushing anthem in this you know it's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.010 
rushing anthem in this you know it's
drawing<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:07.070> what<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.850> feel<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
drawing on one what I do you feel is I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
drawing on one what I do you feel is I
hold<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> map<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.310> are<00:01:11.430> certain<00:01:11.729> areas

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
hold on the map there are certain areas

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
hold on the map there are certain areas
of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> map<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
of the map that I'm just not going to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.410 
of the map that I'm just not going to
touch<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:15.030> shot<00:01:15.390> goes

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
touch the shot goes

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.620 
touch the shot goes
it's<00:01:17.170> simply<00:01:17.680> too<00:01:18.040> long<00:01:18.340> range<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:19.210> me<00:01:19.360> to

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
it's simply too long range for me to

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's simply too long range for me to
really<00:01:19.810> deal<00:01:20.140> with<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.030> I'm<00:01:22.600> not<00:01:22.659> going<00:01:23.080> to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
really deal with it so I'm not going to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.760 
really deal with it so I'm not going to
put<00:01:23.290> myself<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:24.640> trajectory<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.600> long<00:01:26.470> shot

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
put myself in trajectory a long shot

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.830 
put myself in trajectory a long shot
fire<00:01:27.040> or<00:01:27.430> else<00:01:27.610> I'm<00:01:28.060> gonna<00:01:28.240> die<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.689> in<00:01:28.780> a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.710 
going to keep running around you see how
I<00:01:35.860> took<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.280> detour<00:01:36.520> right<00:01:36.880> there<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.270> end<00:01:37.630> up

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
I took a detour right there I end up

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.160 
I took a detour right there I end up
going<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.140> same<00:01:38.170> place<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.930> it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
going to the same place but that's it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.779 
going to the same place but that's it
was<00:01:41.320> dito<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.039> make<00:01:42.189> sure<00:01:42.220> no<00:01:42.549> one<00:01:42.670> else

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
stand in my way burning right yeah so I

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.550 
stand in my way burning right yeah so I
kind<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.640> run<00:02:00.850> around<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.270> map<00:02:01.560> mostly

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
kind of just run around the map mostly

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.680 
kind of just run around the map mostly
people<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.950> shoot<00:02:03.429> our<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.209> facing<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
people I shoot our kind of facing the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.020 
people I shoot our kind of facing the
opposite<00:02:05.049> direction<00:02:05.110> simply<00:02:05.979> because<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
opposite direction simply because of the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.710 
opposite direction simply because of the
way<00:02:07.149> flanking<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.459> whole<00:02:09.670> fam

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
