their<00:00:45.969> twin<00:00:46.360> regulator<00:00:46.899> setup<00:00:47.700> -<00:00:48.700> I<00:00:48.730> got<00:00:49.059> two

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
their twin regulator setup - I got two

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.000 
their twin regulator setup - I got two
cylinders<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.780> five<00:00:50.110> pounder<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.770> a<00:00:50.800> 10

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010

you can afford I guess you know the more

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.639 
you can afford I guess you know the more
gas<00:00:54.969> really<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.540> better<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.930> have<00:00:56.079> on<00:00:56.230> hand

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
gas really the better you have on hand

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.889 
gas really the better you have on hand
I<00:00:56.770> like<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.520> idea<00:00:57.640> having<00:00:58.059> one<00:00:58.390> runs<00:00:58.660> out<00:00:58.840> I

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
I like the idea having one runs out I

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.510 
I like the idea having one runs out I
got<00:00:59.170> another<00:00:59.350> one<00:00:59.559> in<00:00:59.590> there<00:00:59.860> to<00:00:59.980> swap<00:01:00.250> in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
got another one in there to swap in

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.810 
got another one in there to swap in
there<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:00.879> why<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.059> went<00:01:01.329> with<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.629> two<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.489> low

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
there is why I went with the two so low

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.850 
there is why I went with the two so low
I<00:01:03.850> mean<00:01:04.030> yeah<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.509> read<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.720> update<00:01:05.560> part

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
is I finally got around to cooling the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.230 
is I finally got around to cooling the
tower<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.920> I'll<00:01:09.100> quickly<00:01:09.310> cut<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:09.970> show<00:01:10.179> you

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
tower so I'll quickly cut and show you

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.080 
tower so I'll quickly cut and show you
how<00:01:10.539> I<00:01:10.569> managed<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.319> do<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.369> mean<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:12.850> easy

how I managed to do that I mean so easy
you<00:01:13.270> should<00:01:13.479> have<00:01:13.600> done<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.780> long<00:01:14.050> time<00:01:14.110> ago<00:01:14.619> but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
you should have done a long time ago but

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.350 
you should have done a long time ago but
like<00:01:15.100> everything<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:15.640> easy<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.030> put<00:01:16.240> this

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.300 
the cover for the light I thought that'd
be<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.959> good<00:01:23.170> mounting<00:01:23.410> place<00:01:23.830> for<00:01:24.099> a<00:01:24.130> small

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
be a good mounting place for a small

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.480 
be a good mounting place for a small

options on that really you can you can

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
options on that really you can you can
lower<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> voltage<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.540> fans<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.230> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
lower the voltage to these fans now I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.870 
lower the voltage to these fans now I
wouldn't<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> little<00:02:32.640> fan

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
wouldn't do that with the little fan

wouldn't do that with the little fan
that<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.209> use<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.050> want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.470> install

a bigger fan you could certainly try a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
bigger fan and then run you know a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.699 
bigger fan and then run you know a
smaller<00:02:41.220> voltage<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.810> fan<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.320> slow<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
smaller voltage to the fan to slow it

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.550 
smaller voltage to the fan to slow it
down<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.150> rubber<00:02:45.390> isolate<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.410> could

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
down you can rubber isolate it you could

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
down you can rubber isolate it you could

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
just put in a simple timer so then the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.750 
just put in a simple timer so then the
fan<00:03:01.350> doesn't<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.070> run<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> time

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
