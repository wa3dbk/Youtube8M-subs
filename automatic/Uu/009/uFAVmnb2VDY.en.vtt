00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.640
 hello and welcome again I am cease and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.240
 Today I bring you a trick here of 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.580
 sting this has been recorded in ps 4 so 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 that I will not be very sure if it works in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.650
 teams 360 or in equipment one since not 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.839
 I have the game on those platforms 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 okay and well this is done 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.460
 just in the hangar of the tower as 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 you see there's just on the screen now 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.539
 I show you the map in case you do not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.370
 you have located well since you can 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.620
 not knowing where this is exactly but 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 just start the video and I teach you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.340
 where they leave you if you come to the tower and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.350
 Well what you have to do 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.510
 basically to do the trick is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 jump right to this blackboard here 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.839
 or map as you like to call the trick 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.179
 it's quite difficult since the aunt when 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.829
 sometimes it climbs it slips even from 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.410
 agreement so you'll have to try 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.329
 well about 20 times or so until 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.479
 come out that depends on our ability 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 of jump and well then once you leave 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 what you will have to do is walk a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 little to go ahead here even jump if 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 let us pass and now jump here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.189
 opposite once jumped here in front 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.009
 you drop and you'll see here without 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 problems outside the map this the truth 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.600
 that is pretty funny and such for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.079
 show it to a friend or just 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 do it yourself and get off the map in agreement 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.810
 as you are watching out there you can not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 spend what you have to do is slip 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.549
 as you see there running and sliding in the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.930
 play is done with the round button of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.420
 agreement you give to running that is the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.579
 e3 and you give the button as I said 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.520
 round to slide the according 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.570
 because there are many areas where they are 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.250
 covered let's say the walls but 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 sliding you can only get out of agreement 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 and well now here I explore a 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.320
 little the map since it depends on what area 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.330
 you look out of the map and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.120
 either you agree or die out 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.550
 even from the map because there are areas where 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.460
 you can go through the ground and fall down and 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.230
 die I agree you so according to where 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.479
 you get it then you want and you will die of 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.000
 agreement 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.010
 Well, with this, I hope that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.260

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.260
