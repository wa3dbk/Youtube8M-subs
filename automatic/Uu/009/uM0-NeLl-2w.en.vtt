programs<00:01:24.890> how<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> thinking<00:01:26.369> about

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
programs how are you thinking about

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.929 
programs how are you thinking about
global<00:01:27.060> expansion<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.700> wonder<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.759> there's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
global expansion I wonder if there's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
global expansion I wonder if there's
really<00:01:30.210> any<00:01:30.590> communications<00:01:31.590> company<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
really any communications company that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
really any communications company that
can<00:01:32.369> truly<00:01:32.640> call<00:01:32.880> itself<00:01:33.240> global<00:01:33.750> today<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
can truly call itself global today I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
can truly call itself global today I
think<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.159> part<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.150> with

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
think the part of it has to do with

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
think the part of it has to do with
where<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.780> truly<00:01:37.020> are<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> world<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.579> also

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
where we truly are in the world but also

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
where we truly are in the world but also
what<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.390> mindset<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> guess<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
what our mindset is and so I guess I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
what our mindset is and so I guess I
would<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> look<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.180> 2015<00:01:42.840> we'll

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
would say that if you look at 2015 we'll

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
would say that if you look at 2015 we'll
still<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> road<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.310> growing<00:01:44.520> our

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
still be on the road to growing our

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.999 
still be on the road to growing our
company<00:01:45.270> into<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> truly<00:01:46.170> global<00:01:46.500> powerhouse

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
company into a truly global powerhouse

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
company into a truly global powerhouse

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
would argue that every company not just

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.210 
would argue that every company not just
in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> services<00:01:51.869> sector<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.680> thinking<00:01:53.100> about

industries even household goods or in

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.170 
industries even household goods or in
the<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.040> whole<00:03:02.340> green<00:03:02.640> movement<00:03:03.090> is

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the way that the whole green movement is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
the way that the whole green movement is
coming<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.380> everything<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.070> people<00:03:05.190> buy

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
coming in to everything that people buy

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.880 
coming in to everything that people buy
and<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.540> how<00:03:06.750> people<00:03:07.110> want<00:03:07.290> buying<00:03:07.680> their

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.400 
and and how people want buying their
products<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.760> think<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> sky<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.050> our

products so I think that the sky is our

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
products so I think that the sky is our
limit<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:10.950> fact<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.430> me<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.180> about

limit and in fact for me it's all about

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.180 
limit and in fact for me it's all about
focus<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.050> it's<00:03:13.470> all<00:03:13.590> about<00:03:13.800> picking<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
focus and it's all about picking the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.340 
focus and it's all about picking the
ones<00:03:14.430> are<00:03:14.610> really<00:03:15.150> steeped<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.750> innovation

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350

is<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.730> sometimes<00:03:36.000> say<00:03:36.570> well<00:03:36.900> we're<00:03:37.020> not<00:03:37.170> as

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
is I sometimes say well we're not as

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.160 
global or we don't have as many services
and<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.460> stop<00:03:43.790> myself<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.510> say<00:03:44.900> well

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
and I have to stop myself and say well

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.080 
and I have to stop myself and say well
wait<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> minute<00:03:45.740> let's<00:03:46.160> just<00:03:46.340> say<00:03:46.490> we<00:03:46.610> were<00:03:46.730> 50

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
wait a minute let's just say we were 50

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.150 
wait a minute let's just say we were 50
years<00:03:47.240> old<00:03:47.540> which<00:03:47.750> many<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.230> them<00:03:48.320> are<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.890> or

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
years old which many of them are that or

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.480 
years old which many of them are that or
older<00:03:49.580> by<00:03:50.210> 2033<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.650> would<00:03:51.830> actually<00:03:52.010> be

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
older by 2033 we would actually be

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.040 
older by 2033 we would actually be
larger<00:03:53.000> than<00:03:53.030> most<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.630> them

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
larger than most of them

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.980 
larger than most of them
but<00:03:54.290> even<00:03:54.680> at<00:03:54.830> an<00:03:54.950> obvious<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.990> maintainable

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
but even at an obvious and maintainable

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.420 
but even at an obvious and maintainable
growth<00:03:57.290> rate<00:03:57.560> from<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:57.950> seven<00:03:58.280> or<00:03:58.400> eight

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
growth rate from the seven or eight

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.220 
growth rate from the seven or eight
percent<00:03:58.760> which<00:03:59.240> is<00:03:59.390> really<00:03:59.630> conventional

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
percent which is really conventional

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.590 
percent which is really conventional
wisdom<00:04:00.590> we<00:04:01.010> actually<00:04:01.580> are<00:04:01.820> on<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.150> right<00:04:02.330> path

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
wisdom we actually are on the right path

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.200 
wisdom we actually are on the right path
to<00:04:02.930> becoming<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.980> same<00:04:04.190> kind<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.700> company<00:04:05.120> in

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
to becoming the same kind of company in

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.270 
to becoming the same kind of company in
terms<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.600> size<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:05.900> importance<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:07.070> that

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
terms of size and importance and that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.060 
terms of size and importance and that
set<00:04:07.580> is<00:04:07.730> not<00:04:07.910> about<00:04:08.240> big<00:04:08.600> it's<00:04:08.870> about<00:04:09.140> best<00:04:09.470> and

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
set is not about big it's about best and

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.770 
set is not about big it's about best and
I<00:04:10.340> think<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.790> when<00:04:10.970> we<00:04:11.090> do<00:04:11.270> blue<00:04:11.510> sky

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
I think that when we do blue sky

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.050 
I think that when we do blue sky
thinking<00:04:11.840> we<00:04:12.710> often<00:04:13.070> say<00:04:13.310> well<00:04:13.580> we<00:04:13.850> could<00:04:13.970> try

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
thinking we often say well we could try

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.130 
thinking we often say well we could try
this<00:04:14.150> we<00:04:14.390> can<00:04:14.510> try<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:14.870> could<00:04:14.990> try<00:04:15.080> this

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
this we can try that we could try this

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.020 
this we can try that we could try this
let's<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.710> this<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:16.010> we<00:04:16.130> can<00:04:16.160> be<00:04:16.400> reactive<00:04:17.000> to

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
let's do this and we can be reactive to

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.229 
let's do this and we can be reactive to
the<00:04:17.180> competition<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.110> in<00:04:18.800> my<00:04:19.010> view<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:19.850> always

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
the competition but in my view we always

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.970 
the competition but in my view we always
have<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.510> keep<00:04:20.690> our<00:04:20.840> eye<00:04:20.870> on<00:04:21.080> what's<00:04:21.650> going<00:04:21.770> to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
have to keep our eye on what's going to

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.100 
have to keep our eye on what's going to
absolutely<00:04:22.430> deliver<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.300> most<00:04:23.450> value<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.020> the

those are the inventions that are going

best talent sometimes it sounds like I'm

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.420 
best talent sometimes it sounds like I'm
pandering<00:04:44.570> or<00:04:45.170> buttering<00:04:45.680> people<00:04:46.070> up<00:04:46.220> when<00:04:46.370> I

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
pandering or buttering people up when I

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.520 
pandering or buttering people up when I
say<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.240> we<00:04:47.360> have<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.750> best<00:04:47.900> people<00:04:48.170> on<00:04:48.440> the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.860 
say that we have the best people on the
planet<00:04:48.560> but<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.370> know<00:04:49.610> we<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.270> we<00:04:50.600> absolutely

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
planet but you know we do we absolutely

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.770 
planet but you know we do we absolutely
do<00:04:51.740> everywhere<00:04:52.670> I<00:04:52.730> go<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.360> hallways<00:04:53.750> in

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
do everywhere I go in the hallways in

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.290 
do everywhere I go in the hallways in
every<00:04:54.260> single<00:04:54.590> office<00:04:54.980> tells<00:04:55.280> me<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.610> again

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
every single office tells me that again

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.000 
every single office tells me that again
and<00:04:56.630> again<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.530> when<00:04:57.680> they<00:04:57.740> think<00:04:57.800> about

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
and again and so when they think about

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.700 
and again and so when they think about
2015<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.000> just<00:04:59.240> think<00:04:59.420> about<00:04:59.690> more<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.350> same

2015 I just think about more of the same

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.130 
2015 I just think about more of the same
you<00:05:01.010> know<00:05:01.370> already<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:02.000> have<00:05:02.180> such<00:05:02.420> diversity

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
you know already we have such diversity

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.650 
you know already we have such diversity
we<00:05:03.590> have<00:05:03.800> such<00:05:04.040> creativity<00:05:04.640> we<00:05:05.210> have<00:05:05.330> people

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
we have such creativity we have people

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.570 
we have such creativity we have people
speaking<00:05:05.960> all<00:05:06.200> kinds<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.710> languages<00:05:07.190> in<00:05:07.370> fact

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
probably 25 different languages

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.280 
probably 25 different languages
throughout<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.670> organization<00:05:11.330> already<00:05:11.510> so

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
throughout the organization already so

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.800 
throughout the organization already so
more<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.830> same<00:05:13.040> diversity<00:05:13.880> creativity

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
more of the same diversity creativity

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.960 
more of the same diversity creativity

people with diverse backgrounds cultural
anthropologists<00:05:17.840> perhaps<00:05:18.140> what<00:05:18.650> would

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
anthropologists perhaps what would

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.830 
anthropologists perhaps what would
happen<00:05:19.160> in<00:05:19.280> our<00:05:19.370> communications<00:05:20.090> industry<00:05:20.540> if

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
happen in our communications industry if

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.660 
happen in our communications industry if
we<00:05:21.020> had<00:05:21.230> those<00:05:21.350> kinds<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.800> backgrounds<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.550> in

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
we had those kinds of backgrounds so in

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.600
