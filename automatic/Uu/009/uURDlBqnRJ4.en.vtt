just<00:00:41.489> definitely<00:00:42.210> doesn't<00:00:42.510> eat<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> made

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
just definitely doesn't eat what I made

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
just definitely doesn't eat what I made
then<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> will<00:00:44.489> make<00:00:44.879> him<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.300> mac<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> cheese

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
then I will make him like mac and cheese

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.569 
then I will make him like mac and cheese
or<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.520> know

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
or something like that because I know

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
or something like that because I know
that<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.059> eat<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> either<00:00:48.629> mac<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that he will eat that either mac and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.600 
that he will eat that either mac and
cheese<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.500> his<00:00:49.620> new<00:00:49.739> thing<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> boiled<00:00:50.489> egg

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
cheese or his new thing is a boiled egg

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
cheese or his new thing is a boiled egg
so<00:00:51.390> he'll<00:00:51.780> eat<00:00:51.989> those<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.649> um<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> guess

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so he'll eat those things um so I guess

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
so he'll eat those things um so I guess
the<00:00:53.879> answer<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.559> make

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the answer would be I would make

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279 
the answer would be I would make
something<00:00:56.010> else<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.460> him<00:00:56.690> I'm<00:00:57.690> number<00:00:58.079> two

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
isn't we've then I guess I would kind of

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.360 
isn't we've then I guess I would kind of
brush<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.409> and<00:05:35.439> make<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.889> look<00:05:36.129> presentable

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
brush it and make it look presentable

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.240 
brush it and make it look presentable
and<00:05:36.909> then<00:05:37.060> throw<00:05:37.360> on<00:05:37.449> some<00:05:37.689> makeup<00:05:37.899> but<00:05:38.800> if<00:05:39.069> I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250

quick so I think it would be the makeup
because<00:06:03.009> my<00:06:03.310> hair<00:06:03.580> could<00:06:03.789> be<00:06:03.969> like<00:06:04.149> a<00:06:04.360> quick
