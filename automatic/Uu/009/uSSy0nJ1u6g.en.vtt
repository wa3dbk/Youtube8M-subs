 here again quickly because the greater 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 part of the explanation since I already did 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 as to the player that is the same with 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:15.799
 same provision changes that the suggestion 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.799

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:25.110
 the pope all wrong here, people here 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.009

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.520
 It's no excuse and it does not have it here. 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.390
 This app here is dark 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.390
 horse still the digital comics here have 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.070
 orbits and the man in 3d 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.690
 this one is very much like a 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.650
 player 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.040
 here we have the programs chrome 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.520
 dick whats up there 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.390

 and Treatment Suggestions Choices 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.790
 also changes staff 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.870
 then he or phone it 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.920
 it maintains the characteristics of the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.430
 player 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 about the arrangement of the programs here 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:29.440
 certainly also have the categories 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:37.180
 The same is also true of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.230
 here we go spinning guys I'm 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.600
 calling here 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:48.820
 the player to show to make a 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:51.510
 comparison of the player with the one 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.510
 cell phone 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.040

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.550

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.080
 it is loading here O will start 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.250
 to charge 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:18.130
 Let's see why it 's different now. 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.080
 from my side samsung galaxy player 4.2 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.530
 and on my right side here 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.440
 samsung galaxy s sweat has not 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.320
 seen is not because that is not a seal 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.320
 there is a player come on 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.040
 the here is still a bit like there was already 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.680
 said fox news partner 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.150
 here explained junior that is equal to the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.540

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.460
 spider-man the same way 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.700
 the orb or just here he is a little more 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.620
 slow for this scroque because 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.650
 certainly because of the version of the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.330

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:14.460

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.570
 folks 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.940

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:55.430

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.980

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.850
 and he does not pick up this one in the 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.750
