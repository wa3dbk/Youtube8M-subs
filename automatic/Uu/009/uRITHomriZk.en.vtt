00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello dear friends and welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.390
 to the channel 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 appleinsider.ru as you know we 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.660
 attentively watching 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 ios 7 beta updates and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 literally last night came out the fifth 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.719
 account betta 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 and of course we can't leave her without 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 focus on the site text review 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 innovations you could already read 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 almost immediately after 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 beta versions now we are with you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.349
 I will say this look at what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.949
 changed in the fifth in a row 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.949
 go 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.859
 and start with the settings if you remember in 4 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.289
 or in all previous beta versions 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.050
 Settings icons were completely single 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.870
 the colors of blue are very boring and completely 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.239
 not interesting now changes are noticeable 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.940
 all the icons have become colored and so 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.059
 quite pleasant as for 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.339
 control point settings then appeared 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.619
 item access in programs if we have it 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.390
 turn off the inside of the control application 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.310
 center or control room like it 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.860
 sounds in Russian will not appear 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.020
 if we turn it on then it appears 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.509
 all just enough done this for 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.509
 order to eliminate random calls 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.789
 this very control webstor 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.220
 there were pluses around the price tag 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.590
 applications if the application is universal 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.170
 if you remember at 6 hp it's all 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 it was fine but for some reason in these a rs7 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.000
 this plus sign was missing now everything is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.830
 The order has also been updated. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.360
 twitter while trying to share 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.069
 photo for example you will see 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.110
 completely new icon like this 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.240
 the way it looks in the menu 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.879
 universal access now appeared 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.129
 item tags it turns on and off here 

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:51.289
 These are the tags on the switches for the forest 

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:54.950
 visibility need it or not you decide 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.840
 but there is a choice and it is wonderful she told me 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.330
 the message came now as you see in 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.069
 a notification banner appeared and a tongue 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.099
 You can pull it and in this way 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.229
 call this very center of notifications 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.399
 and one of the most requested changes 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.099
 at least in the wording 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.230
 appleinsider.ru is a redesigned screen 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.030
 turning off the device if previously there was no 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.720
 quite clear what to do to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.150
 turn off 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 ipod or iphone now appeared 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.530
 such a wonderful arrow such 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 nice let's say the animations pull over 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.550
 her and turn off the device well and except 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.650
 small external changes are enough 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
 Much has been processed within the very 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.670
 which is important skype on 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.550

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 the sick 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.770
 not close to normal course to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.610
 ideal still oh how far but improvement 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.350
