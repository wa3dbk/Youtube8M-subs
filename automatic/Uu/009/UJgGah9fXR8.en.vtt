00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.940 

so<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> just<00:00:02.280> saw<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.850> note<00:00:03.240> by<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:04.080> friend<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
so I just saw a note by my friend and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.750 
so I just saw a note by my friend and
co-worker<00:00:05.520> Craig<00:00:06.500> and<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:08.099> was<00:00:08.189> talking<00:00:08.639> about

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
co-worker Craig and it was talking about

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.950 
co-worker Craig and it was talking about
a<00:00:09.450> system<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.559> using<00:00:11.070> gyros<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.809> kind

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
a system that was using gyros to do kind

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410 
a system that was using gyros to do kind
of<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.200> Steadicam<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.820> that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
of a Steadicam like thing and that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.980 
of a Steadicam like thing and that
reminded<00:00:15.900> me<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.139> I'd<00:00:16.410> been<00:00:16.619> meaning<00:00:17.039> to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
reminded me that I'd been meaning to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.060 
reminded me that I'd been meaning to
give<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.260> try<00:00:20.000> for<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.470> for<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> stabilization

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
give a try for the for the stabilization

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.349 
give a try for the for the stabilization
on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.390> Paris<00:00:25.140> board<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
on the Paris board here you can see I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.380 
on the Paris board here you can see I
hope<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.260> got<00:00:28.349> two<00:00:28.560> outputs

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
hope you can see it's got two outputs

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.430 
hope you can see it's got two outputs
for<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:31.170> gyros<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.600> gimbal

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
for two gyros to do a a gimbal

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
for two gyros to do a a gimbal
stabilization<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> camera<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.809> I've<00:00:36.899> been

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
stabilization for a camera so I've been

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.180 
stabilization for a camera so I've been
waiting<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.730> nice

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
waiting to make a really nice

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.030 
waiting to make a really nice
you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.820> serious<00:00:42.719> level<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.980> know

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you know I a serious level you know

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
you know I a serious level you know
gimbal<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
gimbal but but I could but I kind of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440 
gimbal but but I could but I kind of
gave<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.670> wanted<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.210> if

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
gave up you know I just wanted to see if

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.229 
gave up you know I just wanted to see if
the<00:00:48.600> software<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.170> working<00:00:49.500> etc<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> made<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the software was working etc so I made a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
the software was working etc so I made a
really<00:00:52.010> cheap<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.520> see

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
really cheap one as you can see

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
really cheap one as you can see
basically<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.510> hot-glued<00:00:54.980> two<00:00:55.980> servos

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
basically I hot-glued two servos

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.290 
basically I hot-glued two servos
together<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:58.010> used<00:00:59.010> used<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
together and used used some of the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
together and used used some of the
radical<00:01:00.719> RC<00:01:01.140> mounts<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.859> put<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> onto<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
radical RC mounts to put that onto the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
radical RC mounts to put that onto the
carbon<00:01:03.030> fiber<00:01:03.300> rod<00:01:03.629> onto<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> back<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> then

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
carbon fiber rod onto the back and then

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.660 
carbon fiber rod onto the back and then
I<00:01:05.970> took<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.510> radical<00:01:06.930> RC<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.799> engine<00:01:08.100> mount<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I took a radical RC an engine mount and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
I took a radical RC an engine mount and
just<00:01:08.850> repurpose<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.290> hold<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> GoPro

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
just repurpose that to hold the GoPro

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.940 
just repurpose that to hold the GoPro
and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.330> seems<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.290> working<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:13.799> well

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and it seems to be working pretty well

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.010 
and it seems to be working pretty well
he'd<00:01:14.430> take<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.150> account<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.840> are

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
he'd take into account that these are

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.460 
he'd take into account that these are
just<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.350> cheapy<00:01:16.710> servos<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.020> hot<00:01:19.229> glued

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
just a cheapy servos you know hot glued

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.969 
just a cheapy servos you know hot glued
together<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.650> long

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
together and that this is a really long

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
together and that this is a really long
linear<00:01:23.909> axis<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.049> gonna<00:01:25.200> cause

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
linear axis you know that's gonna cause

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
linear axis you know that's gonna cause
a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> jitter<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> real<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
a lot of jitter you know the real the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560 
a lot of jitter you know the real the
real<00:01:27.840> unit<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> hold<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.150> camera

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
real unit will kind of hold the camera

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
real unit will kind of hold the camera
in<00:01:30.630> place<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> weight<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.460> be

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
in place so all of the weight will be

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.609 
in place so all of the weight will be
moving<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> downward<00:01:33.720> direction<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> there

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
moving in a downward direction and there

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.340 
moving in a downward direction and there
won't<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> stuff<00:01:36.030> sticking<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
won't be a lot of stuff sticking out but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
won't be a lot of stuff sticking out but
the<00:01:38.040> nice<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> software

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the nice thing is that the software

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:56.380 
the nice thing is that the software
works<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.070> want<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.799> GoPro<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:56.070> as

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
works that if you want the GoPro that as

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.380 
works that if you want the GoPro that as
the<00:01:57.390> quadcopter<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.909> moving<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.210> it's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the quadcopter is moving here it's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
the quadcopter is moving here it's
pitching<00:02:00.899> forward<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:03.560> backwards<00:02:04.700> with<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
pitching forward and backwards with the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.109 
pitching forward and backwards with the
camera<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.750> staying<00:02:07.079> level<00:02:07.670> minus<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
camera this staying level minus the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.920 
camera this staying level minus the
jitter<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.539> course<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.069> is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
jitter of course and here it is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
jitter of course and here it is
you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.470> rolling<00:02:13.950> left<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.460> right<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you can see rolling left and right and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800 
you can see rolling left and right and
the<00:02:15.660> camera<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.290> staying<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.880> place<00:02:18.270> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the camera is staying right in place so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.420 
the camera is staying right in place so
it's<00:02:19.320> looking<00:02:19.620> good<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.040> camera

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's looking good on the camera

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.700 
it's looking good on the camera
stabilization<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> try<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.840> find<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
stabilization I'm going to try to find a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.770 
stabilization I'm going to try to find a
a<00:02:25.040> gimbal<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.100> they<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.030> hold<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.360> GoPro

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
a gimbal that they can hold the GoPro

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.230 
a gimbal that they can hold the GoPro
that<00:02:27.990> doesn't<00:02:28.320> cost<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.770> arm<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> leg<00:02:29.240> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and
see<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.720> can't<00:02:30.990> get<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.230> mounted<00:02:31.890> in

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
see if I can't get that mounted in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.550 
see if I can't get that mounted in
addition<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.270> course<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> camera

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
addition of course right now the camera

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.300 
addition of course right now the camera
is<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> lowest<00:02:35.280> thing<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.360> frame<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.310> I've

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
is the lowest thing on the frame so I've

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
is the lowest thing on the frame so I've
got<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.640> figure<00:02:38.790> out<00:02:39.000> what<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.420> about<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
got to figure out what to do about that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920 
got to figure out what to do about that
so<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.350> landing<00:02:40.980> doesn't<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.870> know

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so that landing doesn't just you know

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.480 
so that landing doesn't just you know
smash<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.010> camera<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.520> bits<00:02:44.760> every<00:02:45.030> time<00:02:45.270> but

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
smash the camera to bits every time but

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.460 
smash the camera to bits every time but
the<00:02:47.490> overall<00:02:47.910> oops<00:02:48.420> that's<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> loose<00:02:49.200> wire

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
the overall oops that's the loose wire

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.440 
the overall oops that's the loose wire
make<00:02:50.040> sure<00:02:50.160> I'm<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.310> lumping<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> wire<00:02:52.430> but

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
make sure I'm not lumping the wire but

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
make sure I'm not lumping the wire but
overall<00:02:54.450> that's<00:02:54.720> looking<00:02:55.080> pretty<00:02:55.110> good<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
overall that's looking pretty good and I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.140 
overall that's looking pretty good and I
think<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.660> board<00:02:58.110> might<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:59.490> some

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
think this this board might have some

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.530 
think this this board might have some
