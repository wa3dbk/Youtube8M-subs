00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.400 
thousand five hundred euros it's for 25
hours<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.550> let's<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.480> some<00:02:19.720> adding<00:02:20.260> up

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
hours so let's just do some adding up

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.670 
hours so let's just do some adding up
here<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> say<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.870> three-hour<00:02:23.500> flight<00:02:23.680> from<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
here so say a three-hour flight from the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.540 
here so say a three-hour flight from the
south<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.010> France<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.460> Sweden<00:02:28.890> would<00:02:29.890> be

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.710 

twenty<00:02:36.550> thousand<00:02:37.030> euros<00:02:41.160> yeah<00:02:42.510> slightly<00:02:43.510> more

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
twenty thousand euros yeah slightly more

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.550 
twenty thousand euros yeah slightly more
than<00:02:43.860> flying<00:02:44.860> Air<00:02:45.070> France<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.750> basically<00:02:47.380> one

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
than flying Air France so basically one

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.110 
than flying Air France so basically one
hundred<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:47.860> sixty<00:02:48.130> nine<00:02:48.310> thousand<00:02:48.880> five

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
hundred and sixty nine thousand five

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.090 
hundred and sixty nine thousand five
hundred<00:02:49.270> euros<00:02:50.970> for<00:02:51.970> twenty<00:02:52.390> five<00:02:52.600> hours

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
hundred euros for twenty five hours

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.620 
hundred euros for twenty five hours
bearing<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.190> mind<00:02:54.220> that's<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.030> plane<00:02:55.300> that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
bearing in mind that's in a plane that

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.110 
bearing in mind that's in a plane that
that<00:02:56.050> can<00:02:56.230> fly<00:02:56.530> more<00:02:57.430> than<00:02:57.580> two<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.940> half

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that can fly more than two and a half

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.010 
that can fly more than two and a half
hours<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.750> would<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:59.080> less<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.880> presume<00:03:00.880> if<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
hours it would be less I presume if you

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.290 
hours it would be less I presume if you
are<00:03:02.140> flying<00:03:02.410> shorter<00:03:03.250> distances<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.150> if

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
are flying shorter distances so like if

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.600 
are flying shorter distances so like if
you're<00:03:04.420> going<00:03:04.630> from<00:03:04.810> France<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.620> Spain<00:03:05.860> or<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
you're going from France to Spain or the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.200 
you're going from France to Spain or the
UK<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.950> Spain<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.220> long<00:03:09.520> as<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.760> wasn't<00:03:09.910> over

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
UK to Spain as long as it wasn't over

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.080 
UK to Spain as long as it wasn't over
two<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> half<00:03:10.810> hours<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.340> works<00:03:12.550> out<00:03:12.790> to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
two and a half hours so it works out to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.420 
two and a half hours so it works out to
six<00:03:13.390> thousand<00:03:14.320> seven<00:03:14.620> hundred<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.130> eighty

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
six thousand seven hundred and eighty

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.540 
six thousand seven hundred and eighty
euros<00:03:15.790> an<00:03:16.300> hour<00:03:17.370> okay

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
euros an hour okay

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.590 
euros an hour okay
so<00:03:19.390> then<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.600> asked<00:03:20.170> her<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.760> said<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.030> my<00:03:22.270> boss

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
so then I asked her I said that my boss

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.760 
so then I asked her I said that my boss
me<00:03:23.850> also<00:03:24.850> flies<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.540> States<00:03:25.990> once<00:03:26.470> every

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
me also flies to the States once every

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.850 
me also flies to the States once every
three<00:03:27.040> months<00:03:27.250> which<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.910> true<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.420> myself<00:03:28.860> so

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
three months which is true for myself so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.500 
three months which is true for myself so
how<00:03:30.190> would<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.430> work<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.880> card<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.390> then

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
how would it work the card and then

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.560 
how would it work the card and then
obviously<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.930> realized<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.820> she<00:03:33.820> suggested

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
obviously I realized that she suggested

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.660 
obviously I realized that she suggested
that<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.870> wouldn't<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.320> economical<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.459> have<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
that it wouldn't be economical to have a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.300 
that it wouldn't be economical to have a
card<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.209> fly<00:03:37.540> long<00:03:37.750> distance<00:03:38.170> because<00:03:38.320> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
card and fly long distance because you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.390 
card and fly long distance because you
know<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> flight<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.940> America<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:41.220> 13<00:03:42.220> hours

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
know a flight to America is 13 hours

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.210 
know a flight to America is 13 hours
then<00:03:42.790> back<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.660> East<00:03:43.870> Coast<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:45.040> that

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
then back to the East Coast so that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.580 
then back to the East Coast so that
would<00:03:45.370> take<00:03:45.550> up<00:03:45.760> half<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.450> card<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.560> she

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
would take up half the card so she

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.410 
would take up half the card so she
suggested<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.370> would<00:03:48.490> be<00:03:48.580> actually<00:03:48.880> cheaper

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
suggested it would be actually cheaper

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.110 
suggested it would be actually cheaper
to<00:03:49.600> buy<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> share<00:03:50.830> in<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.280> plane<00:03:51.550> which<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to buy a share in a plane which is the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.060 
to buy a share in a plane which is the
other<00:03:52.270> thing<00:03:52.540> they<00:03:52.690> do<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.620> she's<00:03:53.830> going<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
other thing they do so she's going to

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.670 
other thing they do so she's going to
send<00:03:54.340> me<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.580> prices<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.110> sense<00:03:56.470> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
send me the prices for that so I sense a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.840 
send me the prices for that so I sense a
part<00:03:56.920> 3<00:03:57.280> coming<00:03:57.490> on<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:59.070> so<00:04:00.070> that's<00:04:00.280> that's<00:04:00.640> it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
part 3 coming on and so that's that's it

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.220 
part 3 coming on and so that's that's it
for<00:04:01.030> today<00:04:01.240> that's<00:04:01.450> what<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> got<00:04:01.900> the
