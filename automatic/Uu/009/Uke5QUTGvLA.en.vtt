00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
weird because this is like the same

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.339 
weird because this is like the same
almost<00:02:08.660> product<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.259> my

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
almost product that I got in my

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
almost product that I got in my
glossybox<00:02:10.679> except<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.270> good

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
glossybox except the one really good

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.140 
glossybox except the one really good
thing<00:02:12.569> about

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
thing about

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.559 
thing about
that's<00:02:13.480> different<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.250> mirror<00:02:15.700> was<00:02:16.150> very

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
that's different is the mirror was very

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.869 
that's different is the mirror was very
poorly<00:02:16.989> placed<00:02:17.530> on<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.069> other<00:02:18.280> product<00:02:18.760> it

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
poorly placed on the other product it

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.390 
poorly placed on the other product it
was<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:20.140> applicator<00:02:20.709> thing<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.310> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
was like on the applicator thing so it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.449 
was like on the applicator thing so it
was<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.610> impossible<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:23.200> actually<00:02:23.560> use<00:02:24.159> for

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
was like impossible to actually use for

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.910 
was like impossible to actually use for
applying<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.239> lip<00:02:25.450> gloss<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.739> one

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
applying the lip gloss and so this one

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.339 
applying the lip gloss and so this one
is<00:02:27.040> better<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.879> mirror<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.629> on<00:02:28.959> this

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
is better because the mirror is on this

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.339 
is better because the mirror is on this
part<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.859> when<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.640> bring<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.480> out<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.840> whoa

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
part so when you bring it out like whoa

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.490 
part so when you bring it out like whoa
it's<00:02:33.250> very<00:02:33.519> goofy<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.109> other<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:35.379> was

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
it's very goofy which the other one was

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.259 
it's very goofy which the other one was
very<00:02:35.680> good<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:36.010> too<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.189> should<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.879> known<00:02:37.060> I
