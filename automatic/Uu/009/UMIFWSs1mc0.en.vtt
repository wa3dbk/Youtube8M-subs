00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
not tempted by anything he's solid as
the<00:01:10.650> guys<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.040> ever<00:01:11.100> been<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the guys I've ever been around and that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
the guys I've ever been around and that
was<00:01:12.150> such<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> foolish<00:01:12.750> naive<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.710> me<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
was such a foolish naive way for me to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340 
was such a foolish naive way for me to
think<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> lot

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
think and I just think there was a lot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
think and I just think there was a lot
of<00:01:16.380> wisdom<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.280> everybody<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.000> be

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
of wisdom in that like everybody can be

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.590 
of wisdom in that like everybody can be
tested<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.630> tempted<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.420> think

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
tested or tempted and so I just think

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990 
tested or tempted and so I just think
like<00:01:21.810> drawing<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> line<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.920> far<00:01:23.250> away<00:01:23.580> from

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like drawing the line so far away from

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960 
like drawing the line so far away from
the<00:01:24.479> real<00:01:24.750> line<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.409> great<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.700> having

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the real line is great and so having

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.819 
the real line is great and so having
accountability<00:01:27.720> partners<00:01:28.110> having<00:01:28.409> teammates

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
accountability partners having teammates

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.120 
accountability partners having teammates
having<00:01:29.520> guys<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.180> proverbs<00:01:30.630> 27<00:01:31.130> where
