00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
percent is that understandably idea but

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.710 
percent is that understandably idea but
it's<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:26.250> tale<00:00:26.699> about<00:00:26.730> ninety<00:00:27.240> percent<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
way so it's pretty much like the grand
