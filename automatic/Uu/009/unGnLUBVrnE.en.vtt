00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 during all those 18 years that I 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.100
 I restrained the mother a control to play 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.950
 video game 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.019
 I noticed that games games and everything that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 has a certain technological scheme comes 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 gradually emerging but gradually 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 spreading like shit on the fan 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.840
 for all the bizarre giant spheres that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 we call planet earth 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.289
 once video games now only one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 option for those who had nothing to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 do 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 whether on a rainy day or when your 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 friends traveled and you get balloni on 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.329
 Your house is and much has improved. 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 who played for example a TV of 21 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.820
 square inch now can already 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 play one of these here with hdmi and 3d and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.829
 with thousands of brightness and color options 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.590
 them youtube channels today in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.940
 day everything changed everything evolved that with 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 much better and with the coming of the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 goodbye social life yes the internet sucks 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 fuck we know it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.539
 The good thing is that you know things that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 you would never have imagined that there existed or 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.150
 could happen and when I bought it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 my computer is logical, since 99% of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.830
 things i do have subject games 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 involved nor percent remaining support 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.869
 has said prince as an adventurer of the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 internet and very bizarre cases of 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.750
 people in the ninth games who lost their 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 lives or took some lives for a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.590
 simple videogame game more 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.590
 known with the famous patients 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 Mental also with me that the bug is lobÃ³n 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 beginning with this case this case is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.049
 very annoying that involved one of the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 biggest franchise is a friend of the game 36 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 a spoiled teenager and much much more 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.570
 very son of a bitch 17 years old 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.460
 his name is daniel petric a brat and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 punishment for some other reason 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.810
 this dear mother would have hidden the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 videogame your dear son 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.619
 then she locked her tight game 3 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.479
 in a key cup or cabinets I do not know, I only know 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.119
 that she played her game and the kid 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.820
 upset somehow revolted 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 managed to ruin the gas and guess only the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.030
 that he found him found a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 Your father 's 9mm pistol is the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.019
 rest you should know what 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 happened after your parents closed the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.580
 that he had a surprise for the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.099
 two do not imagine the scene is not enough 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.200
 and simple talk your mom mom mom dad and now 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.540
 close the eyes that the dog prays for 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.819
 You and his father and his mother logically closed the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.819
 eye and suddenly ball 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.340
 He killed his mother with a head shot. 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.650
 Come on because the father was very lucky because 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.239
 the shot picked up by scrape and it should have 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.239
 supported shortly after 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.360
 ok let's see the second case is this was 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 different was not quite a homicide and yes 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.819
 A suicide, the boy's name is tea. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.100
 Shall all and I do not know 13 years this 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.780

 You walk this 24 floors in this new and up 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.560
 but before jumping 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 he did something a little psychotic the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.239
 sick son of a bitch left a message in 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.799
 saying that you will find 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.000
 another life with your three friends 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.720
 game virtual paradise in paradise comes 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.359

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.280
 still half finished with popcorn 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.680
 flaming of satan's cats is not 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.530
 beauty took the last case is this is the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.079
 more bizarre and more revolting is about 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.470
 of American called tairone spelman 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.690
 27, he simply beat 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.880
 daughter to death 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.180
 just because the little girl pulled the movies 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.280
 xbox and then tipped good the guy 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 He got so pissed off and so pissed at 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.940
 own daughter who punched several 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.820
 face of the child that crazy this asshole 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 This junk I hope you die. 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.700
 choked with the gigantic cock in that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.160
 your ass it is a cretin still try me 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.350
 like the wife to the authorities 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.660
 still no avail municipal and 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.459
 half of your ass 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.719
 [Music] 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.620
 there really are people who have just 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.389
 dying 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.030
 thanks to your contact with videogames 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.699
 in fact I think that worrying about 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.699
 this is important yes but cases like 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.949
 They do not even see the stage in the videogame. 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.490
 because if it were so they would have banished 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.889
 cinema and theater and even a soap opera that 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.440
 Good fat mother watch it all does it 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.930
 part of the created art of entertainment and 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.740
 seven such cases come in the head of 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.660
 each one 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.690
 for example if the guy is capable of committing 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.180
 real life crime a virtual game 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.330
 he certainly did not fit well in the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.759
 head before you do that, but you 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.400
 even your video game arguments are 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.220
 very evil and in excess this face is 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.250
 addiction but fuck until you drink water in 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.070
 Too bad it will hurt good to 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.979
 I think it's up to everyone to have fun. 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.470
 with this wonderful art to create and 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.360
 as that saying goes not to do for the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.050
 What do not you want me to do with you? 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.570
 same 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.360
 simple and straight forward I stayed a long 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.550
 time researching sportsmen 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.250
 I do not even know because I thought it was a good idea. 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.740
 is to transform this video and I decided 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.419
 share for everyone so 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.580
 want me to continue with this new 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.020
 type of video that the other wants 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.270
 I'll talk about three 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.909
 bizarre events involving games 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.220
 erase the comet and let it 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.530
 clicking on the liked the video down button 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.139
 If you did not like it, you can leave the dislike to 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.940
 I know where it's getting better 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.069
 thank you for watching even more
