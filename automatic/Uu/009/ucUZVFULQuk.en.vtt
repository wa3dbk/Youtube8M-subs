00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.830
 of renault in may is the season 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.599
 competitions approach so we have 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.189
 decided with the team to go to 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.310
 metabief to prepare the first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.419
 round of an enduro world series after a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.980
 nice racing weekend 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.840
 generally it's a nice race with 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
 a beautiful living room is super level so 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.170
 it was a good reason for me 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.640
 to go there 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.980
 unfortunately the weather is maybe 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.980
 not top it was a bit cold 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.280
 I like to run the week end before 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.510
 a big event for have prepared for 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.860
 resume sensations to really get 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.690
 put in the race mood the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 battle was pretty tight with françois 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.240
 bailly master martin maes congolese etc 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 at 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.170
 big battle on Sunday on a 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.980
 where it was originally snow 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.100
 end of the weekend 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.990
 Well, I'm not getting too much 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.070
 Francois on the last special I 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 had to go get three seconds because 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.910
 that he was ahead after Saturday night at 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.140
 final a nice win that even well 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.229
 put in confidence for the first run 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.490
 to punta and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:08.770
 celebrated it quietly and without 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:10.170
 counting that the main goal has me 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.780
 makes the road a good team with 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.160
 jeremy ben pauline we have a small town 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.959
 to bentalha for the week 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.110
 there is in any case martine hélène martin 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.790
 who finally joined us she has 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.830
 started the week of recognitions 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.420
 because in italy before recognizing 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.110
 it's a bit new to us and we 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 usually in France 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.850
 there is no entry really does not apply 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.170
 obvious because conditions have changed 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.930
 all week so at first it was 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.340
 really dry and fast then it rained 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.989
 it's really graceful and tights and 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.000
 until the last moment until Saturday 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.230
 we did not know if his letter dry or 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.380
 wet it rained on Saturday night 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.380
 see you on Sunday 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.909
 I 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.650
 and the baquero kick also caused the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 proximity to adjust his bike so from 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.469
 to be able to try different different 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.219
 different tires erasers that makes 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.219
 enrage suspension 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.530
 m 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.959
 m 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.569
 it 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.180
 the week it's really really 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.130
 well spent for me I had good 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.440
 pretty confident feelings for Sunday 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.660
 knowing that my goal was to be 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.550
 in the first five 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.990
 the level was amazing here 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.010
 had the best descenders there 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.420

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.160

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.290
 first special manage his business the 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.180
 time scratch it puts in confidence of

 same but by cons fabien fahrenheit 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.860
 otherwise he is very second to me all 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.900
 world in some ways that bends the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.410
 race I'm really happy with with 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.180
 this podium 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.100
