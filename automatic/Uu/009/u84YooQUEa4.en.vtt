00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 yes hello people in this video I show 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.990
 give you a professional camera dolly 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.990
 from the company conova have fun 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 next to the dolly we still get these 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770
 send a storage bag by 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 We still have the dolly on the way 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 the dolly almost exists 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 completely made of high quality 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 aluminum around then the camera on the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 dolly it is recommended 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.770
 to use a ball head or a 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 Fluid head I mostly use one 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.879
 ball head as you quickly here the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 Viewing angle can change without much 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 switch to the dolly can be a 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.520
 Cameras weighing up to 65 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 So literally, every kilo uses 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 Camera if the camera then s. dolly 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.960
 attached is a directly the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.660
 huge size on now for comparison 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.969
 let's say usual camera dolly the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.129
 where many of you will certainly be at home 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.320
 have on the two axes then we have 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.750
 different marks on which we 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 can adjust the angle of the axis 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 around the camera rides in all directions 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 to be able to do for example in driving 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 for product or halt to the circular 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.950
 drive and so on around the axes but 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.080
 We have to adjust the red first 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.869
 screw then solve the desired 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 adjust the angle and then the screw 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.659
 put on again 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 the whole thing is very easy and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.060
 also works properly search the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.610
 Ball bearings are almost perfect 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.040
 Resistance of the dolly can not be so 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.810
 easy and not too hard 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.460
 now we can already with the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 actually start recording 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
 You should still be aware of this 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 that you have the speed evenly 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 Keep and smooth underground have here 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.369
 for example, somehow it is recommended 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.979
 a dolly board or yes just one more 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.320
 rubber feeder where he has some problems 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.689
 can get there is on a table 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 because of the huge size of the dollar 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.890
 not so easy the dolly 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.509
 can move or me 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.060
 now with my normal ikea 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.190
 desk occasionally had problems 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.500
 that I then came down from the table 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 am 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.910
 but after some practice time you can 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.160
 make real class shots before 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.650
 But now we come to the conclusion there 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.650
 still one or the other test recording 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.730
 the dollar was personal to me 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.250
 last truly separated out worthwhile 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.770
 I have this time for a long time now 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.170
 had smaller dolly and me with that 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.730
 not so happy when you were there 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.530
 Now as I for example a 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.720
 Battery grip still on the camera 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.640
 would like to use that with the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.130
 small clearly quite 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.650
 will be difficult because now not quite as 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.360
 firmly on the ground and had so 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.610
 I often have problems with that 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.209
 example, the camera is then tilted up 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.010
 the dolly 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.480
 I had this problem with me now 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.880
 not that dolly and through the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.770
 robust machart is oli's he likes 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.260
 I'm really good and I would 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.660
 I also certainly buy again because 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.450
 it is also much heavier cameras 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.340
 wonderful with the dollar can lead 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.320
 if you buy the dollar now 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.720
 would like or more 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.820
 to have more detailed information about the dolly 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.770
 I'll put you down my left the 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.140
 description there you can also 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.700
 times the price to the dolly look at that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.310
 It was already with the review 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.320
 to the conova dolly you are welcome to me 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.390
 feedback in the comments or one 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.769
 I would leave thumb up there 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.049
 I'm really happy 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.980
 I thank you for watching until the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.980
 next time bye
