00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.130 

first<00:00:18.440> of<00:00:18.530> all<00:00:18.590> my<00:00:18.740> dad<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:19.690> in<00:00:20.690> the<00:00:20.840> banking

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.130 
first of all my dad is in the banking
sector<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.010> maybe<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:22.490> led<00:00:22.820> me<00:00:22.850> to<00:00:23.030> to<00:00:23.780> do

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
sector so maybe that led me to to do

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.170 
sector so maybe that led me to to do
economics<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.250> generally<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:25.640> think<00:00:25.820> I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
economics but but generally I think I

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180 
economics but but generally I think I
was<00:00:26.600> always<00:00:26.870> interested<00:00:27.350> in<00:00:27.410> what's<00:00:27.860> happened

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
was always interested in what's happened

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.459 
was always interested in what's happened
in<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.340> world<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:29.540> a<00:00:30.340> good<00:00:31.340> way<00:00:31.580> of

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
in the world and think a good way of

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.049 
in the world and think a good way of
understanding<00:00:33.469> what's<00:00:33.980> going<00:00:34.070> on<00:00:34.370> is<00:00:34.609> doing

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
understanding what's going on is doing

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.990 
understanding what's going on is doing
economics<00:00:35.570> like<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.899> economics<00:00:36.320> behind

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
economics like the economics behind

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.369 
economics like the economics behind
politics<00:00:38.000> for<00:00:38.179> example<00:00:38.210> what<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:38.929> decision

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
politics for example what what decision

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.619 
politics for example what what decision
do<00:00:39.679> you<00:00:39.710> take<00:00:40.039> what<00:00:40.280> why<00:00:40.910> does<00:00:40.969> this<00:00:41.239> country

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
do you take what why does this country

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.060 
do you take what why does this country
this<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.230> does<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.649> other<00:00:42.739> country

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
this a what does the other country

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.270 
this a what does the other country
there's<00:00:43.249> do<00:00:43.550> B<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.420> that's<00:00:44.539> a<00:00:44.749> bit<00:00:45.219> that's<00:00:46.219> a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
there's do B so that's a bit that's a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.069 
there's do B so that's a bit that's a
bit<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.519> main<00:00:46.699> underlying<00:00:47.449> reason<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.870> think

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
bit the main underlying reason I think

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.930 
bit the main underlying reason I think
so<00:00:49.070> for<00:00:49.399> previously<00:00:49.999> I<00:00:50.420> studied<00:00:51.170> in<00:00:51.260> Belgium

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
so for previously I studied in Belgium

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.689 
so for previously I studied in Belgium
and<00:00:53.499> after<00:00:54.499> that<00:00:54.620> after<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.370> master<00:00:55.550> in

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
and after that after the master in

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.130 
and after that after the master in
Belgium<00:00:55.999> I<00:00:56.149> wanted<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.569> broaden<00:00:56.870> my<00:00:57.019> knowledge

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
Belgium I wanted to broaden my knowledge

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.770 
Belgium I wanted to broaden my knowledge
in<00:00:57.739> economics<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.339> also<00:00:58.579> together<00:00:58.909> with<00:00:59.179> with
