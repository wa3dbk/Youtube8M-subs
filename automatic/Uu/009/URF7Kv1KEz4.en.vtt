00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.810
 I'll give it to that already bmw two op 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.550
 I liked that very much 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.250
 a car in the right size in 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.470
 cuddly design now gives bmw one 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 after convertible was to be expected 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 the convertible of two convertible is opposite 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.160
 The 1 Series Convertible has become a little bigger 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.350
 7 cm longer has the length of a 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.930
 e36 is much wider 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.360
 the joke is another the car works 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.730
 through the stretched harmonious very 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.960
 harmonic proportions larger and larger 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.960
 cheaper than it actually is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.710
 O 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 unlike the four convertible with the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.700
 foldable tin roof sets bmw at 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 two on a cloth pants 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 I personally think that's good and right 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.780
 so and there are many people the things 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.240
 cabrio has actual material obscuring 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.909
 own the hood here at the two 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 always opens and closes electrically and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.690
 always has an elaborate acoustic 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.340
 the insulation should of course be the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.340
 minimize noise at high tempo 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.530
 I like it two convertible exceptionally 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.510
 good has a nice size very much 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.490
 successful design elaborate concealed 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.310
 in february next year we start 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.110
 There are four engines to start 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.640
 powerful model is the m2 35i 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
 with 326 ps 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940
 the classic straight-six the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.340
 Of course, I strongly recommend 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.050
 and do not forget longitudinally installed 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.700
 There are engines rear-wheel drive in this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.700
 not too sad
