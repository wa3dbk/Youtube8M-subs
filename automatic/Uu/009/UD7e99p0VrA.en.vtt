00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.120
 the root children take a group of 16 children to an unusual place 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.650
 In the middle of the farm of family there is a kindergarten 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 somewhere in Schleswig-Holstein the Baltic Sea is not far away 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.800
 she has been working here for nine years 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 Janker trained educator nature games educators and educated 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.980
 storyteller 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 she tests heart and soul 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.780
 we literally experience with all our senses we have quite completely 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.940
 Lots of freedom are unlikely to know many animals and we are here in the middle of it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.789
 the farm 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.759
 we can pet the animals every san10 we can pet the accused 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:10.760
 to draw 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 now work well with a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 Kindergarten on the farm 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 so this is not just about Antic the root kids have to tackle with so 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.840
 today as well 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.270
 it's Wednesday Feeding Starck 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.520
 This time it's the pigs' turn 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.300
 meanwhile everything goes without saying for the children 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.760
 I think that's what this life on the farm is now 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.960
 has really happened so if it's just a normal for them 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.180
 So that's just straw anytime or is that the most diverse animals there 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.590
 are that on some photos or not being is dead or that are 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.670
 that birth is just going to be part of the joie de vivre 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.920
 every day with assistant also something special though 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.490
 they are very social and on the bed and now 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.210
 I think it makes them more tolerant and ends 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.830
 open 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.329
 Years ago, the wife had to give the farmer's wife a vision 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.809
 Children belong on the farm 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.069
 There is not only the kindergarten in the afternoons 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.379
 countless events on the subject of the environment offered 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.379
 they can also be perceived by external visitors 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.180
 among all this is a simple life-saving animals and nature with all the senses 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.659
 experience 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.469
 The Bauhof kindergarten is a prime example of environmental education in 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.749
 Schleswig-Holstein 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.699
 the goal of our education policy is in percent kindergartens school 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.059
 Of course, that children know as much as possible 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.279
 about their environment about nature that 7 animals and plants know 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.969
 but not all in the sense of an accumulation of knowledge and experience 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.379
 but with the goal to make the children in the world 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.959
 Percent of the nature of their changes and also Bern the meaning of this tent 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.469
 recognize these relationships AP as early as possible 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.189
 if children really believe that cows are purple they keep coming back 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.499
 such investigation 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.709
 maybe in schleswig-holstein the proximity to nature and the landscape is still 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.119
 a bit bigger than maybe in very densely populated areas 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 integrated 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.299
 No to life on the farm Kindergarten is not just part of the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.789
 Dealing with the animals 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.749
 Also agricultural plants and products should be with all senses 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.299
 get to know each other 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.849
 Today, the children themselves make minutes of baking bread 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
 Of course, the scattering comes from your own farm 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.379
 June 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.019
 already here for nature and environmental education 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.070
 Encounter with nature but also know 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.100
 in particular, and percent play a big role in the kindergarten 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.209
 to do this, the educational path of a 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.499
 Child's parenting money always looks the principle percent the sooner the better 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.309
 It all depends on the beginning 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.249
 and children are taken for granted here 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.779
 in kindergarten deal with the environment learn something about nature and about 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.469
 relationships 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.489
 they will be even better prepared for this at school this year and 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.959
 in the curricula JPY Education for Sustainable Development and Environment 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 Education is part of a big role 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.440
 the picture picture 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.090
 a process of dealing with the environment more responsibly 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.830
 Dealing with and having a sense of duty for the environment that is the goal 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.759
 Competencies are to be acquired in education for sustainable development 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.080
 become actively and independently responsible for shaping the future 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.270

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:48.779

 Bake today at the bun 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.830
 In any case, Bianca does learning by doing for the future of children 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.529
 no worries 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.729
 Simply singing such a great social skills net that they already do so
