00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
in a different direction so for example

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.630 
in a different direction so for example
drilling<00:03:03.560> with<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> right<00:03:04.040> button<00:03:04.250> may

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
tighten a screw while the left button

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.660 
tighten a screw while the left button
would<00:03:06.920> loosen<00:03:07.220> it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
would loosen it

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
but there's even more to it you can

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.390 
but there's even more to it you can
actually<00:03:11.959> shift<00:03:12.440> gears<00:03:12.890> while<00:03:13.130> drilling

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
actually shift gears while drilling

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.240 
actually shift gears while drilling

good to do it I mean you actually have

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.229 
good to do it I mean you actually have
to<00:03:18.290> repress<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.100> shoulder<00:03:19.459> button<00:03:19.760> at<00:03:19.910> just

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
to repress the shoulder button at just

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.820 
to repress the shoulder button at just
the<00:03:20.330> right<00:03:20.480> moment<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.200> you're<00:03:21.380> really

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
the right moment like you're really

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
shifting gears it just feels so right

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.710

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
just find the right part or drill the

just find the right part or drill the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
of course this drill can get a little

of course this drill can get a little

dull from time to time I mean the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.460 
dull from time to time I mean the
drawback<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.120> design<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.750> focus<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:09.410> a

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
single gameplay element is that it's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.200

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
focused on a single gameplay element so

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.850 
focused on a single gameplay element so
