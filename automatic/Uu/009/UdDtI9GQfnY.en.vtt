00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
for me then I slide to their C power

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.940 
for me then I slide to their C power
chord<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.870> slide<00:03:13.230> after<00:03:13.590> that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
chord right here and I slide after that

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.360 
chord right here and I slide after that
I<00:03:14.100> slide<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> be<00:03:14.580> G<00:03:14.790> power<00:03:15.030> chord<00:03:15.150> right<00:03:15.480> here

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
I slide to be G power chord right here

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.470 
I slide to be G power chord right here
so<00:03:17.370> basically<00:03:17.790> what<00:03:18.000> you're<00:03:18.090> doing<00:03:18.150> you're

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
so basically what you're doing you're

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.160 
so basically what you're doing you're
just<00:03:18.510> lying

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
just lying

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:28.540 
just lying
um<00:03:19.490> two<00:03:20.490> frets<00:03:20.760> up<00:03:21.030> every<00:03:21.330> time

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:40.210 

so<00:03:29.550> let's<00:03:29.819> see<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.060> from<00:03:30.209> beginning<00:03:30.330> again

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.260 

and<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.460> I'm<00:03:41.610> going<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> play<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> little

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
and this I'm going to play the little

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.990 
and this I'm going to play the little
bit<00:03:42.450> faster<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.730> get<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
bit faster so I can really get the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.180 
bit faster so I can really get the
rhythm<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.569> song

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.260 

now<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.460> do<00:03:55.580> with<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.790> second<00:03:56.120> time

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
now we have to do with the second time

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.350 
now we have to do with the second time
you<00:03:56.390> place<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:58.160> know<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.370> riff<00:03:58.550> again<00:03:58.730> he

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
you place the you know the riff again he

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.800 
you place the you know the riff again he
doesn't<00:03:59.690> play<00:03:59.840> this<00:04:00.020> slice<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.970> it's<00:04:02.150> just<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
doesn't play this slice so it's just and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.750 
doesn't play this slice so it's just and
nothing

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.780 

and<00:04:16.760> that's<00:04:17.540> actually<00:04:17.690> if<00:04:18.160> I'm<00:04:19.160> going<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.640> play

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
and that's actually if I'm going to play

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.759 
and that's actually if I'm going to play
it<00:04:19.850> one<00:04:20.000> more<00:04:20.239> time<00:04:20.390> on<00:04:20.660> speed<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.560> I'm<00:04:21.650> going

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
it one more time on speed and I'm going

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.100 
it one more time on speed and I'm going
to<00:04:21.859> assume<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.190> little<00:04:22.550> bit<00:04:22.640> out<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.810> can

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
to assume a little bit out so you can

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.620 
to assume a little bit out so you can
see<00:04:24.580> hopefully<00:04:25.580> also<00:04:25.730> see<00:04:26.030> my<00:04:26.150> opinion<00:04:26.450> here

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
see hopefully also see my opinion here

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:40.409 
see hopefully also see my opinion here
right<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:27.160> all<00:04:28.160> right<00:04:28.220> like<00:04:28.610> this

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.010
