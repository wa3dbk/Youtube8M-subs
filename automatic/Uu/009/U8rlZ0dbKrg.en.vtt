00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.550
 good morning this summer i decided to go 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.720
 with musical they are abroad to 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 adequately represent our country and decided 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.860
 learn more in Belarusian folk 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 dance 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.529
 also now occupies an important place in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 national culture of Belarusians 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.609
 and the Russian soul of the people was here today 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:25.989
 holiday 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.329
 today's Russian newspaper then 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.919
 have we have a wonderful world 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.310
 who sell 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.620
 unknown basis of the Belarusian dance 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.580
 all born and dead 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.840
 in the second 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.540
 Well, Slavic data differ only with 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350
 Kazakhstan and United States per kg 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.420
 hype 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 you can say 0 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 the current situation is not so Russia itself 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 I want to say 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.260
 complex jumps like Ukrainian stations 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410
 the solution was called calm and how 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.800
 say historians and notice suture but 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.089
 if so for the national team 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.490
 not worth 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.040
 if you think it all remains in 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840
 the past why nobody dances 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.780
 the body is human in many cities 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.310
 villages villages and hearts availability 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.990
 graphic classes in which you can 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.259
 learn Belarusian dance 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.960
 such as only a little more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719
 I like many others only 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.800
 laugh because 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.160
 May 20th to the Belarusian dance 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.880
 find out all the news about us because he 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.670
 did not name 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.490
 he doesn't even know that I like everything 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 it's ok now 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.380
 public reception 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.899
 no six minutes later to the district court 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.570
 Saratov in Kosovo who can remotely in 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.520
 Ministry of Economics 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.430
 I have such a country to court 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 by the way many flow of folk dances 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.930
 can meet modern 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 choreography 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
 before the concert 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.099
 the popularity of the alliance while gold is more expensive 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.739
 and if initially the portal is clear 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.829
 Khasan district 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.450
 network seems so simple 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.720
 but in fact, the strength of a smile guys 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.800
 will meet a huge effective work though 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.270
 coal 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.909
 the most beautiful 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.329
 ohh samotlor nn other dances in the same 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.329
 the most important thing is 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.290
 everything is done in the wrong place 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.369
 consultant especially for you 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.619
 this is it on the eve of the official place 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.479
 for exploring new prices and the most 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.769
 terrible truth about the right 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.560
 organizations 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.690
 whereas earlier she said that he 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.589
 seemed 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.159
 so far 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.509
 our dances Tymoshenko 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.509
 in particular, great 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.989
 Now I definitely do not use 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.099
 Belarusian both on concealment a fisherman 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.459
 unacceptable to dance but there is 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.049
 many reasons main disadvantages but this is still
