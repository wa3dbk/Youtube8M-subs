then<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:35.970> obviously<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:36.990> tear<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
then they obviously can can't tear this

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.190 
then they obviously can can't tear this
up<00:01:37.549> also<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:38.820> skip<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> it'll<00:01:39.960> skip

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
up also it does skip well is it'll skip

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
up also it does skip well is it'll skip
under<00:01:40.320> mangroves<00:01:40.860> pretty<00:01:41.729> well<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.090> least

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
under mangroves pretty well at least

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539 
under mangroves pretty well at least
they'll<00:01:42.450> skip<00:01:42.689> far<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> only<00:01:43.979> problem<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
they'll skip far but the only problem is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.010 
they'll skip far but the only problem is
when<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.060> skipping<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.689> never<00:01:45.840> know

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
when you are skipping it you never know

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.120 
when you are skipping it you never know
if<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
if it's going to go to the right or the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.700 
if it's going to go to the right or the
left<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.670> way<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> very

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
left or way up so it's not a very

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
left or way up so it's not a very
controlled<00:01:50.189> skip<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.970> skip<00:01:51.270> also<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
controlled skip but it will skip also to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.670 
controlled skip but it will skip also to
a<00:01:52.590> con<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.530> does

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
a con is that it does you know does

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
a con is that it does you know does
require<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.939> sprayed<00:01:57.240> down<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> end

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
require to be sprayed down at the end

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.499 
require to be sprayed down at the end
I've<00:01:57.960> only<00:01:58.140> use<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> couple<00:01:58.649> times

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
I've only use this one a couple times

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.399 
I've only use this one a couple times
probably<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> them<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> didn't<00:02:01.170> spray<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
probably one of them I didn't spray it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.420 
probably one of them I didn't spray it
down<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.159> already<00:02:02.310> starting

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
down you can see it's already starting

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.969 
down you can see it's already starting
to<00:02:02.790> rust<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.329> bit<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.439> doesn't<00:02:04.469> does

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979

these<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.369> always<00:02:05.490> last<00:02:05.909> long<00:02:06.149> unless<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
these don't always last long unless you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
these don't always last long unless you
just<00:02:07.020> take<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.409> care<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> Molli<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.099> really

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
just take good care of Molli and really

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
just take good care of Molli and really
all<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.940> spray<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> down<00:02:09.420> it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
all you do is just spray it down it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.140 
all you do is just spray it down it's
pretty<00:02:09.989> simple<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.310> anyhow<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.940> there's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
pretty simple but so anyhow that there's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.230 
pretty simple but so anyhow that there's
a<00:02:12.209> pros<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.480> cons

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
a pros and cons

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.060 
a pros and cons
next<00:02:13.630> let's<00:02:13.840> show<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> what<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> looks<00:02:14.920> like

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
next let's show you what it looks like

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:25.890 
next let's show you what it looks like
underwater

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.959
