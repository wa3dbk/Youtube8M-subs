 behind symbian jiménez villaescusa fernández and pisano who 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 they would exchange the positions with the passage of the turns 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.760
 Cesar Fernandez who was marching fourth 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.140

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.019
 the protagonists in the first positions 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.230
 the one that came out better was Cesar Fernandez who managed to lead the race 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.089
 during the first round 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.679
 but Corona did not want to miss the opportunity to be the champion and what 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.529
 exceeded in the second turn 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.529

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.090
 in the first race bartolomé sánchez had no problems winning it 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.270
 from the beginning to the end he led with a lot of authority 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.370
 on the contrary the psoe 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.569

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.279
 Francisco García Lillo fought 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.039
 first positions during the three laps that the sleeve lasted 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.429
 the best of them was lópez ahead of bartolomé sánchez asked to look at the 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.529
 the one of murcia was satisfied with him 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:26.979
 world in this manga 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.180
 the podium was francisco garcía 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.550
 this is the joint classification for these pirates of youth and cadets 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.149
 in the category of this system there were only four participants in the 

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:46.669
 semifinal but that for their quality and good piloting they knew how to give 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.629
 next to all the people gathered there 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.629
 juan ignacio tapia sources 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.050
 they are part of it but finally 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 the mission took the cat to the water getting to win it 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.650
 after several falls josé antonio samper entered second juan ignacio tapia 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.650
 third 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.669
 in this x 2 and concise 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.960
 Carlos Fernández and Daniel Ávila once again demonstrated that they are 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960
 two of the best activity brokers in this specialty 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.130
 during the two hours that it lasts until race will fight to obtain the 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.939
 longed for first position 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.889
 At the beginning of the race, Fernández was over the league 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.119
 he had only three laps to go 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.699
 Ávila got over it and placed himself 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.280
 behind it rolled fabian benedito who endured third all the 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.409
 career 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.129
 after these two semifinals of both categories was played the grand final 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.860
 open that would close this mountain 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.169
 according to almenara 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.139
 during the first laps the race was a bit crazy 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.589
 fernando antero valle 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.080
 the film by daniel ávila ruiz 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.639
 but in the third turn Carlos Fernandez who had started very well what was going 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.900
 rolling fourth I start overtaking all your rivals until you get 

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:03.550
 behind him he would still be there 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.939
 last he did not understand anything 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.699
 and to get up to the 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.249
 lateral and life I wanted to continue 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:10.749
 the heat that makes 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.839
 finally the ranking 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.569
 not only advance it mansilla 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.569
 it also exceeds millions 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.110
 after the dispute of this fx race about 10 buildings 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.620
 that's how the classification will be 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:30.949
 the last test of this season the supercross of the Valencian community 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.240
 will travel to alicante concretely to virgin of the road 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.479
 where the names of the champions of the categories that 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:38.479
 they are still in the air
