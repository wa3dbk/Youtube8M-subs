called status tweak simply that and you

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.660 
called status tweak simply that and you
can<00:00:12.459> find<00:00:12.760> it<00:00:12.910> for<00:00:13.209> $3<00:00:13.959> under<00:00:14.379> the<00:00:14.500> mod<00:00:14.709> my<00:00:14.980> repo

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
can find it for $3 under the mod my repo

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.640 
can find it for $3 under the mod my repo
now<00:00:16.209> I'm<00:00:16.330> not<00:00:16.510> here<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:16.869> argue<00:00:16.900> whether<00:00:17.380> this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
now I'm not here to argue whether this

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.410 
now I'm not here to argue whether this
tweak<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.070> worth<00:00:18.250> three<00:00:18.550> dollars<00:00:18.580> or<00:00:19.150> if<00:00:19.270> it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
tweak is worth three dollars or if it's

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.960 
tweak is worth three dollars or if it's
worth<00:00:19.590> $0.99<00:00:20.590> that's<00:00:21.039> for<00:00:21.249> the<00:00:21.339> developer<00:00:21.849> to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
worth $0.99 that's for the developer to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.079 
worth $0.99 that's for the developer to
choose<00:00:22.269> but<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:23.169> is<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.740> pretty<00:00:24.220> useful<00:00:24.579> tweak

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
choose but it is a pretty useful tweak

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.999 
choose but it is a pretty useful tweak
to<00:00:25.329> sum<00:00:25.599> so<00:00:26.079> if<00:00:26.349> it's<00:00:26.499> worth<00:00:26.710> three<00:00:26.980> dollars

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
to sum so if it's worth three dollars

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.159 
to sum so if it's worth three dollars
for<00:00:27.579> you<00:00:27.699> go<00:00:28.029> ahead<00:00:28.150> and<00:00:28.419> try<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:28.720> out

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
for you go ahead and try it out

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.290 
for you go ahead and try it out
status<00:00:29.829> tweak<00:00:30.070> basically<00:00:30.609> allows<00:00:30.909> you<00:00:31.150> to

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
status tweak basically allows you to

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
you can see it's changed right there

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.600 
you can see it's changed right there
I<00:00:34.810> was<00:00:35.170> actually<00:00:35.470> within<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.800> photos<00:00:36.190> app<00:00:36.400> so

I was actually within the photos app so
it's<00:00:36.760> still<00:00:37.000> changed<00:00:37.449> that<00:00:37.629> was<00:00:37.719> just<00:00:37.930> a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
it's still changed that was just a

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.869 
it's still changed that was just a
screenshot<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.559> my<00:00:38.800> device<00:00:39.100> before<00:00:39.579> I

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
screenshot of my device before I

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.510 
screenshot of my device before I
customized<00:00:40.629> my<00:00:40.870> status<00:00:41.320> bar<00:00:41.350> so<00:00:42.100> we<00:00:42.250> can<00:00:42.399> go

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
customized my status bar so we can go

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.189 
customized my status bar so we can go
right<00:00:42.550> into<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.149> settings<00:00:43.539> you<00:00:43.690> can<00:00:43.840> turn<00:00:44.019> it

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
right into the settings you can turn it

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.110 
right into the settings you can turn it
on<00:00:44.379> or<00:00:44.649> off<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:44.920> can<00:00:45.340> also<00:00:45.489> configure<00:00:45.969> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
on or off you can also configure the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.270 
on or off you can also configure the
layout<00:00:46.570> now<00:00:47.019> this<00:00:47.230> is<00:00:47.379> really<00:00:47.620> simple<00:00:47.890> one

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
layout now this is really simple one

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.830 
layout now this is really simple one
thing<00:00:48.519> that<00:00:48.670> does<00:00:48.910> bother<00:00:49.149> me<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.719> you

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
thing that does bother me is that you

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.509 
thing that does bother me is that you
can't<00:00:50.079> really<00:00:50.289> put<00:00:50.559> anything<00:00:50.859> in<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.219> middle

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
can't really put anything in the middle

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.270 
can't really put anything in the middle
as<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:52.179> would<00:00:52.390> with<00:00:52.719> your<00:00:52.750> time<00:00:53.260> normally<00:00:53.800> but

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
as you would with your time normally but

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.919 
as you would with your time normally but
you<00:00:54.309> can<00:00:54.609> change<00:00:54.820> around<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.269> left<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.719> right

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
you can change around the left and right

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.079 
you can change around the left and right
side<00:00:56.230> hopefully<00:00:56.800> they'll<00:00:57.039> add<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.640> center

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
side hopefully they'll add the center

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.110 
side hopefully they'll add the center
sometime<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.230> future<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.489> we<00:01:00.519> can<00:01:00.969> go

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
sometime in the future so we can go

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.970 
sometime in the future so we can go
ahead<00:01:01.179> and<00:01:01.420> put<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.660> battery<00:01:02.019> percentage<00:01:02.379> on

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
ahead and put the battery percentage on

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.470 
ahead and put the battery percentage on
the<00:01:03.129> other<00:01:03.280> side<00:01:03.579> we'll<00:01:03.820> put<00:01:03.999> it<00:01:04.089> on<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.300> right

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
the other side we'll put it on the right

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.000 
the other side we'll put it on the right
side<00:01:04.750> right<00:01:04.780> there<00:01:05.199> as<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.379> can<00:01:05.680> see<00:01:05.830> it's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
side right there as you can see it's

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.890 
side right there as you can see it's
switched<00:01:06.430> right<00:01:06.730> there<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.480> can<00:01:07.510> go<00:01:07.750> ahead<00:01:07.810> and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
switched right there we can go ahead and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.660 
switched right there we can go ahead and
put<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.290> battery<00:01:08.680> right<00:01:08.920> there<00:01:08.980> and<00:01:09.430> there

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
put the battery right there and there

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.249 
put the battery right there and there
might<00:01:09.880> not<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.180> enough<00:01:10.420> room<00:01:10.689> actually<00:01:11.079> there

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
might not be enough room actually there

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.899 
might not be enough room actually there
is<00:01:11.500> so<00:01:11.979> we<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.340> battery<00:01:12.640> right<00:01:12.850> there

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
is so we have the battery right there

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.929 
is so we have the battery right there
and<00:01:13.360> this<00:01:13.720> is<00:01:13.780> actually<00:01:14.560> my<00:01:14.740> carrier<00:01:15.220> logo<00:01:15.490> not

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
and this is actually my carrier logo not

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.330 
and this is actually my carrier logo not
the<00:01:16.150> date<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.930> date<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.590> set<00:01:18.070> as<00:01:18.310> a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the date the date you can set as a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.850 
the date the date you can set as a
separate<00:01:19.210> option<00:01:19.720> under<00:01:20.140> miscellaneous

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
separate option under miscellaneous

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.380 
separate option under miscellaneous
tweaks<00:01:21.189> which<00:01:21.399> will<00:01:21.579> allow<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.149> change

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
tweaks which will allow you to change

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.020 
tweaks which will allow you to change
the<00:01:22.509> carrier<00:01:23.049> logo<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.070> date<00:01:24.579> of<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the carrier logo to the date of the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.510 
the carrier logo to the date of the
current<00:01:25.299> day<00:01:25.450> you're<00:01:25.630> on<00:01:25.659> obviously<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.189> we

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
current day you're on obviously so we

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.340 
current day you're on obviously so we
can<00:01:27.729> go<00:01:28.000> ahead<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.180> put<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.540> carrier<00:01:28.840> logo<00:01:29.079> on

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
can go ahead and put the carrier logo on

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.440 
can go ahead and put the carrier logo on
the<00:01:29.470> other<00:01:29.619> side<00:01:29.979> change<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.850> battery<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.329> be

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the other side change the battery to be

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.969 
the other side change the battery to be
on<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.750> side<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.229> we<00:01:32.259> have<00:01:32.380> room<00:01:32.680> for<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
on this side so we have room for the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.440 
on this side so we have room for the
carrier<00:01:33.340> logo<00:01:33.549> we'll<00:01:33.909> put<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.180> battery

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
carrier logo we'll put the battery

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.630 
carrier logo we'll put the battery
percentage<00:01:34.990> right<00:01:35.140> here<00:01:35.439> you<00:01:35.860> basically<00:01:36.009> get

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
percentage right here you basically get

switching from 3G to Wi-Fi and here are
the<00:02:16.300> miscellaneous<00:02:16.959> tweaks<00:02:17.349> now<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:17.890> of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the miscellaneous tweaks now a lot of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.960 
the miscellaneous tweaks now a lot of
these<00:02:18.129> are<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:18.400> you

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
these are really you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.640 
these are really you
well<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.690> hide<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.080> a.m.<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:20.590> p.m.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
well you can hide the a.m. or p.m.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.890 
well you can hide the a.m. or p.m.
because<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.550> simply<00:02:21.910> look<00:02:22.150> up<00:02:22.390> or<00:02:22.660> look

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
because you can simply look up or look

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.960 
because you can simply look up or look
outside<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.650> what<00:02:24.130> time<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.400> day<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.880> is

whether it's nighttime or daytime unless

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370 
whether it's nighttime or daytime unless
you<00:02:27.370> live<00:02:27.550> somewhere<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.150> Alaska<00:02:28.750> or

you live somewhere in Alaska or

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.190 
you live somewhere in Alaska or
something<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.910> can<00:02:31.060> also<00:02:31.180> show<00:02:31.840> while

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
something but you can also show while

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.710 
something but you can also show while
locked<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.130> you'll<00:02:33.340> show<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.730> time<00:02:33.970> when<00:02:34.420> it's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
locked so you'll show the time when it's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
locked so you'll show the time when it's
on<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.020> lock<00:02:35.470> screen<00:02:35.500> instead<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.220> showing

that<00:02:36.760> padlock<00:02:37.060> at<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> top<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.440> replace

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that padlock at the top you can replace

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.770 
that padlock at the top you can replace
the<00:02:39.220> carrier<00:02:39.640> name<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.210> date<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.600> you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
the carrier name with the date as you

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.290 
the carrier name with the date as you
can<00:02:40.900> see<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.170> switches<00:02:41.560> back<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.920> AT&amp;T<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.760> now

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
can see it switches back to AT&amp;T and now

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.510 
can see it switches back to AT&amp;T and now
it<00:02:43.450> switches<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.110> date<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.100> hide<00:02:45.280> the

it switches to the date you can hide the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.040 
it switches to the date you can hide the
year<00:02:45.790> if<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.600> need<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.900> know
