00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.850
 and then who knows what the bial on 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.849
 racism here with samsung galaxy note 8 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.219
 and samsung galaxy s four will do 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.590
 here is an antuã performance test 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 It's okay to mark what I decide. 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 do with both of you could have done 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.910
 before but only now came the idea because 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 this is a quad core 1.6 that this is 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.289
 1.8 core quad is personal 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 So we'll do the test of the gift. 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.649
 antônio 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.829
 Come on, let's get him out here. I hung up. 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.280
 all power-saving parts 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.890
 This reflects on the performance of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 Let's go there reminding staff that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 the ocean processor of each is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 different graphics processor is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.170
 different 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.280
 ok this is a point that is 84 rope 1.8 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 a code code 1.6 or 4g is a quad 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.640
 core 1.8 or 3g 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.640
 it has two quad-core processors and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 one point I think while 31.7 if not 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.049
 I'm wrong but they do not work both 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 at the same time 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 when it requires a little more 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 performance he goes to the other 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 processor and the other it stops 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 to function 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 already that 4g not it is a run-run 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.439
 works all at the same time as well as 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 note 8 o s4 tvi clearly that there is a 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.659
 A little ahead, come on, I have one. 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.930
 I'll show the score 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.060
 may have given more can give one more can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.170
 give less than the previous test and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.899
 those who depend on programs that are 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.060
 running in memory and everything else this is the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.520
 Air I do not restart it I already started 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 well testing with is just to see how 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 that will stay the score and then to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
 you have an idea more or less and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 how was the score of each in his 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 historical okay I generally I do not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050
 uninstalled and if these programs 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.250
 because I find it interesting that when 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.050
 he gets a new version of it until 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.090
 is a new version of android for example 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.450
 from 4.1.2 going to 422 oprah 4,301 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.100
 Rolling back here to talk, is not it? 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.710
 there is a performance gain in the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.920
 This is very cool device. 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.780
 different from that of the apple line 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.790
 example when he launched a system 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.560
 operating again the old appliances 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.570
 they are getting lagged 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 they will slow down and if not 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.610
 It seems that the street she makes a process 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.120
 Conversely she can still improve 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.090
 more so the performance battery 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.250
 Yeah, but nothing against apple myself. 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.120
 I really like apple 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.190
 okay but it's what follows the pattern of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 apple is this for example today we 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.030
 are a standard 7 s7 in a little while the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.090
 most likely or other version of the system 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.810
 probably operating on 8 iphone 4 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.630
 no longer behave more this version 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.030
 we clearly see that s4 is very 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.760
 faster in different graphic part 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.209
 do not 8 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:31.610
 here beats 15 ali bark 40 fps staff is 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:35.600
 much difference even here 2138 fps is 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.049
 Ending here, it's over. 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:47.720
 dodô that the other one is loading here 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:54.650
 he made 20020 1922 and this one and onenote 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:57.110
 3 he did 29,374 that same still has the 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 others here, better performance has the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:06.769
 note 3 or the xperia say another o'shea 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.660
 xiaoshan mm3 or lg 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.970
 the mg2 is there and so on we have 11 and 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.860
 s4 which is what is here just below the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.799
 is more or less where 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.739
 even slightly above 1 s4 should be oo 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.460
 cornea dj oxy 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.620
 we were here in detail here 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.660
 punctuation 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.610
 where it 's like that he left the flowerbed every 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.630
 one that was previously tested is 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.520
 we have here the history that we have here 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.400
 historic 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:47.930
 this was the current historical test 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:51.250
 previous 20,490 20 thousand 20,490 20,922 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:57.530
 gain a little bit the previous test 28 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:59.990
 1586 the test now 29.374 or is there 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.030
 a performance gain and I did not move 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.490
 personal in your home did nothing 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.140
 the only thing different is different from 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.850
 Only thing I did was call now. 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.830
 was running the programs 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:17.860
 I want to see here and here more info from 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.860
 varzim let's go guys here 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:28.550
 he is with a bath here is 4.1 4,341 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:31.220
 cup decó 15 not serve notw 8 and if 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.190
 another that he does not speak what is the 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.760
 processor I can not remember which 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:45.590
 adriano for s4 a ali pro o samsung 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:50.420
 here we go, the quad core quad core 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.010
 only to a point 91.8 91.9 and 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.820
 1.6 I said it was a point or another 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.490
 but it 's a personal 9 point but we have 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:03.020
 here is the resolution of your 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.100
 problems at 80.080 per 1091 1920 and 1080p 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.520
 full hd 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.580
 here is 4.9 megapixel HD resolution and 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.960
 5-megapixel camera of 12.8 or 3 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.970
 megapixels and personal camera android 4.3 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.430
 here and 4.1.2 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.010
 and the sensors here have practically 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.060
 all the time and temperature for the s4 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.820
 Here they are missing several have ingression 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.260
 proximity light and compass for the 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.620
 onenote 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.330
 so we see that really o s4 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.590
 he is 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.949
 much faster than the last 8 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.289
 in the theater, it's not ugly, not 20,922 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.909
 very good score also gives right 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.110
 personnel so it is the comparison between 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:54.340
 samsung galaxy s 4 and the galaxy note 8 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.990
 next to their processors 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.300
 It's good if you liked it yet. 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.810
 left a thank you note and see you later 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.810
 folks
