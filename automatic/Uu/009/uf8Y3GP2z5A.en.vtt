00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:07.990 

hiren<00:00:58.650> cranking<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.250> this<00:01:01.760> tensioner

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.950 

that's<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> go

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you just take this coil off nest is held

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
you just take this coil off nest is held
on<00:01:20.520> by<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.760> couple<00:01:20.880> bolts<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.720> sue<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
on by a couple bolts right there sue is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
on by a couple bolts right there sue is
a<00:01:22.290> good<00:01:22.440> idea<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.920> under<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.430> battery<00:01:23.760> on

has spring to it I can operate it with a
little<00:02:59.650> wrench<00:02:59.859> if<00:03:00.370> we<00:03:00.519> go<00:03:00.670> back<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.880> my<00:03:01.090> water

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
little wrench if we go back to my water

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.940 
little wrench if we go back to my water
pump<00:03:01.540> video<00:03:01.840> you'll<00:03:02.139> see<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> Helen<00:03:02.799> was

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
pump video you'll see that the Helen was

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.069 
pump video you'll see that the Helen was
actually<00:03:03.850> bad<00:03:04.030> way<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.049> was

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
actually bad way back then and it was

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.979 
actually bad way back then and it was
it's<00:03:05.620> kind<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.829> freezing<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.370> position<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> I

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
it's kind of freezing in position so I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's kind of freezing in position so I
just<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.100> forced<00:03:09.459> some<00:03:09.579> tension<00:03:09.880> on<00:03:10.000> it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
just kind of forced some tension on it

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.780 
just kind of forced some tension on it
would<00:03:10.389> just<00:03:10.540> stay<00:03:11.049> there<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:12.609> we'll<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:12.760> ahead

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
would just stay there so we'll go ahead

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
would just stay there so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:12.910> put<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.180> belt<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.600> now

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.620 

and<00:03:24.069> there<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.580> have<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:25.090> make<00:03:25.239> sure<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.540> in

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and there you have it make sure it's in

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.830 
and there you have it make sure it's in
all<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.780> grooves<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> pulleys<00:03:26.980> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
all the grooves and all the pulleys and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
all the grooves and all the pulleys and
should<00:03:28.840> be<00:03:28.930> good<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.170> go<00:03:29.200> we'll<00:03:29.650> try<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.830> little

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
should be good to go we'll try a little

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:39.900 
should be good to go we'll try a little
startup<00:03:30.370> here<00:03:36.420> nice<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.450> quiet
