00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
gotten a rollcage on it
and<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:20.600> right<00:03:21.600> here<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:23.040> see

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
and if you can see right here you see

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.220 
and if you can see right here you see
the<00:03:23.430> transmission<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> covers

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the transmission you can see the covers

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.350 
the transmission you can see the covers
where<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> PTA<00:03:25.770> would<00:03:25.980> win<00:03:26.300> lot<00:03:27.300> of

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
where the PTA would win lot of

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.900 
where the PTA would win lot of
industrial<00:03:27.890> tractors<00:03:28.890> they<00:03:29.070> cover<00:03:29.580> all<00:03:29.640> that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
industrial tractors they cover all that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.140 
industrial tractors they cover all that
up

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
up

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.690 
up
PTO<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.480> I'm<00:03:33.720> guessing<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.200> might<00:03:34.980> be<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> 444

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
PTO so I'm guessing this might be a 444

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.930 
PTO so I'm guessing this might be a 444
544<00:03:38.700> somewhere<00:03:39.210> around<00:03:39.270> there<00:03:43.610> I'm<00:03:44.610> not<00:03:44.760> sure

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
544 somewhere around there I'm not sure

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.730 
544 somewhere around there I'm not sure
what<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.300> think<00:03:45.330> outriggers<00:03:46.260> might<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.530> leaking

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
what I think outriggers might be leaking

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.110 
what I think outriggers might be leaking
down<00:03:47.010> that's<00:03:47.190> why<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> got<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.550> chained<00:03:47.910> up

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
down that's why you got to chained up

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.100 
down that's why you got to chained up
maybe<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:49.850> don't<00:03:50.850> really<00:03:51.120> see<00:03:51.360> me<00:03:51.480> scoring<00:03:51.840> on

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
maybe but don't really see me scoring on

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.610 
maybe but don't really see me scoring on
any<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.560> cylinders<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.900> tail

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.680 

like<00:03:59.160> it's<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> little

working on strong with ones they got now

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.270 
working on strong with ones they got now
