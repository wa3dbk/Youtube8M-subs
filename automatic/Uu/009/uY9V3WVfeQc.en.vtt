this<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:11.239> useful<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.440> design

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
this is really useful in this design

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.080 
this is really useful in this design

pocket you will not feel the difference

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.640 
pocket you will not feel the difference
between<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> standard<00:02:22.640> cover<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.989> battery

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650

and this extended battery and extended

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.600 
and this extended battery and extended
color<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:30.620> mention<00:02:30.769> only<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.630> hole<00:02:32.630> for

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
color I can mention only this hole for

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.839 
color I can mention only this hole for
the<00:02:34.610> speaker<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:36.170> tell<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.220> sound<00:02:37.489> is

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
the speaker I can tell that the sound is

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.080 
the speaker I can tell that the sound is
a<00:02:38.330> little<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.870> muted<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:40.190> will<00:02:40.370> not<00:02:40.670> hear

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
a little bit muted but you will not hear

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.600 
a little bit muted but you will not hear
the<00:02:41.209> difference<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:43.040> really<00:02:43.459> good

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
the difference so it's it's really good

thing<00:05:49.610> about<00:05:49.850> lithium-ion<00:05:50.800> batteries<00:05:51.800> is

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
thing about lithium-ion batteries is

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.330 
thing about lithium-ion batteries is
that<00:05:52.639> when<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:53.720> charge<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:54.110> up<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.800> 100

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
that when you charge it up to the 100

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.050 
that when you charge it up to the 100
percent<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.910> overcharge<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:57.460> it<00:05:58.460> will<00:05:58.820> last

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
percent and overcharge it it will last

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.469 
percent and overcharge it it will last
much<00:05:59.510> longer<00:05:59.570> because<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:01.060> 6,000<00:06:02.060> milli

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
much longer because the 6,000 milli

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.930 
much longer because the 6,000 milli
amperes<00:06:02.810> that<00:06:02.990> has<00:06:03.169> this<00:06:03.350> capacity<00:06:03.700> that<00:06:04.700> has

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
amperes that has this capacity that has

amperes that has this capacity that has
