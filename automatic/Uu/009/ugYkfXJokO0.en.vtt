fibers<00:00:40.090> if<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.210> look<00:00:41.360> after<00:00:41.540> them<00:00:41.810> they'll

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
fibers if you look after them they'll

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.320 
fibers if you look after them they'll
last<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.380> quite<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.590> while<00:00:42.770> though<00:00:42.980> and

last for quite a while though and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.490 
last for quite a while though and
they're<00:00:44.330> really<00:00:44.480> good<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.870> use<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.470> can

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
they're really good to use you can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.650 
they're really good to use you can
spread<00:00:45.920> them<00:00:46.100> out<00:00:46.160> like<00:00:46.400> this<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:47.300> keep<00:00:47.540> them

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
spread them out like this and keep them

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.060 
spread them out like this and keep them
tight<00:00:47.900> like<00:00:48.080> them<00:00:48.230> they<00:00:48.530> were<00:00:48.620> before<00:00:48.890> and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
tight like them they were before and

this<00:00:49.610> is<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:50.330> image<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.050> I'm<00:00:51.350> going<00:00:51.560> to<00:00:51.620> do

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
this is the image that I'm going to do

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.450 
this is the image that I'm going to do
what<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:52.879> did<00:00:53.080> when<00:00:54.080> you<00:00:54.170> load<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.770> brush<00:00:55.160> head

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
what I did when you load the brush head

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.260 
what I did when you load the brush head
just<00:00:56.059> lay<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.570> down<00:00:56.629> into<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.170> wax<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.770> then

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
just lay it down into the wax and then

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.240 
just lay it down into the wax and then
sort<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.360> shuffle<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.559> lay<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.070> into

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
sort of shuffle it so just lay it into

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.190 
sort of shuffle it so just lay it into
the<00:01:01.340> wax<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.850> then<00:01:01.940> shuffle<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.450> off<00:01:02.600> onto<00:01:02.900> the

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
the wax and then shuffle it off onto the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.290 
the wax and then shuffle it off onto the
the<00:01:03.470> card<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:04.339> you're<00:01:04.550> sort<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.820> scribbling

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
the card like you're sort of scribbling

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.450 
the card like you're sort of scribbling
backwards<00:01:06.080> with<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.350> or<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.010> can<00:01:07.190> use<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
backwards with it or you can use the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.630 
backwards with it or you can use the
back<00:01:07.640> heel<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.110> it's<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.770> safer<00:01:10.460> way

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
back heel like this and it's a safer way

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.109 
back heel like this and it's a safer way
what<00:01:11.180> not<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.600> do<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.960> stab<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.970> front<00:01:13.970> of

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
what not to do is to stab the front of

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.969 
what not to do is to stab the front of
the<00:01:14.240> brush<00:01:14.450> into<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> wax<00:01:15.440> because<00:01:15.710> you'll

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the brush into the wax because you'll

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.760 
the brush into the wax because you'll
just<00:01:16.009> tangle<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.759> fibers<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.619> see

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
just tangle the fibers and you can see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.460 
just tangle the fibers and you can see
it's<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> bit<00:01:19.100> like<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.250> wet<00:01:19.490> brush<00:01:20.170> which<00:01:21.170> leaves

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
it's a bit like a wet brush which leaves

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's a bit like a wet brush which leaves
nice<00:01:21.830> textures<00:01:22.399> once<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.850> wax<00:01:22.940> cools<00:01:23.240> down

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
nice textures once the wax cools down

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.730 
nice textures once the wax cools down
changing<00:01:25.460> colors<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:25.940> can<00:01:26.530> clean<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.710> between

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
changing colors you can clean in between

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.150 
changing colors you can clean in between
or<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:29.000> don't<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:30.950> just

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
or you don't have to and then just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.499 
or you don't have to and then just
laying<00:01:31.369> on<00:01:31.550> top<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.479> wax<00:01:32.600> or<00:01:34.420> onto<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
laying on top of the wax or onto the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.139 
laying on top of the wax or onto the
card<00:01:35.750> itself<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.950> here<00:01:37.729> what<00:01:37.910> i'm<00:01:38.000> actually

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
card itself and here what i'm actually

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.029 
card itself and here what i'm actually
doing<00:01:38.300> stop<00:01:38.690> putting<00:01:38.960> more<00:01:39.200> wax<00:01:39.410> on<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:39.860> just

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
doing stop putting more wax on but just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.710 
doing stop putting more wax on but just
spreading<00:01:40.459> out<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:41.060> wax<00:01:41.209> that's<00:01:41.479> already

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
spreading out the wax that's already

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.400 
spreading out the wax that's already
there

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
there

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.249 
there
so<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.100> can<00:01:43.459> blend<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.450> colors<00:01:44.690> together<00:01:44.840> if

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
so you can blend the colors together if

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.169 
so you can blend the colors together if
you<00:01:45.410> notice<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.890> blue<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.459> the<00:01:46.640> yellow<00:01:46.670> makes

off the tip again if it gets out of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300 
shape just use the tissue as a pad and
bend<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.970> back<00:02:17.180> into<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.510> shape<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.900> want<00:02:18.310> now

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
bend it back into the shape you want now

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.980 
bend it back into the shape you want now
you<00:02:19.370> can<00:02:19.520> put<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.760> stronger<00:02:20.120> color<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.780> can

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
you can put in stronger color you can

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.410 
you can put in stronger color you can
put<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.290> lighter<00:02:21.500> color<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.060> make<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
put in lighter color you can make the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.330 
put in lighter color you can make the
waxes<00:02:23.870> wetter<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:24.709> wax<00:02:24.920> there<00:02:25.190> is

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
waxes wetter the more wax there is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.339 
waxes wetter the more wax there is
present<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.300> wetter<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.900> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.230> be

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
present then the wetter is going to be

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.910 
present then the wetter is going to be
and<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:29.240> just<00:02:29.270> working<00:02:29.630> away<00:02:29.990> all<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and so I'm just working away all the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.720 
and so I'm just working away all the
time<00:02:31.569> looking<00:02:32.569> at<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.709> image<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.220> develops

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
time looking at the image as it develops

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.290 
time looking at the image as it develops
and<00:02:35.660> I'm<00:02:35.780> staying<00:02:36.080> with<00:02:36.459> yellow<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.610> blue<00:02:38.150> as

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
and I'm staying with yellow and blue as

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.760 
and I'm staying with yellow and blue as
primaries<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.050> then<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.440> green<00:02:39.739> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
primaries and then a bit of green and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.430 
primaries and then a bit of green and
some<00:02:40.220> white<00:02:40.459> pasty<00:02:40.940> colors<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.290> I'm

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
some white pasty colors and as I'm

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.350 
some white pasty colors and as I'm
working<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.860> screen<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.489> noticed<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
working the screen in I noticed that the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.560 
working the screen in I noticed that the
strokes<00:02:44.660> were<00:02:44.840> getting<00:02:45.140> larger<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.650> larger

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
strokes were getting larger and larger

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.420 
strokes were getting larger and larger
so<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:47.990> textures<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.710> using<00:02:49.310> this

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so you can put textures in using this

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.910 
so you can put textures in using this
brush

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
brush

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800 
brush
it's<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.520> quite<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> versatile<00:02:51.180> tool<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it's really quite a versatile tool and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
it's really quite a versatile tool and
you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> get<00:02:52.830> very<00:02:52.860> fine<00:02:53.280> blends<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.819> well

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you can get very fine blends as well

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
you can get very fine blends as well
also<00:02:54.720> when<00:02:55.050> you're<00:02:55.200> loading<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.530> brush<00:02:55.770> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
also when you're loading the brush you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.160 
also when you're loading the brush you
can<00:02:56.160> change<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.060> shape<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.630> tip<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:58.050> you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
can change the shape of the tip if you

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.800 
can change the shape of the tip if you
find<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.620> you've<00:02:58.910> bent<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.120> by<00:03:00.330> pressing<00:03:00.540> too

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
find that you've bent it by pressing too

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.229 
find that you've bent it by pressing too
hard<00:03:04.190> colors<00:03:05.190> don't<00:03:05.340> always<00:03:05.610> come<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
hard colors don't always come out the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.880 
hard colors don't always come out the
color<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.020> think<00:03:07.319> they're<00:03:07.500> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.800> be

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
color that you think they're going to be

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.410 
color that you think they're going to be
like<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.310> blue<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> gone<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> bit<00:03:09.150> murky

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
like this blue is gone a bit murky

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.030 
like this blue is gone a bit murky
because<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:10.110> mixing<00:03:10.620> with<00:03:10.770> all<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
because it's mixing with all the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
because it's mixing with all the
clusters<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.550> already<00:03:11.850> there<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.480> as<00:03:13.470> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
clusters are already there and so as you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
clusters are already there and so as you
can<00:03:13.650> see<00:03:13.830> at<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.950> bottom<00:03:14.100> here<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.819> needed<00:03:15.090> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
can see at the bottom here it needed a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150 
can see at the bottom here it needed a
bit<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.300> work<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.959> took<00:03:16.019> some<00:03:16.350> yellow<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.890> I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
bit of work so I took some yellow and I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.790 
bit of work so I took some yellow and I
just<00:03:17.430> worked<00:03:17.730> through<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> now<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.530> think

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
just worked through it now if you think

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.140 
just worked through it now if you think
about<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> amount<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.430> wax<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:20.880> here

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
about the amount of wax that's here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.090 
about the amount of wax that's here
there's<00:03:21.420> quite<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.410> I'm<00:03:22.530> working<00:03:22.800> much

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
there's quite a bit so I'm working much

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.850 
there's quite a bit so I'm working much
more<00:03:23.130> slowly<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.450> I'm<00:03:24.630> sort<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.959> probing<00:03:25.650> my

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
more slowly and I'm sort of probing my

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.229 
more slowly and I'm sort of probing my
way<00:03:26.010> forward<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:27.360> I'm<00:03:27.450> melting<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.230> and

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
way forward so I'm melting and and

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.970 
way forward so I'm melting and and
barging<00:03:30.239> pushing<00:03:30.630> into<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.260> wax<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.920> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
barging pushing into the wax and it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.770 
barging pushing into the wax and it
created<00:03:32.250> lovely<00:03:32.549> lines<00:03:32.850> which<00:03:33.330> when<00:03:33.690> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
created lovely lines which when you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.059 
created lovely lines which when you
looked<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.140> close<00:03:34.530> were<00:03:34.830> quite

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
looked really close were quite

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.910 
looked really close were quite
interesting<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:36.140> can<00:03:37.140> take<00:03:37.380> color<00:03:37.620> off<00:03:37.769> as

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
interesting you can take color off as

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.340 
interesting you can take color off as
well<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.430> use<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.209> brush<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> mop

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
well just use the brush to to the mop

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.020 
well just use the brush to to the mop
the<00:03:40.470> color<00:03:40.680> up<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.069> then<00:03:41.190> wipe<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.700> clean

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the color up and then wipe it out clean

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.970 
the color up and then wipe it out clean
so<00:03:42.299> I've<00:03:42.510> got<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:42.750> fast<00:03:43.049> tightened<00:03:43.620> time<00:03:43.830> for

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
so I've got this fast tightened time for

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.660 
so I've got this fast tightened time for
some<00:03:44.160> stronger<00:03:44.580> contrast<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:47.489> going

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
some stronger contrast and that's going

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.220 
some stronger contrast and that's going
to<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.819> little<00:03:48.000> tree<00:03:48.330> at<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.510> top<00:03:48.540> there<00:03:48.930> so

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
to be a little tree at the top there so

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.440 
to be a little tree at the top there so
I<00:03:49.470> decided<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.130> I'd<00:03:50.400> put<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.970> some<00:03:51.180> dark

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
I decided that I'd put in some dark

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.449 
I decided that I'd put in some dark
color<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.230> make<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.680> quite<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.920> striking

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
color and make it quite a striking

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.110 
color and make it quite a striking
feature<00:03:53.760> as<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.329> was<00:03:54.420> going<00:03:54.570> along<00:03:55.549> in<00:03:56.549> fact

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
feature as I was going along in fact

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120 
feature as I was going along in fact
it's<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.329> focal<00:03:57.690> point<00:03:57.989> really<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.500> then

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
it's the focal point really and then

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.360 
it's the focal point really and then
blend<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.579> in<00:03:59.959> now<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.470> smoke<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:02.220> can

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
blend it in now the smoke that you can

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.310 
blend it in now the smoke that you can
see<00:04:02.640> here<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.989> tried<00:04:04.290> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
see here if you can see it I tried to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.039 
see here if you can see it I tried to
show<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.890> because<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.510> tip<00:04:06.810> is

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
show it is because the the tip is

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.960 
show it is because the the tip is
getting<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.380> bit<00:04:07.530> hot<00:04:07.799> when<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> use<00:04:08.489> just<00:04:08.820> the

getting a bit hot when you use just the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030 
getting a bit hot when you use just the
small<00:04:09.299> tips<00:04:09.630> they<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:10.140> get<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.560> hot<00:04:10.769> so

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
small tips they can get a bit hot so

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.420 
small tips they can get a bit hot so
just<00:04:11.670> click<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.870> power<00:04:13.079> off<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.680> then

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
and I'm using a little bit of blue on

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.890 
and I'm using a little bit of blue on
the<00:04:22.190> brush<00:04:22.460> head<00:04:22.669> here<00:04:22.940> just<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.419> put<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.750> a

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900

thin<00:04:24.350> line<00:04:24.620> just<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.949> sort<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.250> pick<00:04:25.639> up<00:04:25.759> a<00:04:25.880> bit

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
thin line just to sort of pick up a bit

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.210 
thin line just to sort of pick up a bit
of<00:04:26.090> highlight<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.110> realized<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.620> was<00:04:27.680> now

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220

getting<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.580> bit<00:04:28.699> too<00:04:28.850> cool<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.690> switched<00:04:30.080> her

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
getting a bit too cool so I switched her

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.439 
getting a bit too cool so I switched her
back<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.979> also<00:04:31.039> bending<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.150> brush

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
back on and also bending the the brush

back on and also bending the the brush
into<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.229> particular<00:04:33.770> shape<00:04:34.130> which<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:35.000> small

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
into a particular shape which is a small

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.010 
into a particular shape which is a small
flat<00:04:36.259> brush<00:04:36.860> line<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:38.509> this<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.750> great<00:04:38.930> for

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
flat brush line and this is great for

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.170 
flat brush line and this is great for
putting<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.380> posts<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:39.919> in<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.699> little<00:04:40.940> land

escape<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.870> had<00:04:42.500> lots<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.830> pockets<00:04:43.310> of

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
escape I had lots of pockets of

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.969 
escape I had lots of pockets of
different<00:04:44.090> types<00:04:44.389> of<00:04:44.539> landscapes<00:04:45.229> this<00:04:45.710> is

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
different types of landscapes this is

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.249 
different types of landscapes this is
taking<00:04:46.759> half<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.330> brush<00:04:47.509> out<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.870> way<00:04:47.990> so

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
taking half of the brush out the way so

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.230 
taking half of the brush out the way so
you<00:04:48.470> can<00:04:48.620> get<00:04:48.860> very<00:04:48.889> fine<00:04:49.280> results<00:04:49.759> now<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:49.970> did

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
you can get very fine results now I did

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240 
you can get very fine results now I did
a<00:04:50.270> useless<00:04:50.720> job<00:04:51.139> on<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.680> didn't<00:04:52.039> do<00:04:52.160> it

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
a useless job on this I didn't do it

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.610 
a useless job on this I didn't do it
very<00:04:52.340> well<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:53.570> can<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:54.020> very<00:04:54.410> fine

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
very well but you can get very fine

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.980 
very well but you can get very fine
results<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:56.000> another<00:04:56.300> way<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.509> using<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
results and another way of using the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.839 
results and another way of using the
brush<00:04:57.199> is<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.530> actually<00:04:57.650> take<00:04:57.949> colour<00:04:58.220> off<00:04:58.460> so

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
brush is to actually take colour off so

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.310 
brush is to actually take colour off so
he<00:04:59.210> just<00:04:59.419> art<00:04:59.630> with<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.900> tip<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.199> brush

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
he just art with the tip of the brush

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.140 
he just art with the tip of the brush
and<00:05:00.440> then<00:05:00.740> dab<00:05:00.979> with<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.220> piece<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.550> tissue<00:05:01.729> and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
and then dab with a piece of tissue and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.480 
and then dab with a piece of tissue and
this<00:05:02.509> means<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:02.810> can<00:05:03.020> put<00:05:03.139> clean<00:05:03.500> color<00:05:03.860> back

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
this means you can put clean color back

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.240 
this means you can put clean color back
onto<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.000> surface<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.660> card<00:05:06.250> another

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
onto the surface of the card another

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.680 
onto the surface of the card another
thing<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.520> can<00:05:07.669> do<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:07.940> spread<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.360> brushes

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
thing you can do is spread the brushes

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.629 
thing you can do is spread the brushes
out<00:05:08.870> very<00:05:09.229> very<00:05:09.470> thinly<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.400> wires

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
out very very thinly so that the wires

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.180 
out very very thinly so that the wires
are<00:05:10.880> almost<00:05:11.150> individual<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.800> need<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.099> be

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
are almost individual you need to be

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.279 
are almost individual you need to be

this<00:05:56.210> is<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.479> American<00:05:56.900> one<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.229> that's

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
this is the American one and that's

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.100 
this is the American one and that's
slightly<00:05:58.099> different<00:05:58.669> because<00:05:58.970> although<00:05:59.870> it

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
slightly different because although it

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.960 
slightly different because although it
has<00:06:00.259> a<00:06:00.289> drawing<00:06:00.650> tip<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.039> the<00:06:01.099> brush<00:06:01.280> head<00:06:01.520> it

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
has a drawing tip and the brush head it

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.570 
has a drawing tip and the brush head it
has<00:06:02.150> a<00:06:02.180> screw<00:06:02.630> in<00:06:02.780> fitting<00:06:03.259> rather<00:06:04.070> than<00:06:04.400> the

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
has a screw in fitting rather than the

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.439 
has a screw in fitting rather than the
drop-in<00:06:04.909> fitting<00:06:06.699> so<00:06:07.699> there<00:06:07.940> are<00:06:08.060> different

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
drop-in fitting so there are different

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.490 
drop-in fitting so there are different
tips<00:06:08.720> available<00:06:08.870> as<00:06:09.320> well

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500
