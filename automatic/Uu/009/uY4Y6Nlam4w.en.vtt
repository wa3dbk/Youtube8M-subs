AAA I'm very confident of that and how
many<00:00:06.620> we<00:00:06.800> expected<00:00:07.160> to<00:00:07.220> be<00:00:07.340> then

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
many we expected to be then

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.509 
many we expected to be then

we're<00:00:12.230> we're<00:00:12.679> building<00:00:12.950> two<00:00:13.070> airplanes<00:00:13.490> a

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
we're we're building two airplanes a

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
we do go up and rate or something we can

Carolina away from your your main
production<00:00:36.649> base<00:00:36.949> yeah<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:37.670> were<00:00:37.789> very

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999 
production base yeah we were very

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.200 
production base yeah we were very
surprised<00:00:38.420> by<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.749> NR<00:00:39.109> NLRB<00:00:39.980> ruling<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:41.059> our

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
surprised by the NR NLRB ruling in our

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.180 
surprised by the NR NLRB ruling in our
view<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.719> not<00:00:42.230> consistent<00:00:42.589> flawed<00:00:43.010> it

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
view it is not consistent flawed it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.290 
view it is not consistent flawed it
certainly<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.579> not<00:00:43.699> consistent<00:00:43.760> with

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
certainly is not consistent with

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000 
certainly is not consistent with
precedent<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.499> I'm<00:00:45.620> gonna<00:00:45.769> let<00:00:45.859> our

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
precedent but I'm gonna let our

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.410 
precedent but I'm gonna let our
attorneys<00:00:46.069> take<00:00:46.550> care<00:00:46.760> of<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.269> know<00:00:47.329> I'm

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
will be a replacement for the 737 you're

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.340 
will be a replacement for the 737 you're
sort<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.609> single<00:00:58.940> aisle<00:00:59.149> workhorse<00:00:59.659> will<00:01:00.229> it

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
sort of single aisle workhorse will it

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.229 
sort of single aisle workhorse will it
be<00:01:00.440> just<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.800> an<00:01:01.129> upgraded<00:01:01.489> version<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:02.089> that

be just a an upgraded version of that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.939 
be just a an upgraded version of that
and<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.719> lot<00:01:02.839> of<00:01:02.899> airlines<00:01:03.530> are<00:01:03.679> saying<00:01:03.829> they're

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
and a lot of airlines are saying they're

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.469 
and a lot of airlines are saying they're
desperate<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.759> know<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.969> answer<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.329> this

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
desperate to know the answer to this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.300 
desperate to know the answer to this
well<00:01:05.960> we're<00:01:06.110> looking<00:01:06.229> at<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.500> market<00:01:06.860> we're

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
well we're looking at the market we're

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.039 
well we're looking at the market we're
talking<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.729> our<00:01:07.820> customers<00:01:08.299> we're

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
talking to our customers we're

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.020 
talking to our customers we're
understanding<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.619> technology<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.369> we

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
understanding the technology and we

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.550 
understanding the technology and we
could<00:01:11.329> do<00:01:11.540> either<00:01:11.750> one<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:11.990> those<00:01:12.170> two<00:01:12.380> options

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
could do either one of those two options

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.219 
could do either one of those two options
we<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> design<00:01:14.149> for<00:01:14.450> rienne<00:01:14.719> Jennison<00:01:15.170> on

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
we have a design for rienne Jennison on

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.840 
we have a design for rienne Jennison on
the<00:01:15.320> shelf<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:15.860> that's<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.130> low-risk<00:01:16.430> approach

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the shelf and that's a low-risk approach

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.910 
the shelf and that's a low-risk approach
is<00:01:17.090> taking<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.539> very<00:01:18.110> good<00:01:18.320> airplane<00:01:18.710> and

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
is taking a very good airplane and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.010 
is taking a very good airplane and
making<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.219> better<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.610> more<00:01:20.299> fuel-efficient

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
making it better and more fuel-efficient

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.359 
making it better and more fuel-efficient
we're<00:01:21.140> more<00:01:21.469> fuel<00:01:21.710> efficient<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.219> other

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
we're more fuel efficient the other

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.800 
we're more fuel efficient the other
approach<00:01:22.700> though<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:22.969> think<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.539> one<00:01:23.689> that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
approach though I think is the one that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.359 
approach though I think is the one that
our<00:01:23.960> customers<00:01:24.380> really<00:01:24.560> want<00:01:24.860> us<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.159> do

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
our customers really want us to do

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.310 
our customers really want us to do
they've<00:01:26.119> got<00:01:26.299> issues<00:01:26.450> with<00:01:26.659> profitability

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
they've got issues with profitability

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.560 
they've got issues with profitability
with<00:01:27.770> fuel<00:01:28.039> prices<00:01:28.180> their<00:01:29.180> environmental

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
with fuel prices their environmental

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.599 
with fuel prices their environmental
footprint<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:31.009> build<00:01:31.250> an<00:01:31.340> airplane

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
footprint and we can build an airplane

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.840 
footprint and we can build an airplane
is<00:01:31.850> 20%<00:01:32.479> more<00:01:32.600> efficient<00:01:33.079> than<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.009> 737

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
is 20% more efficient than the the 737

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.630 
is 20% more efficient than the the 737
that's<00:01:35.210> higher<00:01:35.450> risk<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.170> right<00:01:37.009> now<00:01:37.189> we're

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's higher risk and right now we're

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.090 
that's higher risk and right now we're
taking<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:38.090> very<00:01:38.719> cautious<00:01:39.259> approach<00:01:39.649> we're

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
taking a very cautious approach we're

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.889 
taking a very cautious approach we're
trying<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.369> understand<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.600> all<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
trying to understand in all the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.419 
trying to understand in all the
variables<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.649> we'll<00:01:43.100> make<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> decision

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
variables and we'll make a decision

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.399 
variables and we'll make a decision
probably<00:01:44.090> towards<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.420> end<00:01:44.509> of<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:44.719> year<00:01:44.990> if

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
probably towards the end of this year if

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.289 
probably towards the end of this year if
it's<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.710> newer<00:01:45.979> plane<00:01:46.340> than<00:01:46.609> it's<00:01:46.759> not<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.119> what

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
it's a newer plane than it's not so what

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.999 
it's a newer plane than it's not so what
2020<00:01:47.929> that<00:01:48.049> we<00:01:48.170> would<00:01:48.320> see<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.679> replacement

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
2020 that we would see that replacement

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.849 
2020 that we would see that replacement
for<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.340> 2019<00:01:50.090> 2020<00:01:50.299> correct<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
for the 2019 2020 correct and the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.410 
for the 2019 2020 correct and the
airlines<00:01:52.130> are<00:01:52.280> patients<00:01:52.909> waiting<00:01:53.119> for<00:01:53.359> that

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
airlines are patients waiting for that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.310 
airlines are patients waiting for that
because<00:01:53.659> I've<00:01:53.750> been<00:01:53.840> obviously<00:01:54.200> we're

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
because I've been obviously we're

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.380 
because I've been obviously we're
talking<00:01:54.380> about<00:01:54.619> fuel<00:01:54.799> prices<00:01:54.979> now<00:01:55.359> well<00:01:56.359> I

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
talking about fuel prices now well I

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.599 
talking about fuel prices now well I
think<00:01:56.509> they<00:01:56.780> are<00:01:56.929> I<00:01:57.170> mean<00:01:57.499> their<00:01:57.829> option<00:01:58.219> is<00:01:58.399> to

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
think they are I mean their option is to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.760 
think they are I mean their option is to
continue<00:01:59.030> with<00:01:59.179> us<00:01:59.299> on<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.630> 737<00:01:59.929> which<00:02:00.619> we

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
continue with us on the 737 which we

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.649 
continue with us on the 737 which we
will<00:02:00.920> continue<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.460> make<00:02:01.609> better<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.179> in<00:02:02.539> our

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
will continue to make better and in our

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.169 
will continue to make better and in our
view<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.049> neo<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.939> a320<00:02:04.939> with<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
view the neo the a320 with the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.090 
view the neo the a320 with the
re-engined<00:02:05.719> only<00:02:06.140> makes<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.560> airplane<00:02:06.950> as

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
re-engined only makes that airplane as

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.290 
re-engined only makes that airplane as
good<00:02:07.310> as<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.579> one<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.060> currently

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
good as the one that we're currently

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.940 
good as the one that we're currently
producing<00:02:09.110> that's<00:02:09.319> from<00:02:09.500> your<00:02:09.619> Airbus

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
producing that's from your Airbus

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.830 
producing that's from your Airbus
competitor<00:02:10.429> that's<00:02:10.759> correct<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.540> yeah<00:02:11.659> we

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
competitor that's correct so yeah we

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.190 
competitor that's correct so yeah we
think<00:02:12.050> our<00:02:12.200> our<00:02:12.230> customers<00:02:12.590> will<00:02:13.010> weigh

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
think our our customers will weigh

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.300 
think our our customers will weigh
for<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.440> airplane<00:02:13.680> they've<00:02:13.890> told<00:02:14.040> us<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
for that airplane they've told us the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.140 
for that airplane they've told us the
way<00:02:16.400> you're<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.519> company<00:02:17.879> that's<00:02:18.060> just

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
way you're not a company that's just

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.520 
way you're not a company that's just
doing<00:02:18.450> economic<00:02:18.780> forecasts<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.379> your

you've<00:02:25.410> seen<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.910> market<00:02:26.910> increase<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.870> number

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you've seen a market increase the number

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
you've seen a market increase the number
of<00:02:28.110> planes<00:02:28.319> sold<00:02:28.560> even<00:02:28.709> from<00:02:29.340> what<00:02:29.489> you

of planes sold even from what you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
thought a few months ago well there

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.020 
thought a few months ago well there
certainly<00:02:31.019> are<00:02:31.260> issues<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.980> impact<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
certainly are issues that impact the the

certainly are issues that impact the the
airline<00:02:33.330> industry<00:02:33.510> you've<00:02:33.930> got<00:02:34.140> SARS<00:02:34.500> you've

airline industry you've got SARS you've
got<00:02:34.860> volcanoes<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.610> get<00:02:35.900> terrorism's<00:02:36.900> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
got volcanoes you get terrorism's you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.680 
got volcanoes you get terrorism's you
know<00:02:37.500> issues<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.069> fuel<00:02:38.489> prices<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.599> if

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
know issues like that fuel prices but if

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
know issues like that fuel prices but if
we<00:02:39.810> look<00:02:40.019> back<00:02:40.170> historically<00:02:40.620> air<00:02:41.340> traffic

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
we look back historically air traffic

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.720 
we look back historically air traffic
grows<00:02:42.120> by<00:02:42.390> about<00:02:42.420> 1.5<00:02:43.260> times<00:02:43.620> world<00:02:43.980> GDP<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
grows by about 1.5 times world GDP and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
grows by about 1.5 times world GDP and
based<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.630> what<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:45.810> think<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> conservative

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
based on what we think is a conservative

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.589 
based on what we think is a conservative
estimate<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:48.120> there's<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.330> market

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
estimate and we think there's a market

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.440 
estimate and we think there's a market
for<00:02:48.810> over<00:02:49.370> 33,000<00:02:50.370> airplanes<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> next<00:02:51.209> 20

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
for over 33,000 airplanes of the next 20

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.210 
for over 33,000 airplanes of the next 20
years<00:02:51.660> which<00:02:52.380> adds<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.920> about<00:02:53.010> four

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
years which adds up to about four

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.910 
years which adds up to about four
trillion<00:02:53.549> dollars<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.840> far<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.530> oil<00:02:55.590> price

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
trillion dollars as far as the oil price

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.910 
trillion dollars as far as the oil price
goes<00:02:56.420> when<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> gets<00:02:57.660> higher<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.590> actually

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
goes when it gets higher it actually

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.050 
goes when it gets higher it actually
helps<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.250> some<00:02:59.400> ways<00:02:59.579> because<00:02:59.670> airlines

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and how does that affect your

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.440 
and how does that affect your
decision-making<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:09.000> think<00:03:09.269> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
decision-making well I don't think the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.300 
decision-making well I don't think the
the<00:03:09.870> trend<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.349> going<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.709> down<00:03:10.950> anytime

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the trend is going to be down anytime

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.979 
the trend is going to be down anytime
soon<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.299> think<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.840> continue

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
soon but I think it's going to continue

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.410 
soon but I think it's going to continue
to<00:03:13.380> be<00:03:13.620> upward<00:03:14.099> pressure<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.489> fuel<00:03:14.849> prices<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
to be upward pressure on fuel prices and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.629 
to be upward pressure on fuel prices and

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
that really is is one of the things that
