00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.970 
so what is the secret of this project
maybe<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.040> color<00:02:28.379> or<00:02:29.379> maybe<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.099> tires<00:02:31.980> but

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
maybe the color or maybe the tires but

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.229 
maybe the color or maybe the tires but
none<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.340> these<00:02:33.459> things<00:02:33.879> are<00:02:34.180> new<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:37.120> are

none of these things are new there are
lots<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.629> other<00:02:37.900> projects<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:39.220> similar

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
lots of other projects with similar
