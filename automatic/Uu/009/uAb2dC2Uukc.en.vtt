just come on set it down next thing

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.310 
just come on set it down next thing
you're<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.840> unscrew<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you're going to do is just unscrew the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.299 
you're going to do is just unscrew the
radio<00:00:37.940> four<00:00:38.940> screws<00:00:39.379> on<00:00:40.379> each<00:00:40.649> side<00:00:40.680> usually

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
radio four screws on each side usually

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.790 
radio four screws on each side usually
suck<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> something<00:00:47.460> anybody<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.030> do

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
suck it this is something anybody can do

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.340 
suck it this is something anybody can do
with<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> couple<00:00:50.219> hand<00:00:50.430> tools

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
with a couple hand tools

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.459 
with a couple hand tools
it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> truly<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.690> ten<00:00:54.690> minute<00:00:54.899> radio<00:00:55.590> swap<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
it is truly a ten minute radio swap and

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
it is truly a ten minute radio swap and
that's<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.850> radios<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.449> designed

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that's because these radios are designed

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
that's because these radios are designed
an<00:01:01.739> exact<00:01:02.190> match<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.600> factory<00:01:04.019> your

with an adapter for the radio antenna we

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.760 
with an adapter for the radio antenna we
just<00:01:52.409> simply<00:01:52.680> plug<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:55.350> gives<00:01:55.530> us<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
just simply plug in that gives us I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.789 
just simply plug in that gives us I

intended for the the wiring

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
intended for the the wiring
we've<00:02:01.799> done<00:02:02.040> except<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.549> harness

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
we've done except for harness

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.110 
we've done except for harness
it<00:02:04.650> looks<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:04.980> this<00:02:05.220> you'll<00:02:05.640> notice<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
it looks like this you'll notice the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.389 
it looks like this you'll notice the
harness<00:02:06.480> fits<00:02:07.410> directly<00:02:07.620> into<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.070> factory

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
harness fits directly into the factory

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.320 
harness fits directly into the factory
harness<00:02:09.619> plug<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.740> in<00:02:10.860> clamp<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
harness plug it in clamp it down and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.100 
harness plug it in clamp it down and
it's<00:02:12.630> solid<00:02:14.000> from<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.210> we've<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> couple

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's solid from this we've got a couple

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.600 
it's solid from this we've got a couple
wires<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.560> plug<00:02:16.740> into<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> radio<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.490> we're

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
wires to plug into the radio and we're

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.990 
wires to plug into the radio and we're
done<00:02:18.950> first<00:02:19.950> thing<00:02:20.130> we're<00:02:20.370> gonna<00:02:20.460> plug<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.850> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
done first thing we're gonna plug in is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.770 
done first thing we're gonna plug in is
the<00:02:21.510> main<00:02:21.720> power<00:02:24.860> you'll<00:02:25.860> hear<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.130> beep

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the main power you'll hear it beep

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.000 
the main power you'll hear it beep
second<00:02:27.780> thing<00:02:27.960> we're<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> plug<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.650> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
second thing we're going to plug in is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.040 
second thing we're going to plug in is
the<00:02:29.850> tower<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.450> third<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:35.160> lead

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the tower on and the third is this lead

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.100 
the tower on and the third is this lead
plugs<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.570> see<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:39.930> are

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
plugs right in and I see these are

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.780 
plugs right in and I see these are
matched<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> pulley<00:02:41.070> program<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:41.580> plug

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
matched so the pulley program will plug

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.170 
matched so the pulley program will plug
in<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.990> we<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> ability<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.180> plug

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
in and we also have the ability you plug

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 
in and we also have the ability you plug
