00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.910
 Now let's start testing 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.200
 handling of our sonic package 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.940
 starting we can inhibit that we have what 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 which is our package that is a 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.620
 automatic transmission 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.410
 of 6 speeds that can also be 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 what is the triptronic model with the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 which we can control the speed 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.109
 constant that the car has 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.109
 as in this way 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.570
 we also count the board that has 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.940
 a motorcycle type exhibition comes 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.620
 chromed in all versions and going to go 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.440

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.380
 speedometer control gasoline 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.960
 odometer and the markings that go 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.080
 from the oil the temperature the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 gasoline and even the initiator to have 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.800
 the seatbelt 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.930
 in the most equipped version also 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.440
 We drive controls at the steering wheel system 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.440
 bluetooth 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.579
 other speakers bluetooth theme and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.350
 also cd with mp3 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.689
 in the part of the turn was superior 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.250
 look what would be the usb and a mini 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.740
 compartment for what would be our 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.840
 ipod it should also be noted that the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.360
 more equipped version comes with 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 sunroof and motion sensors for 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 that at the moment that the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.330
 alarm any movement that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.100
 detect in the car you can give a 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.659
 signal to the driver 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.610
 now let's handle what is the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.049
 impact test to put what they are 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.049
 the brakes of our sonic model 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 as we can see we can make a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.860
 Acceleration up to 100 kilos kilometers 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.300
 per hour and stop it to zero without 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.900
 no problem and without the car 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.900
 lose control 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.820
 now from the version that would be our 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.250
 version we can handle 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.060
 electric glasses a system of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.979
 security with remote control 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.770
 and also what would be our 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.350
 rear view sighs with movement 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 electric 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.640
 It should be noted that all versions 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.640
 of sound drive your air conditioner 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.230
 in the most equipped versions like 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 he commented he also has controls to the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.600
 steering wheel to handle what is the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.800
 product 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 the stereo 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.690
 and the volume obviously of also the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690
 same 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.970
 part of the design that you want to manage 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.280
 here on the floor 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.220
 we end up managing what they are then 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.890
 in all the packages that go from a 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.049
 color two-tone brick with black make a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.000
 color that we are seeing right now is a 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.000
 color my gray tone with cream 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.370
 It should also be mentioned that our 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.030
 model are and that is driving an engine 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.799

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.280
