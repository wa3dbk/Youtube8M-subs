straight<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.329> would<00:03:38.480> probably<00:03:39.079> need<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.260> slight

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
straight it would probably need a slight

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.869 
straight it would probably need a slight
adjustment<00:03:39.709> if<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.400> were<00:03:40.459> going<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.670> keep

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
adjustment if we were going to keep

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.330 
adjustment if we were going to keep
these<00:03:41.060> light<00:03:41.329> strings<00:03:41.720> on<00:03:41.959> there's<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:43.010> slight

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
these light strings on there's a slight

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.089 
these light strings on there's a slight
buzz<00:03:43.640> on<00:03:44.299> fret<00:03:44.569> 1<00:03:44.780> &amp;<00:03:44.959> 2<00:03:45.079> on<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.440> low<00:03:45.620> E<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.010> a

strings<00:03:46.540> I'm<00:03:47.540> gonna<00:03:47.780> try<00:03:47.989> some<00:03:48.170> number<00:03:48.379> 10

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
strings I'm gonna try some number 10

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.319 
strings I'm gonna try some number 10
strings<00:03:48.890> like<00:03:49.099> I<00:03:49.250> said<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.730> we'll<00:03:49.939> see<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.269> that

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
strings like I said so we'll see if that

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.940 
strings like I said so we'll see if that
extra<00:03:50.750> tension<00:03:50.959> doesn't<00:03:51.319> pull<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.709> thing

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
extra tension doesn't pull this thing

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.559 
extra tension doesn't pull this thing
back<00:03:52.129> around<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:52.819> don't<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.239> do<00:03:53.359> any

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
back around so we don't have to do any

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.530 
back around so we don't have to do any

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
have not pulled these screws out to see

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.879 
have not pulled these screws out to see
how<00:04:17.180> long<00:04:17.389> they<00:04:17.449> are<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:18.620> doubt<00:04:18.859> that

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
how long they are and I doubt that

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.849 
how long they are and I doubt that
something<00:04:19.400> I'm<00:04:19.519> gonna<00:04:19.639> do<00:04:20.530> okay<00:04:21.530> looking<00:04:21.829> at

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
something I'm gonna do okay looking at

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.290 
something I'm gonna do okay looking at
the<00:04:21.979> fretboard<00:04:22.220> here<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:22.669> can<00:04:22.820> see<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.120> not

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
the fretboard here we can see it's not

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.839 
the fretboard here we can see it's not
too<00:04:23.360> glossy<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.260> oil<00:04:24.530> I've<00:04:25.340> played<00:04:25.729> this

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
too glossy with oil I've played this

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.730 
too glossy with oil I've played this
guitar<00:04:26.030> for<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.449> few<00:04:26.690> weeks<00:04:26.840> now<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:27.500> there's

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
guitar for a few weeks now so there's

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.409 
guitar for a few weeks now so there's
probably<00:04:28.099> some<00:04:28.370> oil<00:04:28.610> from<00:04:28.760> my<00:04:28.910> fingers<00:04:29.270> in

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
probably some oil from my fingers in

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.439 
probably some oil from my fingers in
there<00:04:30.310> another<00:04:31.310> guitar<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.880> ordered<00:04:32.120> was

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
there another guitar that I ordered was

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.570 
there another guitar that I ordered was
really<00:04:32.960> dry<00:04:33.169> looking<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:34.310> could<00:04:34.460> definitely

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
really dry looking you could definitely

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.360 
really dry looking you could definitely
tell<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.030> never<00:04:35.210> had<00:04:35.360> oil<00:04:35.599> so<00:04:36.160> judging<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.250> two

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
tell it never had oil so judging the two

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.529 
tell it never had oil so judging the two
together<00:04:37.520> I'm<00:04:37.910> gonna<00:04:38.120> say<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.419> this

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
together I'm gonna say that this

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.629 
together I'm gonna say that this
probably<00:04:39.020> had<00:04:39.139> oil<00:04:39.380> on<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:39.770> at<00:04:39.919> some<00:04:40.250> point<00:04:40.490> at

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
probably had oil on it at some point at

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.089 
probably had oil on it at some point at
the<00:04:40.729> factory<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:42.500> can<00:04:42.650> see<00:04:42.800> here<00:04:42.949> we've<00:04:43.070> got

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
the factory you can see here we've got

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.210 
the factory you can see here we've got
these<00:04:43.810> indicators<00:04:44.810> for<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:44.990> frets<00:04:45.289> I<00:04:45.620> have<00:04:46.010> no

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
these indicators for the frets I have no

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.370 
these indicators for the frets I have no
idea<00:04:46.520> whether<00:04:46.729> this<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.150> abalone<00:04:47.599> or<00:04:47.630> pearl<00:04:48.080> or

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
idea whether this is abalone or pearl or

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.010 
idea whether this is abalone or pearl or
just<00:04:48.740> some<00:04:48.949> pearloid<00:04:49.510> it's<00:04:50.510> definitely<00:04:50.870> not<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
just some pearloid it's definitely not a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.200 
just some pearloid it's definitely not a
cream<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:52.490> then<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.729> course<00:04:52.880> we've<00:04:53.000> got<00:04:53.030> the

cream and then of course we've got the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.909 
cream and then of course we've got the
markers<00:04:53.510> up<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.870> face<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.380> neck<00:04:54.560> here

I<00:04:55.360> was<00:04:56.360> hoping<00:04:56.630> for<00:04:56.690> jumbo<00:04:57.080> frets<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.340> do

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
I was hoping for jumbo frets and I do

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.710 
I was hoping for jumbo frets and I do
not<00:04:58.669> believe<00:04:58.970> these<00:04:59.120> are<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.330> think<00:04:59.419> they're

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
not believe these are I think they're

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.110 
not believe these are I think they're
standards<00:05:00.229> but<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.280> cannot<00:05:01.610> complain<00:05:01.970> about

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
standards but I cannot complain about

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.659

the<00:05:02.330> quality<00:05:02.479> at<00:05:02.840> all<00:05:03.010> we<00:05:04.010> can<00:05:04.159> see<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.490> all

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
the quality at all we can see that all

adjustment every fret on every string
works<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:15.500> expected<00:05:16.720> not<00:05:17.720> being<00:05:18.050> very

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229

experienced<00:05:18.979> with<00:05:19.130> guitars<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.849> would<00:05:20.510> say

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
experienced with guitars I would say

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.290 
experienced with guitars I would say
that<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> shape<00:05:21.199> of<00:05:21.229> this<00:05:21.500> neck<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.710> thin

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
that the shape of this neck is thin

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.719 
that the shape of this neck is thin
comparable<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.419> an<00:05:23.510> Ibanez<00:05:23.990> neck<00:05:24.729> definitely

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
comparable to an Ibanez neck definitely

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.940 
comparable to an Ibanez neck definitely
thinner<00:05:26.030> than<00:05:26.240> an<00:05:26.360> Epiphone<00:05:26.780> SG<00:05:27.200> 400<00:05:27.800> and

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
thinner than an Epiphone SG 400 and

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.510 
thinner than an Epiphone SG 400 and
thinner<00:05:28.490> than<00:05:28.669> most<00:05:28.880> acoustics<00:05:29.419> I've<00:05:29.630> played

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
thinner than most acoustics I've played

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.230 
thinner than most acoustics I've played
okay<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.669> strings<00:05:31.969> are
