00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
aware of is the amount of heat that they

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.240 
aware of is the amount of heat that they
put<00:04:32.780> out<00:04:32.930> when<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.290> have<00:04:33.470> an<00:04:33.590> enclosed<00:04:33.950> system

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
put out when you have an enclosed system

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.270 
put out when you have an enclosed system
like<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.790> it's<00:04:35.450> very<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.470> very<00:04:36.770> bad<00:04:37.010> for

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
like this it's very it's very bad for

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.250 
like this it's very it's very bad for
the<00:04:37.370> heat<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.700> be<00:04:37.730> generated<00:04:38.140> underneath<00:04:39.140> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the heat to be generated underneath the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.860 
the heat to be generated underneath the
cabinetry<00:04:39.770> without<00:04:40.190> being<00:04:40.460> vented<00:04:40.880> out<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.750> we

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
cabinetry without being vented out so we

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.720 
cabinetry without being vented out so we
took<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.110> couple<00:04:42.410> special<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.040> couple<00:04:43.610> of

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
took a couple special of a couple of

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.400 
took a couple special of a couple of
special<00:04:44.390> measures<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.930> order<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.200> make<00:04:45.380> sure

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
special measures in order to make sure

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.890 
special measures in order to make sure
that<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.830> chiller<00:04:46.100> was<00:04:46.310> well<00:04:46.550> ventilated

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
that this chiller was well ventilated

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.390 
that this chiller was well ventilated
right<00:04:47.900> here<00:04:48.110> on<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.410> door<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.980> can<00:04:49.130> see<00:04:49.160> this

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
right here on this door you can see this

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.350 
right here on this door you can see this
door<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:49.760> louver

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
door is louver

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.180 
door is louver
so<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.750> airflow<00:04:51.169> can<00:04:51.410> go<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.860> out<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.100> it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
so that airflow can go in and out of it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.100 
so that airflow can go in and out of it
on<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.210> inside<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.570> this<00:04:53.660> door<00:04:53.720> we<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.080> a

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
on the inside of this door we have a

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.500 
on the inside of this door we have a

just a regular computer fan that when it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.200 
just a regular computer fan that when it
is<00:04:59.690> on<00:04:59.870> it's<00:05:00.050> virtually<00:05:00.500> silent<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:02.060> when

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
is on it's virtually silent so when

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.909 
is on it's virtually silent so when
that's<00:05:02.390> closed<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.050> chillers<00:05:03.350> on<00:05:03.560> it
