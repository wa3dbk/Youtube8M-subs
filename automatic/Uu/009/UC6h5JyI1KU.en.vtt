00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.440
 me to my pocket knife series 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:37.309
 I actually only welcome 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:43.660
 the big knife and fixed knife 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.589
 and as I said now I want to join 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.420
 Small is a few small knives 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:54.730
 as I said, he also needs 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 a few that was thankfully part 3 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.460
 So here we have a pocketknife 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 I already have that from wenger 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.449
 has a whole head on it longer 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.180
 I believe everything else up here 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.240
 once bottle opener 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.909
 behind it we have an all what with 1 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.650
 Of course you can miss it here 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.479
 can opener good bottle you can get too 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.000
 so on but they have extra-again 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.450
 then we have a blade here and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.830
 savvy advantage that things are certain 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.439
 that means I have to go here I have to 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.890
 press on this cross then it is on 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.890
 fold 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.070
 and if I here what now he has 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.780
 above a finger pad that one 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.160
 does not slip off the medium milled 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.850
 very pleasant the blade then I have 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.410

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.080
 ausparken this up front I do not know 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.290
 if you look dull then here very much 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.930
 sharp then enter then practically 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.950
 the abdomen on or with the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.320
 lace for example the guts 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.040
 can destroy 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.840
 then we have a bone saw here 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.990
 or wood seeger so bones for 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.470
 Bone is very good for that 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.010
 So closed virtually shut the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.020

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.350
 can remove after 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.030

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.140
 slotted screwdriver 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.430
