verse it'll keep doing that pattern
until<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.280> chorus<00:02:51.730> at<00:02:51.970> 40<00:02:52.840> seconds<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.740> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
until the chorus at 40 seconds in and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.770 
until the chorus at 40 seconds in and
when<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.700> gets<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.060> chorus<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> actually

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
when it gets to the chorus it actually

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
when it gets to the chorus it actually
switches<00:02:55.900> back<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.770> more<00:02:57.130> difficult

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
switches back to that more difficult

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.550 
switches back to that more difficult
pattern<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.240> we<00:02:58.330> learned<00:02:58.570> from<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.290> very

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
pattern that we learned from the very

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.190 
pattern that we learned from the very
intro<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.820> song<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.660> strumming<00:03:02.050> goes

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
intro of the song the strumming goes

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.840 
intro of the song the strumming goes
something<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.620> this

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.940 

but<00:03:06.850> really<00:03:07.600> fast<00:03:10.080> okay<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.500> what<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.800> is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
but really fast okay and what that is

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.210 
but really fast okay and what that is
broken<00:03:12.190> down<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:13.030> bass<00:03:13.570> stroke<00:03:14.260> where<00:03:15.100> we

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
broken down is a bass stroke where we

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.130 
broken down is a bass stroke where we
hit<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.700> bottom<00:03:15.910> string<00:03:16.420> or<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> bottom

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
hit the bottom string or the bottom

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.810 
hit the bottom string or the bottom
strings<00:03:17.500> you'll<00:03:17.800> notice<00:03:18.070> here<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:18.370> also<00:03:18.550> in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
strings you'll notice here I'm also in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.580 
strings you'll notice here I'm also in
an<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.120> minor<00:03:19.450> chord<00:03:19.600> that's<00:03:20.110> just<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> first

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
an a minor chord that's just the first

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.930 
an a minor chord that's just the first
chord<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.190> I'll<00:03:21.250> start<00:03:21.520> there<00:03:22.110> bass<00:03:23.550> strum<00:03:24.550> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
chord so I'll start there bass strum and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.860 
chord so I'll start there bass strum and
then<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> real<00:03:26.080> fast<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:27.100> down<00:03:27.850> up

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.490 

that's<00:03:31.440> slow<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.459> little<00:03:32.700> bit<00:03:32.790> faster

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that's slow this is a little bit faster

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.290 
that's slow this is a little bit faster
and<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.340> up<00:03:35.490> speed<00:03:37.040> okay<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.760> practice

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
and this is up speed okay so practice

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.480 
and this is up speed okay so practice
that<00:03:39.510> slowly<00:03:40.020> work<00:03:40.620> your<00:03:40.650> way<00:03:40.980> up<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
that slowly work your way up with the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.730 
that slowly work your way up with the
strumming<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.450> melody<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.080> really<00:03:43.530> nice

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
strumming and that melody is really nice

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.680 
strumming and that melody is really nice
so<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.070> thought<00:03:44.340> we'd<00:03:44.520> go<00:03:44.670> ahead<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.120> spend<00:03:45.600> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
so I thought we'd go ahead and spend a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:56.930 
so I thought we'd go ahead and spend a
little<00:03:45.840> time<00:03:46.500> learning<00:03:46.710> that<00:03:46.980> melody<00:03:55.940> okay

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
little time learning that melody okay

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.690 
little time learning that melody okay
that's<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.630> melody<00:03:57.840> basically<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.400> speed

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
that's the melody basically up to speed

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.130 
that's the melody basically up to speed
now<00:03:59.910> I'm<00:04:00.270> gonna<00:04:00.390> slow<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.630> down<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.050> we're

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
now I'm gonna slow it down and we're

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.510 
now I'm gonna slow it down and we're
gonna<00:04:01.290> learn<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.920> little<00:04:02.040> bit<00:04:02.190> by<00:04:02.490> a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
gonna learn it just a little bit by a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.510 
gonna learn it just a little bit by a
little<00:04:02.820> bit<00:04:02.970> okay<00:04:03.450> starts<00:04:04.050> here<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.460> to

occasion I number the strings from the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.740 
occasion I number the strings from the
bottom<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.490> so<00:04:11.730> does<00:04:11.880> everybody<00:04:12.150> else<00:04:12.540> that's

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
