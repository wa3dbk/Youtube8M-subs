here we're just going to use a small
grouting<00:03:45.640> bag<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.790> works<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.270> same

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
grouting bag and this works on the same

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.880 
grouting bag and this works on the same
process<00:03:50.020> as<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:51.150> pastry<00:03:52.150> bag<00:03:52.390> for<00:03:52.890> decorating
