00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.030
 in this chapter we will begin a 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.100
 work with the html5 to put in 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.650
 practice what has been said so far in 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.490
 elections in previous chapters 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.220
 we will then start by creating a new one 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.889
 html 5 document from scratch and we will exploit 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.320
 dreamweaver cc creative cloud come 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.270
 editing software in the stands are there 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.910
 two ways to create a new document 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.449
 in html5 the first is obviously that of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.220
 select create new html from 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 introductory home screen of 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.050
 dreamweaver or to be sure that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.829
 actually new document is in 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.690
 html5 go to the menu item file 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.379
 select new or against the n key 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.979
 shortcut choose from the sections of 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.809
 a blank page document in html e 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.839
 without any layout of course because 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.949
 we must create our page from scratch 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.929
 verify that the document type is 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.030
 precisely in html5 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.670
 done that we can confirm by clicking 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.979
 su create and here is what we have 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.239
 created the first new page in html5 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.130
 as always the good practice a 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.070
 regardless of the software e 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.020
 from the work that is taking place it is always 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.579
 to save the new document 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.609
 just created even if empty then 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.130
 from the menu item save or against 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.200
 it is a quick choice rate and where 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.770
 we prefer in our case we choose the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.840
 desktop 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.929
 let's go save our page 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.460
 it will be called for example test 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.320
 precisely html 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.329
 obviously the extension of the pages in 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.020
 html5 as well as versions 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.340
 previous is always and remains html 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.390
 obviously as you can see a page 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.009
 in html5 it is completely similar to a page 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.420
 built with versions prior to 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.399
 example of html 4.01 or xhtml there are 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.799
 obviously only two variants that 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.539
 concern the type of reduced document 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.240
 now to the simple doctype string 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.039
 html and the charset that is the set of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.020
 characters you use utf8 that is 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.270
 this was also shortened to this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.549
 simple coats of arms apart from these two 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 differences for which we refer to 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.690
 second chapter of this video course 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.030
 first lesson when we talked about 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.720
 syntax of the html differences with the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.810
 old versions 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.680
 here aside these distinctions do not exist 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 are big variations between html 5 4 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 there are obviously many implementations 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.019
 as we have also had way of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.840
 deepen in the previous elections 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.629
 where we had the chance today 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.549
 to insert audio video with much more 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.110
 ease and without using plug in di 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.610
 third parties we can design 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.370
 even within the pages 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 we also have other new modules for 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.670
 data entry by 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.180
 user as we will see later in 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.819
 next chapter and thanks css3 we can 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.430
 give a graphic look to ours 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.049
 html5 products certainly much more 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.790
 fascinating much more pleasing than 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.530
 how much could not be done before 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.620
 with a whole series of work arounds 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.969
 therefore of solutions a little difficult than that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.620
 they involved hours of work instead 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.280
 much more can be done 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.409
 quickly 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.489
 there are also obviously many others 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.260
 news that also concern the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.920
 geolocation data saving 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.019
 in local 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.209
 all of the topics we've covered 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.640
 in previous elections but from one point 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.890
 of sight just syntactic writing 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.840
 everything remains exactly as before 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.700
 we continue to work by tag ie 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.439
 therefore for instructions included between the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.829
 symbol of major minor with theirs 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.060
 related if you have closing tags e 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.590
 all that has to be 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.879
 displayed ie all that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.799
 we want the user to see inside 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.900
 of our page must continue to 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.419
 be present within the body tag 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.120
 slash body then inside the body 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.919
 of our end page substantially 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.689
 so fortunately for us 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.209
 writing the new version of html 5 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.310
 is the exact same before changes the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.169
 way of working obviously comes into 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.939
 game is also very important here 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.639
 argument syntax that we always have 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.620
 detailed in the previous chapter in 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.239
 which this time you need to operate 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.340
 very specific choices and precisely because 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.109
 tags are increased 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.519
 we therefore have more options and 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.349
 we have to choose with more 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.790
 precision cutting element that 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.479
 we want to insert inside the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.729
 our page 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.859
 always keeping obviously well done in 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.650
 mind what we want to do 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.409
 obviously that is always the focal point 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.769
 of a good production of a site of 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.769
 web pages
