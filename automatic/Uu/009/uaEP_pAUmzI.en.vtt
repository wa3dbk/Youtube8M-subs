to work with the resonate boys just

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.430 
to work with the resonate boys just

u21 and three-quarters two and
three-quarters<00:03:11.080> when<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.110> made<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.650> board<00:03:12.950> I

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
three-quarters when I made this board I

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.640 
three-quarters when I made this board I
was<00:03:13.569> thinking<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.720> making<00:03:15.110> something<00:03:15.440> that

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
was thinking of making something that

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.350 
was thinking of making something that
was<00:03:15.890> farm<00:03:16.250> easy<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.790> serve<00:03:18.670> easy<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.880> paddle

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
was farm easy to serve easy to paddle

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.440 
was farm easy to serve easy to paddle
get<00:03:20.780> out<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.050> ways<00:03:21.290> real<00:03:21.830> quick<00:03:22.120> still<00:03:23.120> be

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
get out to the ways real quick still be

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.250 
get out to the ways real quick still be

tight<00:03:27.530> situations<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> had<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.690> set<00:03:29.930> up

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
tight situations so I had it set up

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.509 
tight situations so I had it set up
where<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:31.810> forfeit<00:03:32.810> set<00:03:33.140> up<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:34.370> had

more<00:04:36.100> live<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.610> squirm<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
more live and squirm and just the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.940 
more live and squirm and just the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
the placement of the fins this makes a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.420 
the placement of the fins this makes a
fun<00:04:46.930> board

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.730 

what<00:04:51.390> kind<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.720> ways<00:04:52.260> would<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.560> ride<00:04:52.710> that
