00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.530
 Hi, my name is Alfredo Moreno, I'm 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.130
 forward well well the truth has been 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.140
 formed a large group all the 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 Boys are focused on 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 in the tournament knowing that it's going to be very 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.660
 hard what 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.820
 we have everything is a clear objective that 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.660
 that's important these guys that 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.180
 they got joined that dream to that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.850
 objective and good we are the truth all 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.520
 in a great environment to start the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.190
 tournament that will undoubtedly be very hard and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.410
 since the first game 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 is going to be noticed because it's going to be a tournament 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.300
 where many teams are also 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.340
 fighting the descent 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.450
 not the truth that very happy is not 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 easy and it has not been easy to power 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.879
 keep me in power for it is very 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.559
 easy to reach but stay the difficult 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.930
 it's the difficult thing because you have to have 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.530
 a regularity you have to be always 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.770
 fulfilling the institution where are you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 I am happy here because apart from the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.470
 things that we gain without a doubt that the city 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.440
 the people alone 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.710
 there is not a cute darling there is not a 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 important connection then take advantage 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.120
 in that and not settle in or not be 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.060
 mediocre and stay in comfort 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.410
 taking it to ie9 but on the contrary 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.270
 to demand to demand more what always 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.690
 I say one by learning it throughout the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.690
 career but today I do one of the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.479
 different things and learn from the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.920
 past mistakes then today I think the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.960
 work 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
 the commitment of 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.430
 to know that you have to do much more 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 what you did makes it continue to last 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.799
 in the race 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.170
 it's going to be difficult, puebla is a team that 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.720
 is fighting the descent and they're 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.970
 entrance they will go out to want to kill no 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.970
 we know that this is how it is played 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.670
 they have three points for them 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.319
 insurance are thinking that but we 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.130
 we have to be smart to know what 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.680
 it's going to happen read the game before reading everything 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.960
 what is happening around the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 match and take advantage of all 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.430
 we know that they can on their court 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.780
 then also be able to take advantage of 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.120
 that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.030
 and get out there a plus not what it is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.970
 the match to what will be of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.740
 intensity and good there has to go out 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.820
 the football theme of each one for 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.820
 in order to achieve the objective
