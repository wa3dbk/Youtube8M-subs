00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.329
 Translation www.pestograpta.gr 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.709
 Forgive me with a father. 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.899
 I sinned. 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.849
 - When did you last confess? - 60 years ago. 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.039
 Almost. 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.929
 - Confess to every sin that has driven you away from Christ. - No no. 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.119
 We will sit here forever. 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.230
 Let's just talk about today. 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.070
 - I missed you. - You too. 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.259
 - That weird? - Yeah. 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.449
 This is my best friend. 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.580
 She just came back from a long journey. 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.770
 Let's welcome the welcome. 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.790
 Kill him until 10 am. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 Otherwise, you will also die. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.570
 - Well, who will do it? - What to do; 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.530
 - You know what. - Just say it, you. - Me. 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.480
 What do you want to do by then? 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.370
 So far, I've stolen a nice car .. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 A few drugs .. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.440
 Fine. 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.019
 - No drugs in the bar. - It's prescribed, I have hypertension. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.379
 But I did some good too. 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.940
 I saved my friend. 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.869
 - Give me the key. - He has no key. 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.260
 - It does not have a button. Tap it. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 Like we are in the future. 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 Can I say a prayer and end here? 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.300
 - I do not think a prayer will save you. - You are right. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 - It is over; - I am working on it. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.900
 They say we die 2 times. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 Translation www.pestograpta.gr 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.130
 The first 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.930
 when the breath leaves the body. 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.659
 And one when the last person we know says our name. 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.740
 You are my new hero. 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.490
 I was away for a long time. 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.720
 I just want to dance with you. 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 - You are my only friend. - And you mine. 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.049
 - Like old, right? - No, it's better. 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.289
 I can not do it. 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.229
 Mercy. 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.319
 It's over. 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.730
 I got the responsibility .. 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.739
 ...for all. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.319
 I'm a good guy.
