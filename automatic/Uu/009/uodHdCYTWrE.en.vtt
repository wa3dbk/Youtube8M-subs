00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.040
 explain a little all the art ferrari 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.889
 who are present in king march for in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.719
 mix then the first thing I do 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.639
 see one of the others and that there are 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 also therefore towards a normal case 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.100
 white shelters as you see now we are 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.230
 from tarzan 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 but these films appear in all of them 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 the worlds and according to the worlds do 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 require we say different spells 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.510
 do you see how it works in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.349
 practice you have to lock one is in the base 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.570
 to the movement that makes one must follow one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.030
 magic for example meets about hot 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.739
 hot blizzard 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.460
 now with this light of me care tyner 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 there are on the internet all the le 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.039
 magic you see when you do 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.860
 three spells in a row there are still three magi 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
 and he will give you a bang of magic like 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 you have seen is an object that can also 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 be drop remember if you want wrong 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 example now in fast under when he 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.750
 he wants to breezer he gets angry if he leaves and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.270
 so it works like this when it is 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.619
 lying down on the ground wants energy 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.770
 when he does so it means he wants 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.290
 blizzard when it was the bbc from the cold 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.270
 He wants to fire when he votes on himself 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 himself wants aero when it is worth in the air 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.490
 magic 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.229
 then fire shivers blizzard to 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 hot thunder to buy a light in 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.409
 head energy collapses to the ground in 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.380
 this the way it is doing now 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.689
 antimo havona stock gas comes off him yes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.429
 remains locked you want five stop aero 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.750
 turns on itself all changed then 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.119
 serves to find practically drops 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.770
 remember it is if you do the same three times 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.110
 magic so because I do n't know three times 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.869

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.959
 time you have all the masters in all 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.060
 the magic you can go to as a merlin magician 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.130
 which gives you if I am not mistaken a shield for 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.409
 which can be a Donald Duck snout anyway 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.929
 a weapon that serves to make the trophy of 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.220
