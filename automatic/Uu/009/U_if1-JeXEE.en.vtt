frame that you have first thing we have
right<00:00:23.829> here<00:00:23.860> is<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.309> hot<00:00:24.489> plate<00:00:24.730> hot<00:00:25.000> plates

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
right here is the hot plate hot plates

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.999 
right here is the hot plate hot plates
if<00:00:25.419> you're<00:00:25.570> not<00:00:25.689> familiar<00:00:25.809> with<00:00:26.050> 3d<00:00:26.410> printers

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
if you're not familiar with 3d printers

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.799 
if you're not familiar with 3d printers
as<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.399> starts<00:00:27.669> extruding<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.270> plastic<00:00:28.660> on

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:28.809 
as it starts extruding the plastic on

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:31.049 
as it starts extruding the plastic on
top<00:00:29.020> if<00:00:29.860> it<00:00:29.950> doesn't<00:00:30.250> have<00:00:30.340> a<00:00:30.369> hot<00:00:30.610> plate<00:00:30.790> it

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
top if it doesn't have a hot plate it

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.030 
top if it doesn't have a hot plate it
can<00:00:31.180> cause<00:00:31.450> curling<00:00:32.020> that's<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.439> plastic<00:00:32.829> cools

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
can cause curling that's a plastic cools

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.400 
can cause curling that's a plastic cools
that<00:00:33.219> flexes<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.880> distorts<00:00:34.360> this<00:00:34.930> stops<00:00:35.200> that

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
that flexes and distorts this stops that

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.080 
that flexes and distorts this stops that
from<00:00:35.440> happening<00:00:35.740> it<00:00:36.070> also<00:00:36.190> helps<00:00:36.580> it<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.850> here

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
from happening it also helps it and here

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.700 
from happening it also helps it and here
to<00:00:37.330> this<00:00:37.510> as<00:00:37.690> well<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.870> lot<00:00:38.020> of<00:00:38.140> people<00:00:38.350> just<00:00:38.380> use

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
to this as well a lot of people just use

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.050 
to this as well a lot of people just use
a<00:00:38.740> little<00:00:38.890> hat<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.220> little<00:00:39.400> hairspray<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:39.880> top

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
a little hat a little hairspray on top

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.150 
a little hat a little hairspray on top
of<00:00:40.180> this<00:00:40.270> when<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.570> start<00:00:40.780> 3d<00:00:41.080> printing<00:00:41.500> helps

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
of this when you start 3d printing helps

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.440 
of this when you start 3d printing helps
bond<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.520> right<00:00:42.670> on<00:00:42.790> down<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.120> we<00:00:43.210> have<00:00:43.330> the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
bond it right on down but we have the

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.030 
bond it right on down but we have the
hot<00:00:43.600> plate<00:00:43.870> with<00:00:44.080> this<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.500> with<00:00:44.710> that<00:00:44.890> we

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
hot plate with this and with that we

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.620 
hot plate with this and with that we
actually<00:00:45.160> have<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.490> heater<00:00:45.820> control<00:00:46.240> module

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
actually have the heater control module

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.300 
actually have the heater control module
that<00:00:47.020> goes<00:00:47.200> along<00:00:47.350> with<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.920> hot<00:00:48.070> plate

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
that goes along with the hot plate

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.470 
that goes along with the hot plate
itself<00:00:48.670> we've<00:00:49.450> got<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.630> couple<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:50.550> LCD<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.820> 3d

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
itself we've got a couple of LCD and 3d

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.110 
itself we've got a couple of LCD and 3d

cards<00:00:55.450> in<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:55.840> you'll<00:00:55.960> be<00:00:56.050> able<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.260> do<00:00:56.410> your<00:00:56.980> 3d

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
cards in so you'll be able to do your 3d

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.790 
cards in so you'll be able to do your 3d
drawings<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:58.329> export<00:00:59.320> your<00:00:59.410> g-code

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
drawings and just export your g-code

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.500 
drawings and just export your g-code
straight<00:01:00.070> into<00:01:00.340> these<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.850> go<00:01:01.210> ahead<00:01:01.360> and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
straight into these and go ahead and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.120 
straight into these and go ahead and
give<00:01:01.600> them<00:01:01.720> run<00:01:01.989> two<00:01:02.290> variants<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.739> like

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
give them run two variants of that like

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.009 
give them run two variants of that like
I<00:01:03.160> said<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.550> based<00:01:03.730> on<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> rep<00:01:04.119> rat<00:01:04.360> type<00:01:04.899> of

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
I said is based on the rep rat type of

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.250 
I said is based on the rep rat type of
hardware<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:06.970> course<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.479> the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
hardware and we of course have the the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.440 
hardware and we of course have the the
stepper<00:01:08.470> drivers<00:01:08.950> as<00:01:09.190> well<00:01:09.250> as<00:01:09.909> your<00:01:10.120> extruder

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
stepper drivers as well as your extruder

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.960 
stepper drivers as well as your extruder
driver<00:01:10.840> all<00:01:11.380> available<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.280> basically<00:01:12.880> with

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
driver all available so basically with
