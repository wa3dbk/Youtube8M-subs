00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
package files but I'm going to just do a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.830 
package files but I'm going to just do a
normal<00:01:16.430> scan<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.149> show<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:17.720> it

so<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:18.709> scanning<00:01:19.039> all<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.340> my<00:01:19.640> cc<00:01:20.149> and<00:01:20.420> as<00:01:20.929> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
so it's scanning all of my cc and as you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.080 
so it's scanning all of my cc and as you
can<00:01:21.259> see<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.770> let<00:01:21.979> me<00:01:22.130> open<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.640> up<00:01:22.819> so<00:01:23.060> you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
can see this a little bit better and so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.219 
can see this a little bit better and so
this<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.640> all<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.940> cc<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.050> will

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
this is all the cc I have it will

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.410 
this is all the cc I have it will

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
as you can see here I know for a fact

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.730

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
this case that's what I want to do so

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.680 
this case that's what I want to do so
I'm<00:02:04.039> going<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.310> go<00:02:04.459> over<00:02:04.489> here<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.539> says

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
I'm going to go over here and it says

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990 
I'm going to go over here and it says
move<00:02:05.959> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.319> recycle<00:02:06.950> bin<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.700> going<00:02:07.910> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
move to the recycle bin so it's going to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.440 
move to the recycle bin so it's going to
remove<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.929> from<00:02:09.080> my<00:02:09.259> game<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.970> now<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.209> can

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
remove it from my game so now you can

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680 
remove it from my game so now you can
either<00:02:11.599> skip<00:02:12.160> restart<00:02:13.160> or<00:02:13.370> exit<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.239> I'm<00:02:14.420> going

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
either skip restart or exit so I'm going

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.380 
either skip restart or exit so I'm going
to<00:02:14.840> click<00:02:15.050> restart<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.069> now<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.360> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to click restart and now it's going to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.000 
to click restart and now it's going to
restart<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.959> program<00:02:17.989> again<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.860> can

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
restart the program again so you can

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.920 
restart the program again so you can
scan<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> again<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.629> do<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
scan it again and then you can do that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.500 
scan it again and then you can do that
over<00:02:21.140> with<00:02:21.560> each<00:02:21.860> file<00:02:22.240> what<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> would

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
over with each file what I would

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.920 
over with each file what I would
recommend<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.770> check<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.790> mod<00:02:26.060> type<00:02:26.600> is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
recommend is to check if the mod type is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.510 
recommend is to check if the mod type is
for<00:02:27.440> The<00:02:27.590> Sims<00:02:27.770> 4<00:02:27.920> because

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
for The Sims 4 because

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520 
for The Sims 4 because
is<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.640> couple<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.090> times<00:02:29.390> my<00:02:29.960> game<00:02:30.200> wouldn't

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
is a couple of times my game wouldn't

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.890 
is a couple of times my game wouldn't
start<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.610> files<00:02:32.000> they<00:02:32.360> were<00:02:32.570> dot

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
start because the files they were dot

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.230 
start because the files they were dot
package<00:02:33.470> files<00:02:33.800> which<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> sims<00:02:34.910> 4

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
package files which is what the sims 4

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.440 
package files which is what the sims 4
uses<00:02:35.840> for<00:02:36.110> CC<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.460> they<00:02:37.700> were<00:02:37.760> made<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
uses for CC but they were made for the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.560 
uses for CC but they were made for the
sims<00:02:38.690> 3<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.920> definitely<00:02:40.430> make<00:02:40.790> sure<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
sims 3 so definitely make sure that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.960 
sims 3 so definitely make sure that
these<00:02:41.870> say<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.530> sims<00:02:42.770> 4<00:02:43.070> if<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.370> says<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.700> sims

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
these say the sims 4 if it says the sims

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.610 
these say the sims 4 if it says the sims
3<00:02:44.060> that's<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.990> problem

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
3 that's your problem

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.920 
3 that's your problem
another<00:02:45.920> example<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.670> found<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.300> checking

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
another example that I found is checking

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.010 
another example that I found is checking
the<00:02:48.320> file<00:02:48.620> sizes<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.760> file<00:02:50.000> size<00:02:50.330> says<00:02:50.660> 0

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
the file sizes if the file size says 0

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.980 
the file sizes if the file size says 0
that<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.040> also<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.520> problem<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.540> will

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
that is also a problem and that will

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.620 
that is also a problem and that will
cause<00:02:54.230> your<00:02:54.440> game<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.640> open<00:02:56.150> so

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
cause your game to not open so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.870 
cause your game to not open so
definitely<00:02:57.140> keep<00:02:57.380> those<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.650> mind<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.340> again

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
definitely keep those in mind and again

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.750 
definitely keep those in mind and again
make<00:02:59.150> sure<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.750> delete<00:03:00.170> any<00:03:00.760> duplicates

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
make sure that you delete any duplicates

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.820 
make sure that you delete any duplicates
that<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.120> may<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.540> because<00:03:03.110> those<00:03:03.320> may<00:03:03.590> also

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
that you may have because those may also

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.980 
that you may have because those may also
conflict<00:03:04.550> with<00:03:04.790> your<00:03:04.970> game<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.480> another

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
conflict with your game and another

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.500 
conflict with your game and another
program<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.770> highly<00:03:07.250> recommend<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.970> the

see<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.840> have<00:03:21.200> way<00:03:21.560> too<00:03:21.620> much<00:03:22.040> CC<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:22.940> takes

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
see I have way too much CC so it takes

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.910 
see I have way too much CC so it takes
quite<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.450> while<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.780> start<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.620> did<00:03:24.800> that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
quite a while to start up so I did that

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.860 
quite a while to start up so I did that
beforehand<00:03:25.460> but<00:03:25.940> what<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.210> can<00:03:26.390> do<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.570> this

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
beforehand but what you can do on this

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.830 
beforehand but what you can do on this
one<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.320> can<00:03:27.770> check<00:03:28.370> enable<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.390> disable

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
one is you can check enable and disable

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.350 
one is you can check enable and disable
so<00:03:30.770> for<00:03:31.010> example<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.610> have<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> lot<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.180> eye

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
so for example if you have a lot of eye

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.750 
so for example if you have a lot of eye
colors<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.200> sims<00:03:33.440> 4<00:03:33.680> will<00:03:33.950> limit<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.730> amount

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
colors the sims 4 will limit the amount

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.610 
colors the sims 4 will limit the amount
of<00:03:35.090> eye<00:03:35.270> colors<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.990> can<00:03:36.140> actually<00:03:36.260> have

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
of eye colors that you can actually have

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.290 
of eye colors that you can actually have
in<00:03:36.709> your<00:03:36.770> game<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.430> will<00:03:37.520> replace<00:03:37.760> some

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
in your game and it will replace some

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.390 
in your game and it will replace some
with<00:03:38.540> others<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.440> if<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.680> only<00:03:39.920> want<00:03:40.310> a

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
with others so if you only want a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.610 
with others so if you only want a
certain<00:03:40.610> one<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.270> can<00:03:41.510> disable<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.590> eye

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
certain one you can disable the eye

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.980 
certain one you can disable the eye
colors<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.340> enable<00:03:43.760> other<00:03:44.060> ones<00:03:44.360> another

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
colors and enable other ones another

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.750 
colors and enable other ones another
example<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.770> if<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.250> bunch<00:03:46.670> of

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
example is if you have a bunch of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.790 
example is if you have a bunch of
different<00:03:46.940> poses<00:03:47.300> at<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.230> point<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.590> time

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
different poses at this point in time

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.670 
different poses at this point in time
the<00:03:49.130> poses<00:03:49.640> replace<00:03:50.270> actual<00:03:50.630> traits<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.590> if

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the poses replace actual traits so if

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.410 
the poses replace actual traits so if
you<00:03:51.800> want<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.040> certain<00:03:52.340> pose<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.090> need<00:03:53.270> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
you want to certain pose you need to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.720 
you want to certain pose you need to
disable<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.959> poses<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.650> replace<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.370> same

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
disable the poses that replace the same

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.900 
disable the poses that replace the same
trait<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.540> again<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.830> also<00:03:58.040> very<00:03:58.400> helpful

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
trait so again this is also very helpful

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.000 
trait so again this is also very helpful
