actual<00:00:59.670> ring<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
actual ring what I like about is that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.200 
actual ring what I like about is that
it's<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.770> solid<00:01:02.190> black<00:01:02.550> ring<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's not a solid black ring it's
actually<00:01:03.449> dashed<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.589> broken<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.189> line

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
actually dashed it's a broken up line

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
actually dashed it's a broken up line
it's<00:01:05.820> sort<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> neo<00:01:07.020> glamour<00:01:07.560> series

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

have you seen it it's dashes which in my

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.960 
have you seen it it's dashes which in my
opinion<00:01:10.920> once<00:01:11.310> again<00:01:11.549> makes<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:11.939> very

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
opinion once again makes it look very

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
opinion once again makes it look very
natural<00:01:12.470> another<00:01:13.470> thing<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> makes<00:01:13.830> look

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
natural another thing that makes look

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
natural another thing that makes look
natural<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.049> blending<00:01:16.049> color<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.470> third

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
natural is the blending color the third

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
natural is the blending color the third

purchased a yellow or brownish color in
the<00:01:21.479> middle<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> helps<00:01:22.320> blend<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.799> make

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the middle and that helps blend to make

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
the middle and that helps blend to make
it<00:01:23.040> look<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.520> natural<00:01:23.939> lens<00:01:24.770> super

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770

color<00:01:25.979> /<00:01:26.250> aside<00:01:26.549> overall<00:01:27.000> I'd<00:01:27.299> give<00:01:27.360> it

color / aside overall I'd give it
probably<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.590> eight<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> half<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> 10

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
probably an eight and a half out of 10

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
probably an eight and a half out of 10
because<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.720> harsh<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.200> grey<00:01:31.380> lenses

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
because I'm really harsh on grey lenses

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
because I'm really harsh on grey lenses
as<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> look<00:01:33.750> past<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.259> on

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
as you know I like to look past out on

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.069 
as you know I like to look past out on
any<00:01:34.560> given<00:01:34.890> lighting<00:01:35.780> next<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.049> have

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
any given lighting next up we have

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.440 
any given lighting next up we have
enlargement<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.909> 14.5

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
enlargement and these are 14.5

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.830 
enlargement and these are 14.5
millimeters<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:40.409> believe<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.420> size

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
millimeters i believe so for that size

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
millimeters i believe so for that size
in<00:01:43.409> terms<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> whole<00:01:44.430> scale<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.939> lenses

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in terms of the whole scale of lenses

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
in terms of the whole scale of lenses
these<00:01:45.720> aren't<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.110> enlarging<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
these aren't then enlarging which I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.460 
these aren't then enlarging which I
prefer<00:01:47.040> I'd<00:01:47.820> give<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.420> again<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:49.020> eight<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
prefer I'd give it again an eight and a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
prefer I'd give it again an eight and a
half<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> ten<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> smallest<00:01:50.939> largest

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.499 
half out of ten not the smallest largest
but<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> difference<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
but there's a difference you can see and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.980 
but there's a difference you can see and
finally<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.290> comfort<00:01:56.250> rather<00:01:56.869> these<00:01:57.869> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
finally for comfort rather these are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
finally for comfort rather these are
from<00:01:58.079> seashell<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.890> brand<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.340> general

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
from seashell and this brand in general

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
from seashell and this brand in general
has<00:02:00.030> been<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.630> comfortable<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
has been very comfortable for me the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.350 
has been very comfortable for me the
first<00:02:02.070> day<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> wore<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:02.820> whatever

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
first day I wore these for whatever

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
first day I wore these for whatever
reason<00:02:03.780> they<00:02:03.960> were<00:02:04.020> ridiculously<00:02:04.829> drying

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
reason they were ridiculously drying

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
reason they were ridiculously drying
maybe<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> weather<00:02:06.180> outside<00:02:06.420> maybe

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
maybe it was the weather outside maybe

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
maybe it was the weather outside maybe
it<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.099> know<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.690> since<00:02:09.690> then

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it was me I don't know but since then

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.150 
it was me I don't know but since then
I've<00:02:09.989> warned<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.379> three<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:10.800> four<00:02:10.979> more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I've warned them three or four more

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710 
I've warned them three or four more
times<00:02:11.340> they've<00:02:11.730> been<00:02:11.879> perfectly<00:02:12.360> comfortable

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
times they've been perfectly comfortable

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.700 
times they've been perfectly comfortable
after<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.349> point

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
after that point

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.030 
after that point
so<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.950> guess<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> fluke<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:15.000> sorts<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so I guess it was a fluke of sorts but I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.580 
so I guess it was a fluke of sorts but I
rate<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.460> comfort<00:02:17.880> nine<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> 10<00:02:18.900> because

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
rate the comfort nine out of 10 because

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.590 
rate the comfort nine out of 10 because

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
at first I did weird me out with how dry

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.880 
at first I did weird me out with how dry
they<00:02:21.750> were<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.110> they've<00:02:22.230> been<00:02:22.350> fine<00:02:22.680> ever
