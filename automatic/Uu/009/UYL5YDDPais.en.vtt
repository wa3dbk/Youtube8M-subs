00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.249
 detention distance 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.470
 the stopping distance also called technical stopping distance is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.300
 the section traveled by a vehicle since the driver perceives the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.259
 obstacle to the total arrest of the vehicle ie 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.430
 the sum of the meters traveled during the reaction distance and the distance 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.430
 of braking 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
 safety distance between vehicles 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.660
 when we drive behind another vehicle we have to leave between both 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 enough space called safety distance 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.040
 so that in case the vehicle that precedes us stops abruptly 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 we can stop without conditioning him 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.450
 In short, it must be the sum of the distance traveled during the time of 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.720
 reaction and the braking of the vehicle 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.119
 and this security distance we have to increase according to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.190
 speed 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 lack of visibility like rain fog 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.280
 fumes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.450
 Attention conditions floor slippery gravel on the roadway 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.410
 braking conditions 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.500
 how this safety distance is calculated 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.380
 an adequate formula can be to leave a safe distance counting a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.579
 Two-second interval between two vehicles running in a row 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.280
 For this, the first step must be taken as a reference next to a point 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.410
 fixed as can be a post a tree and so on 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.350
 if at the end of the account the vehicle itself has not reached the point of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 reference the safety distance is sufficient 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.110
 otherwise the vehicle circulates too close to the other and must 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.110
 increase the separation 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.049
