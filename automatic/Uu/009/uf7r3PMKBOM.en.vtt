00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:14.910
 the last day and like yesterday 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.300
 convinced that the field of córdoba 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.519
 it's okay 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.759
 and then another for more encouraging can 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.210
 link the alternative so that the 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.120
 team is more competitive 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.270
 René is a player 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.810
 also the inter but its great season 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.410
 leader defensive cut colony 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.030
 defensive so of 68 and good peak 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.970
 mentioned there is mostly about homework 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.020
 defensive and creative work and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.200
 where I 'm sure you 'll get noticed later 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.510
 evening of glory for the cordoba and black 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.970
 as always what I say but what is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 all 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.200
 get the pressure category and I'm 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200
 convinced 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.949
 Thanks everyone 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.819
 thank you all to all the club at 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:19.069
 sports director to the president and 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:22.920
 colleagues that you have known and who have 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:25.560
 treated very well and then says that his 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.939
 position that you prefer is in front of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.939
 the defense is not midfield 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:37.590
 then of 6 but down also out 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 but the truth is that he is very happy 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 to be here that would be reaches us from 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.490
 italia what really likes football 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.980
 Spanish because also the teams 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.300
 little ones try to play and play 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.120
 matches 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.100
 It's a bit different from Italy and 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.100
 that later there will be Central American 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.050
 I have trained a lot in detail and always 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.640
 in a continuous manner and that I have done 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.450
 I always work more because it's when 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.430
 little bit 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.330
 I always tried to be ready 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.300
 great to take the field 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.940
 the formal one of a player for 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.060
 become physically butt has to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.010
 play games and you will need one of the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.670
 matches so that to catch the rhythm 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.800
 of the party and will be with him 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.290
 as you have seen already dance among the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.329
 matches 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.939
 the players have a lot of quality but 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.549
 he is not very worried because in the end 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.950
 comes from helping the Cordoba and as I have 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.750
 said the coach before training at 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.690
 final what is important is the córdoba and not 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.480
 play 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.170
 try to help the team more to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.380
 continue good we are happy the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 sports management but the difficulty to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.890
 sometimes also because the convenient 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.999
 it is very difficult not only for 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.670
 us but for all the clubs and the 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.840
 general leader we are very satisfied and 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.700
 the satisfaction of all for the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.420
 people that we have been 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.280
 working to make it that way and well I think 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.280
 which is really a step forward 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.360
 the aunts 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.349
 we are in full body tuning 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.310
 technical with the president as all 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:46.489
 we want and you also the hobby 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.410
 above all that we all go together and 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.130
 the goal what from now on goes 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.680
 to be a very competitive league as it is 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.180
 being on the computers at those times and 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:04.790
 where we not only have to 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.970
 although everything from the club by part of 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.490
 the players at the end 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.440
 If we are not together, always that 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.450
 event 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.900
 good at the end of the situation the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.900
 workshop 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.410
 that will be the one to have the possibility of 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.200
 that because the moment like now can 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.770
 can you sign any other 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.060
 software that no no it can not be he's going to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.580
 have a different possibility to the rest 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.900
 that the play that was paid to them can 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.419
 sign in any other second club 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.690
 division decisions about session in this 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.660
 case that output has also been facilitated 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.370
 with which the truth that with those that do not 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.370
 they would be correct to your gentleman
