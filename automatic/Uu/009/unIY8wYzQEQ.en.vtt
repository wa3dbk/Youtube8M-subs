00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.540
 Thank you in advance for this 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.790
 Today you will be able to hear a story with your guest Mr. Kazuhiro Mochida 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.180
 Thank you for your event 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:20.080
 Well , I would like to ask you today 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:25.240
 July 12 a joint communication 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:30.920
 340 tons of contaminated water for agricultural water 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:42.329
 Under the title of approval of plan by JAEA 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 It was said that 340 tons of polluted water generated in Minamisoma City was being sent to a mother who used it for agricultural water 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 It is said 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.320
 Yes The radiocesium control standards established by JAEA 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.630
 Yes 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.970
 Though it is less than the maximum grade 10 Becquer per 1 liter 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:04.720
 Employees to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.519
 It contains 60 tons of water of 100 to 1201 becquerel over it. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.009
 Yes 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:20.940
 The total amount of spilled radioactive material it's a thing Rutteyuu me at 16 million, but the Oiwa's now 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 What is the maximum of 10 becquerles per liter you mentioned? 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:33.810
 If it is the value written in the law and the waste liquid of more nodes, take it out of the office, 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.530
 It is the value with such a moat not to be 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.040
 Japan because it 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:46.720
 In order to be a company or a so-called researcher or something like this, this standard must 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 Although it is worth saying that only you have to keep 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.550
 Also times liquid, such as those above it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.820
 Nuclear mechanism had and the attendant flow is like a kind of story that it was aware of it 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.030
 Is it 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.600
 This that the largest 10 becquerels much the same criteria you from the reference Yes long ago Tteyuu below 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 You will either Well Description 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:20.200
 Historically speaking, the numbers have changed in detail, but from a long time ago 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 a. For the Tesem 137, the number 90 becquerels per liter 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.130
 I think that it is continuing for about 20 years 30 years . 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:45.160
 Say what when it comes go interest Patty paralysis Aso 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.600
 Somehow it's probably Capa 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.300
 Required Yes this is probably so wonder if not it was to this kind of thing because I got to remember 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.920
 That 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.350
 And it has already been 4 release large amounts of radioactive materials 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 First whole 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:07.040
 It is that it is furiously dirty 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:14.989
 It is no longer possible to manage it all under the public before 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 For that purpose, for example, ordinary people in the case of a staff should have 1 millisievert per year. 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.390
 Though it was public until now 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:27.780
 It is 203 that one does not have such a thing anymore 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:31.520
 The government of Japan is in the place where people can live to say 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.820
 Because that's already 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.790
 In the situation where it can not be protected voluntarily that the concentration in the waste liquid can not be protected any more 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.160
 It has become 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:50.700
 So far also of the window and the other possibly because it is well aware also that the Japan Atomic Energy Piku 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:56.459
 I think that's why I can not protect 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:00.470
 I'd like to ask you to review that little bit, but this came out for decontamination 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.120
 Ash I such that say the contaminated water is coming out in the work of the route 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.990
 Well, that's what I say decontamination work 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.990
 In the roof of the nursery school this high pressure washer example Yes it is or sink that groove 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.980
 But it is normal 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.880
 That basic first of Tteyuu the water 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:27.350
 How are you saying you're collecting really ? 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:31.040
 Don't let the water you used in high pressure washing go that way 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:35.969
 Also for you but are supposed to be Collect 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:41.579
 It takes But keep in to not be far from work when I do such a thing 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:46.229
 That would next unpleasant Well then flow to is why came also to this because meet 

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:47.569
 5000 were also be I say drop fishing in the river was listed Well Asahi Shimbun before 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.550
 But 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:54.569
 Maybe I do it on a daily basis 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:58.379
 I have no choice but I'm sure now it 's on the scene 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:05.129
 When it comes to work, such one by one drainage large 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:08.750
 It is also possible at first to pack and store all the pits for eating and everything today . 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:15.080
 I think that you think is in perhaps the field to Fu say that there is no 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:20.750
 If you're asking me that decontamination itself is probably that illusion 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 It is as you say and I think we close to fiction because that decontamination except for the dirt 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.540
 Although it is not written 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.740
 Dirt and what we are calling not take radioactivity 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:34.020
 Original and never say turn off the radioactivity 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:38.819
 Can not brook Speaking in its original meaning can not be the words and 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:44.160
 You mentioned this program before in the earth, but Jen seems to be in line 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:48.729
 Though we can only move the breast case 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:53.030
 Because the money for the move has become too large 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:06:00.290
 It 's supposed to be flowing all over the place anyway 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:06.710
 Then Well Koide Well With its decontamination now take a look from the eyes of the teacher that this country is 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:10.130
 Led to this overall but I think you're doing is making a that implementation plan 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.020
 Do you think it makes sense to do this decontamination work? 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:18.629
 I am the first to oppose that decontamination 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:24.150
 The most important thing is to miss people in the contaminated area 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:25.740
 By mistake is itself to say that I say can decontaminate contaminated areas do such of the was to 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:33.009
 I think that there 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:35.780
 However, this decontamination is what is called a decontamination business , so far gauge 6 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:41.660
 Is Toka I built has promoted now 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:46.580
 What I 've Ever Made If I Raised My Only Family Who Has Been Earned By Building A Nuclear Power Station 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:52.400
 This because you're doing things like that that make money now and in the Korean business 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:55.800
 If you invest about 11 billion yen in business budget, it is 9 volumes of 11 billion yen. 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.490
 Hey, this one is sure to be hundreds of billions of yen 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:04.830
 I think I spent maybe Toka fueled in 2011, 2012 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:09.470
 Thousands would have standing to billion yen recorded in there now seed fiscal 2012 national budget here 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:16.910
 Decontamination costs Yes Takane about 3700 Burger pass 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:17.750
 So it's a long time ago that the water that I had washed away into the cow water is out there, but I don't know where to go 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:26.830
 Right 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:30.430
 He will eventually go to luck while being used for agricultural water through 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:35.800
 It deviates from the efficacy pure also in the meantime in this underground 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:36.850
 I swear where I'm in the basement while dirtying the classic putter that of course the bar 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.280
 By the by and say, 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:44.120
 I think in the end we will form the sea 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:48.320
 I say also another also the last line 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.370
 The last thing is that everything from the environment is connected. 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.000
 Why 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:58.440
 a 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.260
 There is also a case where you move from a contaminated place to an unprotected place. 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:08.210
 Briefly Yes I can not I originally that curb the pollution 

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:13.270
 That's why is the coin Yes you say street to say Datte primary guy useless 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.270
 Yes Thank Yes Thank you very much, Mr. time
