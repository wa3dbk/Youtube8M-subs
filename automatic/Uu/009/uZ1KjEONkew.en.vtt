00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:10.910
 the one in this good house rather this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.910
 nation toni this so let's start 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 on the map good at the stone house and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 start well they are swimming nothing but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.369
 Steal 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.080
 mandiÃ¡ is a super mansion carried by 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.600
 as you know our eye again 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.129
 I almost always do mystery things 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.780
 to charm me between maps 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.550
 because many of you are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 they download and they like what I do 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 I mean what you dug and this goes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 to come for saying so creative you know 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.150
 if they want to change it simply because 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.479
 they look for a tutorial how to change to 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.809
 survival with eric singer see if 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.430
 have if they do not have grass so 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.270
 we are from here there are a lot of things 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 they will see story 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.910
 let's first see her a look through 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.430
 outside this would be the super mega pool 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.850
 A) Yes 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 this mere who are here around 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.000
 see let's go into the pool 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.080
 to nothing then I take off the sky 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.060
 beautiful that great many actions 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.760
 thank you and it's great because now 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.369
 how do we have this from the Spanish that we 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.050
 he brought the well if you do not know who 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.090
 is with him so just look in 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.090
 your youtube 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 and the train tutorial how to translate your 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.230
 greater exposure to Spanish 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.670
 so we went down here 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.009
 and then here is what it would be 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.400
 to this I really believe because that 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.070
 It seems like a car, I do not know, I do not know what the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.439
 truthfully there is clarified this is 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.860
 the entrance is where we come from there 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.150
 you can enter 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.290
 and 20m at the moment I think it's the garage 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.369
 let's see what data has tony stark 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.370
 this is the garage we will really advance 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.680
 advancing neither being praise said 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.190
 because that's because this map is 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.260
 pretty big so that's why it's or 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.590
 how much data do you have with being in series 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.760
 which is great I'm going to be rich 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.600
 have a house like what will they have 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.970
 later to see we are going to come back here 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.700
 I do not even know where to go even 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.680
 I know where I 'm going I just go there 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.800
 visiting and I do not know why I'll be so 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.080
 black I think I do not know why they are lines 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.880
 blacks in that case simply destroy 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.170
 a block if you remove all the black but not 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.090
 I want them to be extracting their 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.470
 because the world obviously later what 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.270
 they put the block back, although right now 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.830
 I have stone at hand because I have 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.830
 the gel and to make them a super review 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.260

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.590

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.690
 unique youtuber of sip and in spanish that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.300

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.730
 in any case good not this point of 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.220
 arrive has like 190 something like that and then 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.010
 there is one called mister law the uah 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.810
 charge if you have 170 videos in them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.600
 they are also about to reach the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.390
 200 videos 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 we can now start here where 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.120
 I'm going to see a moment, we're going through here , 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.310
 they require things obviously because 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.870
 there are some things here I think it landed a 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.840
 helicopter I do not know let's build us good 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.590
 let's say that garlic is me 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.600
 subtracting a lot wake to see we are 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.870
 here that is here 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.580
 this is hey kind of like desk and in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.300
 zero what bothers me the most is one of 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.790
 both the lines of the whites the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.220
 black lines I got stuck talking locked me 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.700
 speaking one piano like in the other 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.879
 Mansion 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.910
 let's see what's here and there for 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.739
 here and it brought me rather not about the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.500
 video but what it does is an action ups 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.079
 for all maps and all that so 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.669
 Well, nothing more than the map would be 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.579
 not be everything but we 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.160
 also visit and as I say it is a 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.110
 great house only that how can not 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.410
 activate me des mots line and I can not 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.150
 put me the beautiful skies the water 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.580
 animated already know that I believe myself is not 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.979
 very nice but I'm not buying at 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.370
 buy an iphone 5 in this case there yes 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.860
 This would have all this because this 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.180
 is a better device I could already put 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 our texture in the series about see 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.500
 up on a roll of maps and giants to 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.690
 It could have texture but also not so 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.690
 giant because it's neither that nor on ipad and 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.220
 it's good that it starts so good 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.290
