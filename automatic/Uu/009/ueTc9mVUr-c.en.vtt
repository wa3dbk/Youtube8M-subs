00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.080
 gul'dan strong black 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.060
 and a great strategist who was a student 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.750
 Supreme Shaman Ner'zhul 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.600
 when the orcs still lived in draenor he 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.580
 diligently studied dark magic and when 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.520
 Kil'jaeden offered him more 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.840
 force in exchange for dedication agreed 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.940
 bow before the flaming legion 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.180
 the demon taught the young shaman to address 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.820
 with the departed and cry to the ghosts as well 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.550
 helped the orc to gain magical powers from 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.180
 whirling void bringing it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.240
 abilities greatly increased gul'dan 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.330
 created a shadow council studying dark 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.590
 magic and ruling horde and in fact 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.280
 became the leader of the horde 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.920
 those who disagreed with him were 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.170
 destroyed the shadow council 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.960
 studied the whirling void in the hope 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.360
 find a rational form of life and far from 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.369
 draenor 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.860
 once in a gul'danâ€™s mind penetrated medivals and 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 tried to learn more about it through him 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.209
 draenor 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.810
 gul'dan turn tried more 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:42.670
 learn about the world mediva wise div gave 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 shaman knowledge only crumbs 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.929
 I do not allow to see anything concrete 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.840
 gul'dan 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.300
 turn also tried to give 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.080
 to the great magician of people as little as possible 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.170
 information more Gul'dan realized that 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.770
 Mediv is so strong that he fears him 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.050
 lord of the burning legion kil'jaeden but 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.090
 gul'dan did not understand what all the same 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.819
 wants to see 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.479
 after the medivh opened the portal to the world 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.590
 people 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.840
 the orcs began their raids on azero first 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.080
 the attacks failed and the gul'dan helped 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.519
 Blackhand have become leader of the horde knowing that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.489
 will be able to manage the mediv ordered the gul'dan 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.269
 destroy the bases of the people of stormgrad and 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.390
 make him lord of azeroth gul'dan 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 it did not suit however he did not 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 I could do it all the more because the mediva knew 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.280
 location of the tomb of Sargeras 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 containing powerful force 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.480
 the much needed gul'dan when the mediv 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.549
 by the hand of kadgar, gul'dan felt it 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.090
 and frantically tried to find a place 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.940
 burial of dark titanium 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.830
 at the time of death the mind of mind is gul'dan and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.910
 was connected with the mind of medivh 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.700
 as a result, the arch fell into a coma 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.640
 he stayed a long time and when he came 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.970
 himself then discovered that his puppet 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.849
 Blackhand killed or make-up with a lesson hammer 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.790
 he himself was given lost a lot of energy 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.200
 time of sleep 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.780
 then the gul'dan swore allegiance 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.720
 new leader 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.269
 to save your life gul'dan 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.000
 created an army of death and frozen knights 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.140
 knights of people and souls of dead sorcerers 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.180
 shadow council this mighty army 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.620
 chernokonk nikov allowed ardi to conquer 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.599
 the vast territory of Azeroth without leaving 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.500
 my plans to find the tomb 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.750
 sargerasa 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
 and get huge in fact 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.860
 divine power 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.500
 gul'dan betrayed orgrim at the moment of decisive 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.709
 battle and led his clan raging storm 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.790
 and the tower of the river hammer on 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.340
 search for the tomb of Sargeras for this orgrim 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.310
 sent part of his army for traitor 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.519
 his clan to punish them for such 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.190
 perfidy ultimately weakened horde 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.209
 He was defeated in a battle with the people and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.880
 Horde leader miraculously escaped the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.910
 in time, the gul'dan raised a whole of water 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.610
 archipelago of islands on one of which 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.330
 and rested the remains of the creator of the blazing 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.660
 legion but all minions gul'dan and 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.910
 the tombs were killed by the demons and 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 the punitive squad hammer rock 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.030
 sent to destroy the traitor mage 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.669
 gul'dan himself died torn to pieces 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.450
 enraged by the servants of the Sargeras 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.849
 sharpened with him and set free 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.070
 dying year inscribed on the walls of the tomb 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.500
 your last blood message 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.830
 the gul'dan skull was still found and 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.090
 delivered to draenor afterwards this 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.490
 mighty artifact 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.460
