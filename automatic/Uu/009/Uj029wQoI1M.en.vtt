00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.559 
sometimes it can be awkward to get the
beam<00:02:18.709> where<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.100> want<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.730> these<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.209> find

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
beam where you want it on these I find

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.270 
beam where you want it on these I find
them<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:20.959> much<00:02:21.170> easier<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.870> AAA<00:02:24.050> battery

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
them so much easier one AAA battery

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.400 
them so much easier one AAA battery
inside<00:02:25.280> they've<00:02:26.209> made<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.599> simple<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.230> can

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
inside they've made it simple you can

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.230 
inside they've made it simple you can
really<00:02:27.770> change<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.280> quite<00:02:28.610> easily<00:02:28.819> in<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
really change this quite easily in the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.020 
really change this quite easily in the
dark<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.870> there's<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.200> battery<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.760> just

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
dark and there's the battery it just

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.880 
dark and there's the battery it just
slots<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.570> there<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.170> then<00:02:33.380> gets<00:02:33.590> clicked

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
slots in there and then gets clicked

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.880 
slots in there and then gets clicked
into<00:02:34.100> place<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.750> I've<00:02:35.750> tried<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
into place and I've tried to do this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.150 
into place and I've tried to do this
dark<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.250> few<00:02:37.460> times<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.030> works<00:02:38.210> easy<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
dark a few times and it works easy the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.740 
dark a few times and it works easy the
different<00:02:40.610> settings<00:02:40.880> you've<00:02:41.180> got<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.569> is

torch the one that I really like this
straight<00:02:44.330> away<00:02:44.360> they've<00:02:44.750> put<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.110> red<00:02:45.350> spot

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
straight away they've put the red spot

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.559 
straight away they've put the red spot
on<00:02:45.950> there<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.760> doesn't<00:02:47.209> muck<00:02:47.360> your

that the old Reds fault
brilliant<00:02:54.080> I'll<00:02:54.800> probably<00:02:55.100> use<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.520> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
brilliant I'll probably use that the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.600 
brilliant I'll probably use that the
most<00:02:56.080> give<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.170> another<00:02:57.410> person<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.430> this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
most give it another person you get this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.670 
most give it another person you get this
massive<00:02:59.120> beam<00:02:59.600> which<00:02:59.870> will<00:03:00.020> light<00:03:00.320> up<00:03:00.470> your

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
massive beam which will light up your
