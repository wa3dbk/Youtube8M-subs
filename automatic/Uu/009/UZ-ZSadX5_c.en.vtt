00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.160
 people around the world are kissing 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.680
 to his partner the people closer and in 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.890
 this time we are going to see my dear 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.890
 a red against green because no 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.520
 this one was pretty simple 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.460
 as you can see it reduces the damage by 25% and 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.449
 extra the video before the attackers when 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.240
 know they are not psychic well then 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.750
 let's take advantage of stability 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.550
 you can not see a low much and out of 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.090
 that I'm going to put negative states 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.090
 to the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.390
 or you can see it kept coming down life and 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.260
 apart 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.239
 I have life because of this we are going to repeat 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.350
 this thing until we have 90 by 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.870
 a hundred of being hot are cooking and 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.489
 then if we are going to attack but until 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.650
 we have put together but as you can see 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:11.330
 he lowers his life pretty well just 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.330
 and I do not get much damage 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.119
 we keep descending 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.710
 today it was on fire I did not say 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.780
 we have to do skills so that 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.570
 we are not at 100% fever 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.909
 because if I do not lose turn and it's not so 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.640
 good that 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.500
 how can you see 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.180
 to this here says we're going to make 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 this things from 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.429
 our fever to lower lives 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 well reduces us by 30% of the fever 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.350
 that we had 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.860
 and now if we are going to put more 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 fever 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 as you can see this battery is very 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.329
 simple if you know how to pass them 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.640
 It's one thing to be defending until 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.980
 for the same kill 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.590
 well let's see if we get the ready that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:31.520
 I do not know what he does, I think the hulk says 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.100
 that you resist damage the streams is the damage 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.140
 and resistance to critical hits while 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.430
 that the son the red starts the battle 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.350
 with 40% of both are heated more 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 or less well let's see if we can get 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.319
 any 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.550
 very well very well we grabbed the hulk 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.540
 well this is all for this delivery we 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.540
 we see in the next
