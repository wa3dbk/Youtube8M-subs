the blade on the g10 I'm going to ATM
it's<00:01:44.380> milling<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.069> I<00:01:45.099> can't<00:01:45.340> think<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.970> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's milling but I can't think of a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.749 
it's milling but I can't think of a
specific<00:01:47.920> term<00:01:48.459> for<00:01:48.819> it<00:01:48.910> right<00:01:49.030> now<00:01:50.759> it's

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
specific term for it right now it's

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.589 
specific term for it right now it's
really<00:01:52.030> clean<00:01:52.270> lines<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:55.060> kind<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.300> smooth

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
really clean lines it's kind of smooth

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.290 
really clean lines it's kind of smooth
little<00:01:56.050> slippery<00:01:56.610> there's<00:01:57.610> no<00:01:57.759> chipping<00:01:58.060> on

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300

the<00:01:58.330> back<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:58.750> blade<00:01:59.940> that's<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.060> really

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
the back of the blade that's a really

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.150 
the back of the blade that's a really
nice<00:02:01.450> size<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:01.780> EDC<00:02:02.940> could<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.270> next<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.660> a

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
nice size for EDC could see it next to a

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.330 
nice size for EDC could see it next to a
large<00:02:06.160> sebenza<00:02:06.670> right<00:02:07.000> here<00:02:10.770> both<00:02:11.770> sides<00:02:12.099> it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
large sebenza right here both sides it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180 
large sebenza right here both sides it
has<00:02:12.370> quite<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.300> bit<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.540> cutting-edge<00:02:14.190> not

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
has quite a bit of cutting-edge not

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.220 
has quite a bit of cutting-edge not
obviously<00:02:15.940> not<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.239> much<00:02:16.360> as<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.569> large<00:02:16.840> sebenza

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
obviously not as much as a large sebenza

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.710 
obviously not as much as a large sebenza
but<00:02:17.700> quite<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.970> for<00:02:19.120> its<00:02:19.270> size<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:22.450> really

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
but quite a bit for its size it's really

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:35.009 
but quite a bit for its size it's really
smooth<00:02:24.150> strong<00:02:25.150> detent

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.069 

fit<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.140> finish<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.590> superb<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.159> this<00:02:38.079> is

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
fit and finish is superb on this is

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.339 
fit and finish is superb on this is
actually<00:02:39.409> the<00:02:39.500> first<00:02:39.530> writer<00:02:40.129> I<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.760> owned

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
actually the first writer I have owned

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.170 
actually the first writer I have owned
but<00:02:42.349> effort<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.310> people<00:02:43.519> say<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
but effort a lot of people say that the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.800 
but effort a lot of people say that the
initial<00:02:44.840> knees<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.590> pretty<00:02:46.189> good<00:02:46.810> it's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
initial knees is pretty good it's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.619 
initial knees is pretty good it's
actually<00:02:47.959> top-notch<00:02:49.269> you'll<00:02:50.269> notice<00:02:50.540> right

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
actually top-notch you'll notice right

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.259 
actually top-notch you'll notice right
away<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:52.519> uses<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.940> stop<00:02:53.329> in<00:02:53.860> instead<00:02:54.860> of

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
away that it uses a stop in instead of

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.839 
away that it uses a stop in instead of
studs<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:57.859> thumb<00:02:58.099> stud<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.670> blade

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
studs can like thumb stud for the blade

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.910 
studs can like thumb stud for the blade
stops<00:02:59.180> a<00:03:02.170> little<00:03:03.170> bit<00:03:03.290> different<00:03:03.650> than<00:03:03.799> with

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
stops a little bit different than with

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.099 
stops a little bit different than with
traditional<00:03:04.400> striders<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.359> single<00:03:08.720> screw

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
traditional striders just a single screw

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.509

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.490 
for the pocket clip mmm no lanyard hole
not<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.549> big<00:03:16.790> deal<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.060> don't<00:03:17.569> really<00:03:18.139> care<00:03:18.379> about

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
already know it changed the way they did

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.140 
already know it changed the way they did
the<00:03:25.639> lock<00:03:25.819> bar<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.239> these<00:03:26.560> they<00:03:27.560> do<00:03:27.620> them<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:27.950> lot

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
the lock bar on these they do them a lot

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.229 
the lock bar on these they do them a lot
with<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.420> lot<00:03:29.720> less<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.319> an<00:03:31.010> angle<00:03:31.989> similar<00:03:32.989> to
