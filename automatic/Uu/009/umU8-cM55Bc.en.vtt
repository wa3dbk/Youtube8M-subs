bolt head on a 6 bolt block you need to

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.310 
bolt head on a 6 bolt block you need to
enlarge<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.939> head<00:00:24.089> bolt<00:00:24.300> holes<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> see

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
enlarge the head bolt holes so you see

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
enlarge the head bolt holes so you see
there<00:00:25.589> are<00:00:25.679> two<00:00:25.830> parts<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.490> job<00:00:26.759> I<00:00:27.060> only

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
there are two parts to that job I only

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
there are two parts to that job I only
showed<00:00:27.749> you<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.289> video<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.890> found

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
showed you one in that video I found

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.069 
showed you one in that video I found
this<00:00:29.789> video<00:00:29.999> behind<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> stove

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
this video behind the stove

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.720 
this video behind the stove
I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.589> caboose<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.099> playing<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
I think caboose was playing with it and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
I think caboose was playing with it and
lost<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.150> there<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.900> just<00:00:34.020> had<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> dig<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
lost it there but I just had to dig it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.410 
lost it there but I just had to dig it
out<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> share<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:35.579> after<00:00:35.760> Mike

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
out and share it with you after Mike

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.670 
out and share it with you after Mike
leveled<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> table<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.379> Bridgeport

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
leveled the table of the Bridgeport

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
leveled the table of the Bridgeport
using<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> 1/2<00:00:38.699> inch<00:00:38.850> drill<00:00:39.180> bit<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.660> drilled

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
using a 1/2 inch drill bit we drilled

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
using a 1/2 inch drill bit we drilled
every<00:00:40.050> single<00:00:40.469> hole<00:00:40.620> except<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.340> half

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
every single hole except for one half

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
every single hole except for one half
inch<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.480> twelve<00:00:42.750> point<00:00:42.960> seven<00:00:43.199> millimeters

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
inch is twelve point seven millimeters

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
inch is twelve point seven millimeters
so<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.250> roughly<00:00:44.550> point<00:00:44.879> eight

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so that's roughly point eight

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.849 
so that's roughly point eight
millimeters<00:00:45.600> larger<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.320> hole<00:00:46.469> than<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
millimeters larger of a hole than the

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.099 
millimeters larger of a hole than the
stud<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> we're<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.329> showing<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> tenth

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
stud is we're only showing you the tenth

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.990 
stud is we're only showing you the tenth
hole<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.649> reasons<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.370> being<00:00:50.609> that<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hole for two reasons one being that it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970 
hole for two reasons one being that it
doubles<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.600> oil<00:00:51.750> supply<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.949> other

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
doubles as an oil supply and the other

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.349 
doubles as an oil supply and the other
is<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.609> we<00:00:53.789> almost<00:00:54.120> fell<00:00:54.329> asleep

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
is because we almost fell asleep

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.020 
is because we almost fell asleep
drilling<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.440> nine<00:00:55.710> poor<00:00:56.309> Mike<00:00:56.579> guys

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
drilling the first nine poor Mike guys

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
drilling the first nine poor Mike guys
got<00:00:57.269> so<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.600> talent<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.440> making

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
got so much talent and all I'm making

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
got so much talent and all I'm making
him<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.129> grunt<00:00:59.399> work<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.850> drill<00:01:00.090> holes

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
him do is grunt work like drill holes

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
him do is grunt work like drill holes
sorry<00:01:01.140> bro<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> guess<00:01:01.769> it's<00:01:01.920> 5<00:01:02.160> o'clock

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
sorry bro I guess it's 5 o'clock

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.640 
sorry bro I guess it's 5 o'clock
somewhere<00:01:02.789> else<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.929> also<00:01:04.110> saved<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
somewhere else we also saved the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.290 
somewhere else we also saved the
teardrop<00:01:05.070> hole<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.489> last<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
teardrop hole for last because it's the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.850 
teardrop hole for last because it's the
only<00:01:06.480> one<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.750> needs<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.290> extra<00:01:07.590> work

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
only one that needs a little extra work

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
only one that needs a little extra work
a<00:01:08.190> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> people<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.000> drill<00:01:09.330> all<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.660> them

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a lot of people just drill all of them

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.180 
a lot of people just drill all of them
out<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> half-inch<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.800> call<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.160> day

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
out with a half-inch and call it a day

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.130 
out with a half-inch and call it a day
cuz<00:01:11.910> you'll<00:01:12.060> notice<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.630> countersink

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
cuz you'll notice there's a countersink

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.900 
cuz you'll notice there's a countersink
almost<00:01:13.500> 3/4<00:01:13.980> of<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.160> inch<00:01:14.280> into<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.700> head

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
almost 3/4 of an inch into the head

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.030 
almost 3/4 of an inch into the head
that's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> oil<00:01:15.840> gallery<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.800> want<00:01:16.980> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's the oil gallery and I want to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.650 
that's the oil gallery and I want to
countersink<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.730> with<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> larger<00:01:18.300> bit<00:01:18.510> in

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
countersink it with a larger bit in

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.570 
countersink it with a larger bit in
order<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> maintain<00:01:19.170> its<00:01:19.530> internal<00:01:20.010> volume<00:01:20.160> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
order to maintain its internal volume I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.510 
order to maintain its internal volume I
recommend<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> 37<00:01:21.990> 64th<00:01:22.560> inch<00:01:22.800> drill<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.160> for

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
recommend a 37 64th inch drill bit for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.400 
recommend a 37 64th inch drill bit for
this<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.180> fourteen<00:01:24.720> point<00:01:25.020> six<00:01:25.260> eight

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
this which is fourteen point six eight

this which is fourteen point six eight
millimeters<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.130> asked<00:01:26.730> Mike<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:26.970> drill<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.510> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
millimeters I asked Mike to drill down a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.360 
millimeters I asked Mike to drill down a
few<00:01:27.840> millimeters<00:01:28.260> deeper<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.800> intersect<00:01:29.280> with

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
few millimeters deeper to intersect with

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.530 
few millimeters deeper to intersect with

power<00:04:33.060> out<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.539> big<00:04:33.750> 16<00:04:34.080> G<00:04:34.440> than<00:04:34.650> most<00:04:34.830> other

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.010 
power out of a big 16 G than most other
people<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.940> decreased<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.539> size<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
people it decreased the size of the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.629 
people it decreased the size of the
combustion<00:04:37.350> chamber<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:37.860> very<00:04:38.250> slightly

combustion chamber and very slightly

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.879

decrease<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.360> Clinch<00:04:39.600> area<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.410> because<00:04:40.740> it

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
decrease the Clinch area but because it

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.439 
decrease the Clinch area but because it
would<00:04:41.009> have<00:04:41.100> put<00:04:41.280> nine<00:04:41.729> thousandths<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.330> an

make it fit there you go that was my

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.230 
make it fit there you go that was my
secret<00:04:48.830> using<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.889> thicker<00:04:50.130> MLS<00:04:50.639> gasket<00:04:51.090> will

secret using a thicker MLS gasket will

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.850 
secret using a thicker MLS gasket will
increase<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.780> valve<00:04:51.960> clearance<00:04:52.229> as<00:04:52.500> well<00:04:52.710> as

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
increase the valve clearance as well as

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.529 
increase the valve clearance as well as
the<00:04:53.009> quench<00:04:53.250> area<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.150> size<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.479> the
