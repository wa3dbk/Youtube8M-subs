00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.170 
it grows back in is wavy so I tend to
get<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> lot<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.079> flyaways<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.180> after

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
get a lot of flyaways up here after

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
get a lot of flyaways up here after
about<00:01:51.420> six<00:01:51.960> months<00:01:52.110> um<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.729> going

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
about six months um so it's really going

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.950 
about six months um so it's really going
to<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.030> different<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.750> each<00:01:54.899> person

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
to be different for each person

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.620 
to be different for each person
depending<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> your<00:01:56.100> hair<00:01:56.369> texture<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
depending on your hair texture and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.660 
depending on your hair texture and
things<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.490> hair

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
things like that so this is what my hair

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.630 
things like that so this is what my hair
looks<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> um<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.009> know<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.159> guess<00:02:02.369> I'll<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
looks like um I know I guess I'll do a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
looks like um I know I guess I'll do a
quick<00:02:02.880> spin<00:02:03.149> um<00:02:06.320> not<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> whole<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.920> say

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
quick spin um not a whole lot to say

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.639 
quick spin um not a whole lot to say
about<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:09.149> pretty<00:02:09.690> straight<00:02:10.379> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
about it it's still pretty straight I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.309 
about it it's still pretty straight I
don't<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> flat<00:02:11.610> iron<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.940> have

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
don't use a flat iron I have

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.699 
don't use a flat iron I have
really<00:02:12.530> used<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:12.890> flat<00:02:13.099> iron<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.840> months<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
really used a flat iron in months and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.470 
really used a flat iron in months and
months<00:02:15.859> and<00:02:16.040> months<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.310> months<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:17.239> may

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
months and months and months so I may

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.449 
months and months and months so I may
have<00:02:17.599> used<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.139> once<00:02:18.409> or<00:02:18.590> twice<00:02:18.739> just<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.189> kind

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
have used it once or twice just to kind

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.530 
have used it once or twice just to kind
of<00:02:19.579> um<00:02:20.439> straighten<00:02:21.439> out<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.590> little<00:02:22.010> bit<00:02:22.159> more

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
um I did a ton of research I've been

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.569 
um I did a ton of research I've been
doing<00:02:51.199> it<00:02:51.319> since<00:02:51.469> I<00:02:51.680> was<00:02:53.109> 14<00:02:54.109> or<00:02:54.439> 15<00:02:54.799> once<00:02:55.489> a

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
doing it since I was 14 or 15 once a

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.809 
doing it since I was 14 or 15 once a
year<00:02:55.790> since<00:02:56.569> then<00:02:56.840> i'll<00:02:57.739> probably<00:02:58.069> go<00:02:58.549> another
