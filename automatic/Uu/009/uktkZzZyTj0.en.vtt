00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 Then let's take a look at what happens if you take a picture with something like this 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.720
 Finally this happy day has come 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:20.440
 Which probably r file component char chan Now Which is 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:24.790
 r and I favorability model here came out in s is the water to alpha 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:31.119
 It looks like it does not change at all with the alpha set ball 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.710
 Comfort only different but life of a child just there it was little I accessories and I wonder if has changed in 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.070
 If I thought to have been attached to the person of the alpha 7 r 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.920
 Battery is this one, but alpha 7 s person 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:49.190
 It is the same as the battery but the design is a little different 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:53.449
 And this battery is also included 2 more 2 more 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.700
 It is a charger, and I feel like it was different when it was alpha 7 r 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.620
 but 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:04.680
 A charger has been attached, which means that 4 types can be output here 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:10.770
 I think there are many people who open this lid and use the cable as it is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 In this in it is what say cable protector Yes this way was attached to the main body 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.710
 The cable is good so the cable is hard to fall down 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.920
 I Kedomo I think not for the pro-peptidic so that there is no ball 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.869
 Oh dear 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.950
 It is written here in hdmi gang and Kane true if or that earphone 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:32.380
 Is it Jack ? 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:34.479
 ISO sensitivity to I want power on make easy-to-understand is we now have in Re princess formula 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.909
 Is a product for sale 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.960
 磯 400,000 0006 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.399
 Let's see what happens if you take a picture with a customer 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.780
 We started to move the darkest place of our house 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:56.600
 I'm do not see what would have reflected example, for example, Iso 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 It generally is 3200 this about is the kana would not in your upper limit 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 Iso good line 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.320
 Changed to 400 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.770
 I can't see it yet. Let's increase the sensitivity a little further. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.300
 Ist 12,800 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.650
 To use it on a regular basis, everyone is not this limit 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.379
 Would you like to raise it a little more 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.520
 It looks're ISO 25,600 faint reflected something 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:31.420
 I can see a bit faint I'll give you more 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:36.600
 磯 51200 has come to understand what is reflected 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 Better yet Yahata, which will further increase but much is still 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.190
 Better yet 102400 that I wonder about the same as looking at roughly the naked eye it is about this 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.480
 It is feeling 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.680
 It's a toilet, the toilet bowl is reflected 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.960
 Let's increase the sensitivity further Down 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.480
 8,000 128,000 yen 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.550
 It is brighter than the naked eye 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.550
 Yes 160,000 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.600
 800 204800 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 256,000 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.460
 It is overwhelmingly brighter than looking at 320,000 with the naked eye 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 And Nishikawachi 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:29.010
 It's just 409600 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:34.590
 Well, though it is rather rough of the image of Hortan small neta disease, but also 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.770
 I would think the kana not that I use I was a rough condition of about How about this 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.560
 Ne 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.710
 Let me lower it a little more Let me lower it a little more 128,000 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.320
 It is brighter than we see with some naked eyes 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:55.790
 It is a level that I can not use this while feeling all the way in the image 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.750
 Ne Charmi shutter speed 1/50 lens through f 4 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.770
 I'm shooting in the open 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.240
 No, I can only say that it is great 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.290
 Well today I am up to here about breaking news, but if you have any questions please comment in the comments 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.290
 I wish So is
