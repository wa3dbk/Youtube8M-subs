00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 no everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.740
 video we are here in the games of the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.569
 hungry that will start now and we go on 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
 the same team I used to go and today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 let's play against balashov and such that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.019
 You can also watch sophie's camera 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.639
 when he's on the other team then 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 we are here the games of hunger ' 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 we have a pretty big map in the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 that there are weapons and something hiding that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 we can use from minute 58 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 we can already start to kill us 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 something else from the minute we have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.840
 stayed 50 if we do not meet if not 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.949
 we kill ourselves we can start using 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.359
 the radar to see where the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 enemies and it's going to be the most exciting thing 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.110
 then some corwin strategy now 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 The strategy is not to fall 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.530
 important principle because we have 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.480
 all the weapons down here are 13 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.040
 seconds 12 seconds only and very 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 important to catch weapons at the beginning we 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 he went up, that is, we split up our weapons 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 at the beginning yes so that we have all 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 if there are three seconds left jose minimum 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.220
 care one come on let's go let's go 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.450
 Come on, let's go, ya bastard back 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.450
 and I fall to the water 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.870
 I do not know how I did it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 OK 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.060
 let's go where we throw corvus right or 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.590
 coming from the front 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.620
 follow me around here I think more or 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 less for this zone 30 seconds to 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.220
 start killing us 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 here 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.470
 get in the bathroom look for the bazooka 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.450
 because I think it's for another area 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.700
 let's put together that you go 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.800
 walking you go back by bus if I 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.470
 they could kill a rough case of a glass 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.540
 yes but of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.050
 shooting and that's not shielded 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050
 completely 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.510
 exact we have where where not above 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.960
 from behind 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.660
 sophie where by plane or as to saw in 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.550
 sofia mayor bazooka if not much more 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.740
 up is much higher what 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.040
 we have someone in front of the map if there is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.050
 someone there is shooting me shit 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 but if I do not lose care I cover you 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.200
 with muscle during I have grenade launchers 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.200
 they just sent me 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.890
 to calculate they were looking for today put up 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.890
 the kid 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.489
 the car should carry it because it has 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.489
 sniper ostia 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.239
 Red Red 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.330
 but that does not have marks because I am 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.680
 seeing is provided that is far and 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.019
 I can not 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.209
 we need with the sniper is to that site 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:39.170
 put yourself in some elevated position you 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:39.170
 I'm going to see how he thinks 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.989
 inside the tlc 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.760
 they have killed they have killed attack with a 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.959
 frentazo we do not go as far 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.880
 possible here I have here we are 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.890
 locked up to fly but now they 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.280
 shoot come come come come come what 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.319
 I have traveled the whore 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.790
 if he hits us a blow with this 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.010
 they kill at 12 so that's why I'm going to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.230
 move, I'm going to do it but it's not running 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.150
 run up go up 1 2 and let's get out of here and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.040
 has what here we are fatal is worth uncle 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.450
 but we see that they look for the sniper 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.940
 you do not know where you can be 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.290
 I am looking at the map that we dump there 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.060
 up is perfect, this is 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.090
 we really have to climb edge to edge 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.710
 on the right josemi with the armored 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.810
 in front of 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.539
 and we take it in that faculty or because I 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.600
 I do not see it kind of its verb anymore there it is 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.810
 Now I'm going to put aside, now, yes, 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.009
 now I'm going to leave here that we 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.009
 we can cover the vale and we go down 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.819
 where are you picked them up when the 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.990
 another sniper that can take loyo and 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.660
 let's have our rifle 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.539
 sniper let's go to it 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.470
 can discover the radars yes I'm 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.960
 inside can kill me with the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.080
 sniper the armored does not climb 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.080
 best 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.599
 now yes now yes now it is worth it 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.660
 trap them the trap of the c4 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.410
 of the go a little bigger than you 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.410
 you can use the radar 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.680
 for what and who was contacts 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.050

 I think they are up there there is one in the 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.800

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.199
