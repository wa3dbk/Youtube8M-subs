and as long as they don't see you in the
middle<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.229> usually<00:01:31.439> never<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.130> because

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
middle which I usually never do because

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
middle which I usually never do because
they're<00:01:32.610> pre<00:01:32.820> occupied<00:01:33.329> coming<00:01:33.780> around<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
corner you can just pick them off after

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.109 
corner you can just pick them off after
they<00:01:36.540> run<00:01:36.750> around<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> michael<00:01:38.790> myers<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
really awesome and I really like this
map<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> fact<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.479> dark<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
map I like the fact that it's dark and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
map I like the fact that it's dark and
gloomy<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.799> scary<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.640> mean<00:01:44.880> yeah

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
gloomy but it's not scary I mean yeah

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
gloomy but it's not scary I mean yeah
the<00:01:45.299> artwork<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> details<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the artwork or the details of it is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
the artwork or the details of it is
pretty<00:01:47.340> cool<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.600> 360<00:01:49.140> obviously

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
pretty cool not on the 360 obviously

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.350 
pretty cool not on the 360 obviously
because<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> looks<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.310> crap<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.149> guess

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
because it looks like crap but I guess

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.760 
because it looks like crap but I guess
it<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.600> look<00:01:51.720> much<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:52.110> than<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> xbox

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it would look much better than the xbox

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.569 
it would look much better than the xbox
one<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.280> ps4<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:54.149> PC<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.649> ever<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:56.070> pc

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
one or the ps4 or PC if they ever got pc

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.090 
one or the ps4 or PC if they ever got pc
working<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> though<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.710> a

working I really like it though it's a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
working I really like it though it's a
fun<00:01:59.310> map<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> music<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.810> michael

building<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.159> seems<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.879> lot<00:03:05.909> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
building but it seems like a lot of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.610 
building but it seems like a lot of
people<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:06.389> end<00:03:06.689> up<00:03:06.810> back<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.290> building

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
people just end up back in this building

so either you take the building or the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.000 
so either you take the building or the
enemy's<00:03:09.450> gonna<00:03:09.629> take<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.989> building<00:03:10.319> at<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
enemy's gonna take the building at the

enemy's gonna take the building at the
enemy<00:03:11.129> takes<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.579> boating<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.939> then<00:03:12.030> you're

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
enemy takes to boating and then you're

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.970
