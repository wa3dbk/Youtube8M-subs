going to last forever but there seems to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to last forever but there seems to
be<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.970> kind<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.690> life<00:02:23.020> cycle<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.560> them<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
be a kind of a life cycle to them and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.790 
be a kind of a life cycle to them and
that<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.700> peak<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.780> they<00:02:26.020> do<00:02:26.440> for

that they do peak and that they do for

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
that they do peak and that they do for
various<00:02:27.280> reasons<00:02:27.820> collapse<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:31.120> very
