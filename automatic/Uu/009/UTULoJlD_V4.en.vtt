hard<00:02:14.190> news<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> she's<00:02:16.709> like<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.270> Nona<00:02:18.270> knows<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
hard news and she's like a Nona knows so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.890 
hard news and she's like a Nona knows so
it<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.350> second<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.820> try<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.240> get

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it can be second but if we try to get

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930 
it can be second but if we try to get
through<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.470> membrane<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.580> know<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
through this membrane of you know and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
through this membrane of you know and
then<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.630> works<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.260> say<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.890> want<00:02:26.010> to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
then if it works and you say you want to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.920 
then if it works and you say you want to
go<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.190> sometime<00:02:26.480> sometimes<00:02:27.480> she'll<00:02:27.690> say<00:02:27.900> yes

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
go out sometime sometimes she'll say yes

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.920 
go out sometime sometimes she'll say yes
and<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:28.890> she<00:02:29.130> says<00:02:29.400> yes<00:02:29.459> that's<00:02:30.120> her<00:02:30.480> courage

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
and if she says yes that's her courage

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.600 
and if she says yes that's her courage
and<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.350> courage<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.860> takes<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> woman<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and the courage it takes for a woman to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.300 
and the courage it takes for a woman to
say<00:02:32.850> yes<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.330> beyond<00:02:34.019> anything<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:35.010> imagine

a woman saying yes to a date with a man

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.210 
a woman saying yes to a date with a man
is<00:02:38.160> literally<00:02:39.120> insane<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.940> ill-advised<00:02:41.940> and
