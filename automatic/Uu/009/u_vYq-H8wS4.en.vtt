00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
okay I want to stop this is being able

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.300 
okay I want to stop this is being able
to<00:02:32.840> understand<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.070> good

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to understand that this is not a good

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.250 
to understand that this is not a good
thing<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> not<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> beautiful<00:02:35.870> thing<00:02:36.019> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
thing this is not a beautiful thing so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.440 
thing this is not a beautiful thing so
we<00:02:36.709> build<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.159> sensitivity<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.060> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
we build that sensitivity and that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.420 
we build that sensitivity and that
sensitivity<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.200> built<00:02:39.440> through<00:02:39.680> two<00:02:39.920> ways

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
sensitivity is built through two ways

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
sensitivity is built through two ways
the<00:02:40.790> first<00:02:41.060> way<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.570> built<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.020> through

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the first way that it's built is through

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.950 
the first way that it's built is through
knowledge<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> person<00:02:44.120> gets<00:02:44.510> knowledge

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
knowledge that the person gets knowledge

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.390 
knowledge that the person gets knowledge
they<00:02:45.110> understand<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.800> did<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> prophet

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
they understand what did the prophet

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.920

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
time fill in the gaps of how we

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the ability to understand the world in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.370 
the ability to understand the world in
light<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.970> those<00:02:59.150> guidances<00:02:59.690> from<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.050> Quran

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
light of those guidances from the Quran

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.440 
light of those guidances from the Quran
and<00:03:00.560> from<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> simnet<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.970> second<00:03:02.330> thing

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
and from the simnet the second thing

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.550 
and from the simnet the second thing
that<00:03:02.570> we<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.840> do<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.260> build<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that we have to do to build the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.010 
that we have to do to build the
sensitivity<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.730> engage<00:03:05.570> in<00:03:05.780> our<00:03:05.900> own

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
sensitivity is to engage in our own

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.440 
sensitivity is to engage in our own
spiritual<00:03:06.470> development<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.240> one

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
spiritual development because it's one

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.970 
spiritual development because it's one
thing<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.440> understand

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
thing to know and to understand

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.950 
thing to know and to understand
intellectually<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:11.300> it's<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.510> completely

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
intellectually but it's a completely

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.360 
intellectually but it's a completely
different<00:03:12.110> thing<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.620> able<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.860> act<00:03:13.100> upon

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
different thing to be able to act upon

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.430 
different thing to be able to act upon
it<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.090> ability<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.540> act<00:03:14.810> upon<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.320> is

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
it and the ability to act upon it is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.590 
it and the ability to act upon it is
only<00:03:15.980> acquired<00:03:16.550> through<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.120> spiritual

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
only acquired through that spiritual

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.630 
only acquired through that spiritual
development<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.740> first<00:03:18.980> major<00:03:19.250> theme

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
development so the first major theme

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
development so the first major theme
from<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.000> hadith<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.720> sensitivity<00:03:21.110> okay

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
from the hadith is the sensitivity okay

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.320 
from the hadith is the sensitivity okay
I<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.459> something<00:03:22.850> evil

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the second thing about it is that the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.199 
the second thing about it is that the
Prophet<00:03:28.250> sallallaahu<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.790> they<00:03:28.910> will<00:03:29.030> send

is the question when we say by that by

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.220 
is the question when we say by that by

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.590 
the hand or by the tongue or by the
heart<00:04:03.590> why<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.280> said<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.700> sometimes<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.420> is

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
heart why I said that sometimes this is

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.150 
heart why I said that sometimes this is
misunderstood<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.380> missile<00:04:06.650> IED<00:04:06.830> is<00:04:07.040> that

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
misunderstood and missile IED is that

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.650 
misunderstood and missile IED is that
people<00:04:07.430> will<00:04:07.519> immediately<00:04:07.790> go<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.450> hand

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
objective that what came out of it is

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.550 
objective that what came out of it is
the<00:04:37.910> opposite<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.140> change<00:04:39.380> did

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
the opposite of that so the change did

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.860 
the opposite of that so the change did
not<00:04:39.620> exactly<00:04:40.100> occur<00:04:40.460> so<00:04:41.120> many<00:04:41.330> people<00:04:41.660> get

this<00:04:41.990> wrong<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.500> they<00:04:43.160> think<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.520> they<00:04:43.820> have

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
this wrong and they think that they have

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.610 
this wrong and they think that they have
to<00:04:44.120> change<00:04:44.300> by<00:04:44.510> hand<00:04:44.780> or<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:44.990> have<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.169> change<00:04:45.260> by

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
you were supposed to do so it's a really

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.559 
you were supposed to do so it's a really
a<00:05:31.189> positive<00:05:31.459> change<00:05:31.909> that's<00:05:32.089> the<00:05:32.180> second

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
a positive change that's the second

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.420 
a positive change that's the second
theme<00:05:32.749> the<00:05:33.349> third<00:05:33.589> theme<00:05:33.889> that's<00:05:34.189> really

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
theme the third theme that's really

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.879 
theme the third theme that's really
important<00:05:34.909> here<00:05:35.059> is<00:05:35.119> that<00:05:35.270> we<00:05:35.719> always<00:05:36.349> remain

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
important here is that we always remain

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.820 
important here is that we always remain
internally<00:05:37.669> with<00:05:38.240> what<00:05:38.689> we<00:05:38.839> feel<00:05:39.169> about<00:05:39.589> that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
internally with what we feel about that

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.029 
internally with what we feel about that
negative<00:05:40.309> thing<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:41.499> sometimes<00:05:42.499> we<00:05:42.740> get<00:05:42.860> into

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
negative thing so sometimes we get into

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.679 
negative thing so sometimes we get into
a<00:05:43.159> situation<00:05:43.219> for<00:05:43.969> example<00:05:44.059> and<00:05:44.449> this<00:05:44.509> is

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689 
a situation for example and this is

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.089 
a situation for example and this is
really<00:05:44.930> important<00:05:45.379> is<00:05:45.469> that<00:05:45.499> we<00:05:45.740> have<00:05:45.770> to

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
really important is that we have to

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.350 
really important is that we have to
ground<00:05:46.279> ourselves<00:05:46.520> always<00:05:47.180> in<00:05:47.300> our

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
ground ourselves always in our

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.149 
ground ourselves always in our
principles<00:05:47.930> even<00:05:48.050> if<00:05:48.409> we're<00:05:48.589> not<00:05:48.619> able<00:05:48.889> to

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
principles even if we're not able to

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.760 
principles even if we're not able to
make<00:05:49.339> them<00:05:49.520> exist<00:05:49.819> in<00:05:50.029> the<00:05:50.119> world<00:05:50.300> around<00:05:50.539> us

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
make them exist in the world around us

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.510 
make them exist in the world around us
internally<00:05:51.770> they<00:05:51.889> have<00:05:52.039> to<00:05:52.159> still<00:05:52.369> exist

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
internally they have to still exist

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.549 
internally they have to still exist
inside<00:05:52.999> our<00:05:53.149> hearts<00:05:53.389> so<00:05:53.990> we<00:05:54.020> look<00:05:54.319> at<00:05:54.469> the

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.559 
inside our hearts so we look at the

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.859 
inside our hearts so we look at the
thing<00:05:54.740> we<00:05:54.979> don't<00:05:55.129> like<00:05:55.339> it<00:05:55.580> we<00:05:56.509> can't<00:05:56.779> do

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:56.869 
thing we don't like it we can't do

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.529 
thing we don't like it we can't do
anything<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.349> change<00:05:57.529> it<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.759> does<00:05:59.059> not<00:05:59.089> mean

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
anything to change it that does not mean

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.869 
anything to change it that does not mean
that<00:05:59.569> you<00:05:59.870> stop<00:06:00.199> disliking<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.159> and<00:06:01.309> this<00:06:01.759> is

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
that you stop disliking it and this is

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.339 
that you stop disliking it and this is
the<00:06:02.029> third<00:06:02.180> point<00:06:02.419> that<00:06:02.539> for<00:06:02.839> the<00:06:02.930> third<00:06:03.110> theme

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
the third point that for the third theme

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.959 
the third point that for the third theme
that's<00:06:03.589> really<00:06:03.949> really<00:06:04.129> important<00:06:04.699> here<00:06:04.849> is

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
that's really really important here is

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.790 
that's really really important here is
that<00:06:05.449> even<00:06:05.719> if<00:06:05.839> you<00:06:05.930> can't<00:06:06.139> change<00:06:06.259> it<00:06:06.439> by<00:06:06.529> hand

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
that even if you can't change it by hand

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.279 
that even if you can't change it by hand
or<00:06:07.009> by<00:06:07.339> tongue<00:06:07.909> you<00:06:08.419> still<00:06:08.719> in<00:06:08.930> your<00:06:08.959> heart

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
or by tongue you still in your heart

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.589 
or by tongue you still in your heart
dislike<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.099> that<00:06:10.580> dislike<00:06:11.029> in<00:06:11.269> the<00:06:11.419> heart

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
dislike it and that dislike in the heart

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.480 
dislike it and that dislike in the heart
is<00:06:11.749> very<00:06:11.839> very<00:06:12.319> important<00:06:12.830> for<00:06:12.979> how<00:06:13.129> you<00:06:13.189> look

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
is very very important for how you look

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.549 
is very very important for how you look
at<00:06:13.639> the<00:06:13.759> world<00:06:13.969> and<00:06:14.180> how<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.749> analyze<00:06:15.409> the

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:15.559 
at the world and how you analyze the

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:16.570 
at the world and how you analyze the
world<00:06:15.769> and<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.039> things<00:06:16.249> that<00:06:16.339> go<00:06:16.430> along

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
world and the things that go along

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.119 
world and the things that go along
around<00:06:17.269> us<00:06:17.479> so<00:06:17.990> we<00:06:18.139> have<00:06:18.319> to<00:06:18.349> always<00:06:18.589> maintain

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
around us so we have to always maintain

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.889 
around us so we have to always maintain
that<00:06:19.159> and<00:06:19.459> keep<00:06:19.610> hold<00:06:19.819> of<00:06:19.939> that<00:06:20.089> and<00:06:20.300> remind

that and keep hold of that and remind
ourselves<00:06:21.019> that<00:06:21.349> just<00:06:21.620> because<00:06:21.889> you<00:06:22.009> can't

are<00:06:27.709> the<00:06:27.860> three<00:06:28.129> major<00:06:28.309> themes<00:06:28.699> to<00:06:29.269> take<00:06:29.449> from

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
are the three major themes to take from

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.239 
are the three major themes to take from
this<00:06:29.749> hadith<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.289> first<00:06:30.529> one<00:06:30.709> is<00:06:30.889> this<00:06:31.039> issue

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:31.249 
this hadith the first one is this issue

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.009 
this hadith the first one is this issue
of<00:06:31.399> sensitivity<00:06:32.149> building<00:06:32.539> a<00:06:32.599> sensitivity

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:33.019 
of sensitivity building a sensitivity

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:34.749 
of sensitivity building a sensitivity
for<00:06:33.259> what<00:06:33.559> is<00:06:33.680> evil<00:06:34.039> and<00:06:34.129> what<00:06:34.219> is<00:06:34.339> good<00:06:34.459> what

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
for what is evil and what is good what

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.850 
for what is evil and what is good what
is<00:06:34.819> beautiful<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:35.389> what<00:06:35.479> is<00:06:35.629> ugly<00:06:35.809> the<00:06:36.499> second

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
is beautiful and what is ugly the second

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.350 
is beautiful and what is ugly the second
is<00:06:36.949> to<00:06:36.979> engage<00:06:37.430> in<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.669> positive<00:06:38.149> constructive

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
is to engage in a positive constructive
