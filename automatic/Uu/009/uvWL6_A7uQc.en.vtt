Burgundy since the 12th century and this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.529 
Burgundy since the 12th century and this

wine<00:00:45.750> spectrum<00:00:46.320> even<00:00:46.620> looking<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.399> the

glass<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> translucency

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
glass we can see it has a translucency

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040 
glass we can see it has a translucency
to<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> grape<00:00:51.780> has

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to it that is because the grape has

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
to it that is because the grape has
relatively<00:00:52.620> thin<00:00:53.039> skins<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.090> it's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
relatively thin skins and so it's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
relatively thin skins and so it's
delivery<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.079> color<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.710> flavor<00:00:55.949> intensity

delivery of color and flavor intensity

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
delivery of color and flavor intensity
to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> wine<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> lighter<00:00:57.989> end<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> the
