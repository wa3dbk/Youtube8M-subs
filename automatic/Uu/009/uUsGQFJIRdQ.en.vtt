00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.820
 Hello everyone today is another small 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.840
 topic is recovery recovery 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.790
 thread means I use these 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 in sets 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:34.190
 I think that this is the most 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 optimal 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.230
 rome ear surgery while recovering 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 threading then there is nothing better just not 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.660
 come up I think what you all saw on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.750
 such a thing 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 that is, is done very simply cut 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 some holes first for example 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's save 6 we hurt before being cut 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.040
 a little more hole is drilled 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.059
 the drill bit is not cut here 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.500
 broken thread 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.460
 this head and mahi xp-600 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 here it is and we will now 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420
 restore 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 was the beginning hour we take and drill out 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:27.319
 set 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:29.490
 ream hole there is contact 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:34.770
 I feel a little uncomfortable with one hand 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.940
 I hold the camera 2 I drill and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.940
 proper riza im carving 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:08.740
 so all the thread we drove chic then us 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.580
 now we take a special mandrel and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:18.640
 wrapped on it our vertige he has 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.330
 such a special antenna here we are 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.530
 we can her 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.010
 wrap it up after wrapping this 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.080
 mustache just breaks off and everything is so 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 now turn our screw 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.090
 neatly screw it to the hut 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.790
 twist flush that last 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.510
 whip we went well and not 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.510
 popped up 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:03:00.710
 unscrew this is our thread is now and here 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:06.410
 she is beautiful all the hole is set 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:11.820
 so the final touch is breaking the burr 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:15.090
 just show you a new prominent sticks out yeah 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.870
 here is a serif with which we 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.540
 we twist just insert the mandrel and I 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:28.010
 even his arm broke cheat all now 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.780
 hence it canâ€™t be turned out anymore 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.210
 the most competent of all the options and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.880
 enjoy on the magic dream have life 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.970
 nuance find myself the first time I wanted 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.430
 fool everyone 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.390
 took bought only the stars of the show there 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.520
 understandable to all I have everything turned out 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:53.070
 such bjaka what means if you cut 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.350
 Our usual tick M7 then bolt M6 there 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.890
 just doesn't climb i mean he doesn't 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.410
 screwed tight very tight thread 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.900
 It turns out if you take a cut m8 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.150
 screw it hard then it turns out 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.760
 very weak that is, the chip is all here 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.210
 this place it has seven threads 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.340
 half so fool no one 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.680
 get a set at once and then 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.460
 you will buy these separately 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.330
 screw 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:24.870
 when are you over so our 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.290
 set here we have screwed pro 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.180
 the length 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.590
 already gone all over I'm the last 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.930
 Now I have returned it in the set of swords 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.340
 Amendment for breaking it is not me mustache 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.660
 with which 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.840
 the screw is twisted and the point is right 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.580
 threaded which helps wrap it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.710
 hardness well, still there is such a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.270
 instruction 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.850
 paper which is clearly there all 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.390
 It shows how everything is done very much. 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.400
 clear beautiful very nice kit 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.389
 this is a kit 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:04.520
 we sat down coil here they are perfect 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:09.320
 different are any shorter what I took 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:13.370
 so I have 6 8 10 candle candles 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:18.789
 also very well repaired than there is 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:22.100
 dozhetochki under small candles 12 14 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.970
 another favor I am such a kit 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.970
 bear ql 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.229
 Well, to be honest 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.820
 Madeleine Germany 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.090
 but sibilla is there 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.110
 the only thing plus is very 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.520
 interesting sword after you show it 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.110
 Sword 2 Landing 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.110
 i.e. he first screwed in 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.880
 old thread and then cut new 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.919
 of course it's very comfortable when you 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.380
 repairing a candle hole that is 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.510
 you mechik exactly on the old thread 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.760
 at least a little bit how would he direction 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.520
 set correctly and you and turn out 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.050
 start cutting but here but 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.180
 bundled very very nasty system 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.409
 wrapping i mean i every time when 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.449
 but doing this set of threads 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.409
 I use constantly because this one 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.550
 halabuda made for wrapping 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.430
 for some reason I have to wrap it up 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.110
 it never works like this 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:33.500
 She wears very uncomfortable that is she 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.810
 see that she's hanging out here she 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.720
 dangles she twists very badly 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.930
 that is, here is a system like k or i 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.909
 I think that the most optimal is very 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.500
 conveniently quickly everything is well wrapped 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:50.260
 that is probably this futorka and 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.970
 thread 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.389
 it is much correct and twists 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.340
 much easier than that 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.550
 by methods 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:05.040
 it is not clear how 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:08.110
 wrapped kai here I do not advise 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.990
 only because of the good tap all 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.290
 I like the best 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.690
 more great and all the best of luck to you 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:23.290
 repair your equipment 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.960
 beautifully correct and neat and she 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:33.090
 will serve you faithfully as 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.090
 I still see you soon
