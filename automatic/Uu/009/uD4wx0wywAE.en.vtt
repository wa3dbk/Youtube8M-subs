00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.960
 it picked me up easy for every day 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 in the first option we will start 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 taking a lock on one side and with a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.079
 small rubber we will make a pigtail 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.090
 Now we open our hair and we pass the 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.460
 pigtail inside and let's do what 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.780
 same on the other side we take a lock 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.090
 with a small rubber we make a pigtail 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.430
 We opened our hair and we went through 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.570
 inside we can take them back with two 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.570
 small clamps 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.360
 put them back with a bigger pint 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.590
 or else tie them with a ponytail 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 and take a lock and cover the rubber 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.620
 We hold the strand with a hairpin and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.620
 ready 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.359
 in the second option we are going to take two 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.359
 long strands from the sides 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.759
 we cross them we pass one over 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:30.759
 making a knot and let's make a loop 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.219
 we surround and we take them out inside 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.619
 We tighten and place a fork in 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.619
 diagonal below and ready 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.590
 in this option we are going to take the part of 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.369
 above the hair and we will make a pigtail 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.490
 we take a lock from one side of the other 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.579
 we cross them and we pass one above 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.880
 making a knot we add hair to the 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.299
 tufts on one side and the other and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.989
 again we crossed them we passed one by 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.450
 up we press and make another knot 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.920
 we tie the two strands we tie 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 with a small rubber 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.400
 and ready
