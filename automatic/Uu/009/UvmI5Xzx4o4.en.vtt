00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
 Hi, how are you, I'm Mariana and in this 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.200
 I bring you the December group 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.209
 and warm January the books I read 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.150
 in December the books that possibly 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.509
 go read in January and without further 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.509
 at once 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.190
 the first book I read in December was 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.040
 by lisa mcmann which is the last book of 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.369
 the trilogy the hunter of dreams and 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.830
 unfortunately I just liked it, I think 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 I expected more of these books and I just 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.230
 I gave three of five stars after I read 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 prodigy of lou lou and the 10 -five 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.559
 because I really liked the plot to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.390
 Although the book was very slow and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.220
 after the promise of blood of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 Eurovision mit which is the fourth book of 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.490
 the saga the vampire academy and that book 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 it was sensational 10 5 and 5 stars to 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.990
 Although it was too slow 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 I really liked the plot after I read the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.200
 third book by percy jackson that is the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.720
 curse of the titan and obviously they know 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.110
 that I love Percy Jackson's books like this 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.840
 I gave him 55 stars because despite 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.759
 all the adventures of all the drama to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 Despite the absence of a person I 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.799
 really liked the book was very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 funny and anwar rick riordan also 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.390
 I read sad dark heart to this book 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.460
 I gave him four out of five stars 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.220
 I think they do not see the perfect world 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.010
 for this book already almost last you and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.020
 a rebel taher masri who is the second 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.640
 The first book is juliette's skin 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.090
 to this book he gave five five 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 stars 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.830
 I liked it too it 's amazing this 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.000
 book and many films and well they were 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.890
 all the books that I read in the month of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 December now we are going to the possible 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.150
 books that I will read in the month of January 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.150
 but since we are already in the middle of January 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.600
 I'll show that reading books 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.820
 currently that I'm possibly going to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 finish in January to some I hope so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.899

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.850
 of birth of this book of 55 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.820
 stars will not go into more details 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.040
 why 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 because I better say it in the group of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.810
 January by just saying that it is a dystopia 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.640
 too original and I definitely liked it 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.290
 quite and I am also reading throne 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.720

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.520
 finish and I'm enjoying enough 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 suddenly like it gets a little loose or 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.480
 I got fed up a little bit more likely 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.010
