get<00:04:41.229> along<00:04:41.410> but<00:04:41.470> uh<00:04:41.800> apparently<00:04:42.520> there's<00:04:43.000> a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
get along but uh apparently there's a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.180 
get along but uh apparently there's a
lot<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.240> mixing<00:04:43.840> going<00:04:44.020> on<00:04:44.289> with<00:04:44.500> those<00:04:44.650> two<00:04:44.710> so

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
lot of mixing going on with those two so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.999 
lot of mixing going on with those two so
here<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.120> am

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.609 

I<00:04:51.099> thought<00:04:51.909> about<00:04:52.180> how<00:04:52.389> we<00:04:52.839> need<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.139> focus<00:04:53.319> on

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
I thought about how we need to focus on

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:55.890 
I thought about how we need to focus on
our<00:04:53.740> youth<00:04:53.949> and<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:55.210> they're<00:04:55.330> doing<00:04:55.569> outside

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
our youth and what they're doing outside

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.179 
our youth and what they're doing outside
is<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.259> know<00:04:56.349> they're<00:04:56.529> really<00:04:56.710> focusing<00:04:57.099> on

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
is you know they're really focusing on

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.399 
is you know they're really focusing on
our<00:04:57.309> youth<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.639> you<00:04:58.150> know<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.330> plant<00:04:59.289> the

seeds and then you nurture the seats

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.279 
seeds and then you nurture the seats
from<00:05:01.029> there<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.389> lot<00:05:01.689> of<00:05:01.779> times<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.050> get<00:05:02.169> guys
