00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
everyone could have heard it I wanted to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.870 
everyone could have heard it I wanted to
keep<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> tradition<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.960> how<00:01:54.950> much<00:01:55.189> this<00:01:55.429> this

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
keep the tradition of how much this this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.520 
keep the tradition of how much this this
meant<00:01:56.149> this<00:01:56.299> commitment<00:01:56.719> of<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.109> two<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.380> us

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
meant this commitment of the two of us

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.529 
meant this commitment of the two of us
to<00:01:57.770> each<00:01:57.920> other<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.060> why<00:01:59.210> we<00:01:59.390> wrote

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
to each other and that is why we wrote

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.510 
to each other and that is why we wrote
our<00:01:59.600> own<00:01:59.719> vows<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.350> why<00:02:00.950> we're<00:02:01.130> supposed<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
our own vows well why we're supposed to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.850 
our own vows well why we're supposed to
write<00:02:01.670> our<00:02:01.820> own<00:02:01.850> house

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.200 

I<00:02:07.860> don't<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.880> excuse<00:02:09.179> for

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
I don't know if I have a good excuse for

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.200 
I don't know if I have a good excuse for
that<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.020> worked<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:11.150> part<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
that one but it all worked out part of

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.370 
that one but it all worked out part of
the<00:02:12.300> reason<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.630> really<00:02:12.870> hard<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> hear<00:02:13.320> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the reason it was really hard to hear it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
the reason it was really hard to hear it
was<00:02:13.470> because<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.370> windy<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.630> mean<00:02:15.870> my

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
was because it was so windy I mean my

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.890 
was because it was so windy I mean my
veil<00:02:16.320> was<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:17.070> would<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:17.970> six<00:02:18.360> feet<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> air

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
veil was I would be six feet in the air

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900 
veil was I would be six feet in the air
if<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.590> had<00:02:19.710> gone<00:02:19.740> right<00:02:20.100> into<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.460> bay<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
if that had gone right into the bay I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
if that had gone right into the bay I
think<00:02:21.360> my<00:02:21.540> poor<00:02:21.810> aunt<00:02:21.990> who<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.290> borrowed<00:02:22.650> it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
think my poor aunt who I borrowed it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.650 
think my poor aunt who I borrowed it
from<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.070> would<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.310> been<00:02:23.460> not<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.240> happy<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
from it would have been not as happy a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.380 
from it would have been not as happy a
day<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.050> her<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.640> me<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.210> had<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
day for her as it was for me we had a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.850 
day for her as it was for me we had a
very<00:02:27.480> nice<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:30.320> neglect<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.440> lasts<00:02:31.740> longer

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
very nice this neglect it lasts longer

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.550 
very nice this neglect it lasts longer
then<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:33.030> cut<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.330> short<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:34.020> didn't<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.380> many

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
then that cut it short we didn't do many

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.070 
then that cut it short we didn't do many
traditional<00:02:35.780> activities<00:02:36.780> during<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
