00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
31 years now it looks good I actually uh
looks<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> tracks<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.350> flow<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

it<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> sand<00:00:59.879> looks<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.440> gonna

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it the sand looks pretty like it's gonna

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
it the sand looks pretty like it's gonna
be<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:02.039> deep<00:01:02.309> obviously<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.149> wrong<00:01:03.359> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
be pretty deep obviously it wrong so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.110 
be pretty deep obviously it wrong so
it'd<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.559> interesting

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
pretty deep it it's really cool actually

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.930 
pretty deep it it's really cool actually
because<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:30.170> grew<00:01:31.070> up<00:01:31.130> as<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> kid<00:01:31.550> riding<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.850> lot

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
because I grew up as a kid riding a lot

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.399 
because I grew up as a kid riding a lot
of<00:01:32.000> sand<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:32.899> somewhat<00:01:33.229> similar

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
of sand in it and it's somewhat similar

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.889 
of sand in it and it's somewhat similar
to<00:01:33.619> where<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.130> grew<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.430> at<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.600> doesn't

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
to where I grew up at and it doesn't

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.380 
to where I grew up at and it doesn't
have<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.049> hard<00:01:36.259> base<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.190> you're<00:01:37.610> always<00:01:37.820> you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390

know<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.840> tracks<00:01:39.350> getting<00:01:39.649> rougher

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
know the tracks getting rougher

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.889 
know the tracks getting rougher
continually<00:01:40.820> every<00:01:41.090> lap<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.570> can<00:01:41.720> notice

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
continually every lap and you can notice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.590 
continually every lap and you can notice
it<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:43.280> fun<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:43.729> know<00:01:43.759> sand<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.300> always
