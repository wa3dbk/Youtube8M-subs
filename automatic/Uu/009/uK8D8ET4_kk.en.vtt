00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.999
 ah 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.760
 hello great friends from the world of 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.390
 collecting here we start another video 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.850
 reverse of the universe of 'dragon ball' 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.800
 Here I bring you a video game that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.309
 the dragon ball z 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.230
 ultimate tenkaichi from playstation3 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.790
 the edition collector's edition 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.420
 as you can see here we can 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.130
 the design of the box is quite good 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.580
 simply what the title of the game 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.650
 here we have our character the goku 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.900
 on the side what is the content 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:08.450
 video game a figure contained this set 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.450
 behind a bit of the video game 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 and on the other side 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.910
 we went to the inside of the box 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.159
 we already have content here outside of 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.170
 box in this case the figure that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.770
 contained was someone with the suit of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 they call 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.460
 The truth is that the design is also very 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 good 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.140
 now you can see a little more in 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.360
 close-up more closely the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.050
 instructions of what is the video game 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 It was a little thick and they came outside 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.450
 the box of the video game 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.020
 and the video game 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.020
 you can see 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.380
 it did not contain any lc or anything 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.340
 downloadable was simply 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 and then to dry 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.319
 seen 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.129
 and the only special content was this 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.860
 figure in which to appreciate to 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.090
 constant moment did not seem very 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.520
 reasonable 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.080
 but good 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:30.380
 things apart the passable video game 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.210
 as always I have not mentioned it in others 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.520
 videos 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.830
 because I have not had the possibility 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.950
 because he had not talked about video games 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.670
 but I think it's one of the best until 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.000
 moment is still the dragon ball z 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.330
 Budokai Tenkaichi 3 the play 2 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.740
 technical character and so on 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.630
 and this I only hope that in a next 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.870
 video game come the option to power 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.220
 achieve the characteristics of that 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.230
 Play 2 system that brought out the good 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.800
 they aside we went to see the figures 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.820
 close up closeup 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.820
 what do you think 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.430
 and nothing here here we go again reverse of the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.890
 universe of 'dragon ball' 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.980
