00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.639
 me 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.100
 Are we to introduce this time is the water wheel was released in October 2014 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.660
 Lexus rc this is rc 300 hf sports 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:35.730
 Lexus has previously been a retractable roof with isc or sc 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.579
 Well there was a coupe model, but a 2 door coupe came out anew at this timing 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.469
 Why is it 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.359
 Perhaps one of the first things to consider is that premium brands need a coupe 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.289
 I think there is such an idea 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:50.920
 Mercedes-Benz's e-class coupe goes with rivals 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:55.510
 bmw 4 series coupe woody a file 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 For these reasons , European premium brands are usually of this size 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.399
 Have a coupe 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.940
 Masu still in order to say that it is a premium brand proudly to the world as a Lexus 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:09.140
 I think the coupe's and such a place there was one Nehito necessary 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.439
 And another spindle grille has been adopted since gs 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 None of the Lexus models have evolved dramatically 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:21.060
 Express it in particular in terms of design and running 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.509
 Above is a sedan or suv but it is still a symbolic model coupe 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.829
 I think that it might have been in the background if necessary 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 I'm not going to you can not afford to parentheses bad if the coupe also not a bad run 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.630
 So the compilation of what Lexus has ever done 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 I like if is decisive 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.039
 Keeping it cool and running coupe is also necessary for the current Lexus 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.579
 I think there is such a background too 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:48.390
 There are c 300 h to introduce this time in the lineup 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.929
 A hybrid of a 2.5-liter gasoline engine and an electric motor 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.620
 model 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:58.360
 And there are 35 Marcos loaded with a 3.5-liter v- type rocket. 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:01.480
 There are 2 types available, so I would like to go into details soon . 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 It is still this design to capture the eyes first 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:10.660
 The spindle grill has become increasingly bold, but this light and so on for details too 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.010
 There is a highlight, but after all this rc No.1 is the whole Forno Neemama highlight and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.640
 I think I should say 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.640
 Previous husband and winter until 1840 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.840
 It sounds like is to until the show powerfully it the appearance that run wide stance has passed through the spine Innovation coach 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.730
 line with'll another run indeed a place called'll run not just elegant 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 Proportions that appeal to the whole body 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.160
 It is such a design that is finished as a very carnivorous coupe as Lexus 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.650
 I think 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.920
 You are familiar with is the power train Lexus 2.5-liter in-line four-cylinder engine and an electric 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.920
 A hybrid system combining motors is installed 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.850
 The maximum output of the system is 220 horsepower 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 The fuel consumption is 23 points 2 km in jc 08 mode 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.030
 This is a great weapon because there is no hybrid coupe for European rivals 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.510
 I guess I guess 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.209
 It is an interior 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.720
 It is an interior of the impression according to the context grammar of recent Lexus Well the quality is also high 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:08.010
 I think that the design is also not bad because there is a personality 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:13.170
 And the driving position is a sedan type too, and the steering stands properly 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.500
 Stomach his seated position there in front even after all I say is low also recently Lexus 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.430
 Common to all 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.150
 Position to be the feeling that'll be driving a sporty sound is not able properly to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.330
 Isn't it 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.830
 Well I think that it is all the more important because this coupe 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.630
 It is well remote touch or drive mode select as equipments and here 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.560
 Well comes with familiar things 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.490
 Well, there is a place that seems to be a little bigger screen if you say greed 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.810
 Well this is by operation with touch pad 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.880
 It seems like the latest sound mode is basically complete . 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:48.080
 Because this car is f sports, it is a movable meter that I have been using since lfa 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.610
 Includes sport-type seats with special sound stitching 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.140
 Certainly interesting or rather interesting just to see Well I have this stitch very elaborate 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.770
 There is 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.970
 It is a pair sheet . 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:07.220
 Say that is not you is it, but Well feet are jamming is to dilute sleep this seat back 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.660
 Somehow in the around the knee There is also a space c toes into the bottom of the front of the sound seat by 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.130
 Okay 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.850
 If the short distance when Well after all of the Well the way to keep the bag Kinki is usually because 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.840
 I think I can ride that kind of rear seat 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.560
 It is the luggage space Well times syntax really to is wide 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.030
 Well capacitively to about still can afford even if a large suitcase I also 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.820
 It's really full, but it's a hybrid, but a hybrid battery . 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.870
 It's all under the floor, as is is 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:42.880
 This Ganema's and after Mali and sheets I split mechanism has led to this per day also thanks 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:46.810
 It means that you can afford to pile up even bigger things 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.940
 What kind of run will a Lexus two-door coupe all-in- one look like? 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.940
 I would like to confirm it soon
