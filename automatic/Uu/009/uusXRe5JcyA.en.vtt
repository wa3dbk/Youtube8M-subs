00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
on it about 360 k to go so that's about

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
on it about 360 k to go so that's about
four<00:00:22.769> hours<00:00:22.920> um<00:00:23.330> which<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.960> very<00:00:24.990> fun

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
four hours um which is not very fun

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
four hours um which is not very fun

however<00:01:07.229> um<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.820> faster<00:01:09.119> ways<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
however um there are faster ways if you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
however um there are faster ways if you
want<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.100> XP<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.479> aren't<00:01:12.810> too

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
concerned that it's not going to be

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
concerned that it's not going to be
quite<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.820> AFK<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.659> method<00:01:15.960> before<00:01:16.110> i'm

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
quite as AFK as your method before i'm

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.570 
quite as AFK as your method before i'm
going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> show<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.830> exactly<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> need

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
for this method alright so first of all

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
for this method alright so first of all
you<00:01:20.220> want<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.700> started<00:01:21.180> i'm<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you want to get started i'm not going to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
you want to get started i'm not going to
let<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.409> through<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> again<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
let go through all this again because it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.859 
let go through all this again because it
takes<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.119> while<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.450> set<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
takes a little while to get set up and

need to do this method is a lot of body

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
need to do this method is a lot of body
rooms<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> couple<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:41.000> death<00:01:42.000> and

rooms in just a couple on death and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
rooms in just a couple on death and
blood<00:01:42.390> runs<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> started<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.649> then

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
blood runs to get you started and then

blood runs to get you started and then
I'll<00:01:44.520> open<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> world<00:01:45.659> map<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
I'll open up the world map here and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.889 
I'll open up the world map here and
basically<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> spawn<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> runes

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
basically when you spawn in the runes

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
basically when you spawn in the runes
ban<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> high<00:01:49.530> level<00:01:49.770> entrance<00:01:50.130> you're

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
ban on the high level entrance you're

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
ban on the high level entrance you're
down<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.759> near<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> transportation<00:01:51.840> icon

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
down here near the transportation icon

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
down here near the transportation icon
and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.430> you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.970> do

and then what you're going to want to do

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.100 
and then what you're going to want to do
is<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.450> travel<00:01:54.840> straight<00:01:55.079> east<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:56.159> and

is just travel straight east right and
come<00:01:58.110> along<00:01:58.530> onto<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.369> large<00:01:59.670> island<00:02:00.119> around

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
come along onto this large island around

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
come along onto this large island around
my<00:02:00.659> were<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.079> mouse<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.320> pointing<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.979> then

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
my were my mouse is pointing and then

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.649 
my were my mouse is pointing and then
there's<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> string<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.329> five

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
there's going to be a string of five

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.620 
there's going to be a string of five
islands<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:05.159> all<00:02:05.549> these<00:02:05.759> islands<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
islands here on all these islands they

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
islands here on all these islands they
mostly<00:02:07.049> spawn<00:02:07.380> high<00:02:07.619> level<00:02:07.950> nodes<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.429> see

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
mostly spawn high level nodes I see

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
mostly spawn high level nodes I see
undead<00:02:09.090> souls<00:02:09.390> living<00:02:09.810> Souls<00:02:10.289> bloody<00:02:10.739> Souls

undead souls living Souls bloody Souls
constantly<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.180> time<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:12.810> there

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
constantly all the time it's there

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.060 
constantly all the time it's there
almost<00:02:13.660> always<00:02:14.050> at<00:02:14.320> least<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.950> those

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
almost always at least one of those

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.370 
almost always at least one of those
nodes<00:02:15.370> up<00:02:15.700> among<00:02:16.360> these<00:02:16.540> five<00:02:16.720> islands<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
nodes up among these five islands and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.320 
nodes up among these five islands and
quite<00:02:17.560> often<00:02:17.770> more<00:02:18.100> than<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.270> you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
quite often more than that and so you

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.850 
quite often more than that and so you
want<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.660> do<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.050> camp<00:02:20.470> these<00:02:20.650> five

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
want to do is just camp these five

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.830 
want to do is just camp these five
islands<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.640> transporters<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.330> between<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
islands the transporters in between the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360 
islands the transporters in between the
islands<00:02:23.230> only<00:02:23.350> take<00:02:23.770> blood<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.220> death

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
islands only take blood and death

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.620 
islands only take blood and death
friends<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.850> there's<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.060> couple<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.450> take

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
friends and there's a couple that take

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510 
friends and there's a couple that take
body<00:02:25.840> rooms<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:26.350> well<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:27.130> that's<00:02:27.310> why<00:02:27.460> you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
body rooms as well so that's why you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
body rooms as well so that's why you
need<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.820> body<00:02:27.970> rooms<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.020> need<00:02:29.170> to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
need the body rooms but all you need to

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
need the body rooms but all you need to
transport<00:02:29.560> between<00:02:29.920> these<00:02:30.160> islands<00:02:30.520> are

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
transport between these islands are

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.340 
transport between these islands are
blood<00:02:30.940> death<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.330> body<00:02:31.480> rings<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.870> get<00:02:32.020> tons

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
blood death and body rings you get tons

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.020 
blood death and body rings you get tons
of<00:02:32.560> blood<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.980> death<00:02:33.130> runs<00:02:33.370> from<00:02:33.550> siphoning

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
of blood and death runs from siphoning

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.760 
of blood and death runs from siphoning
the<00:02:34.090> nodes<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.960> all<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.350> really<00:02:35.380> need<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
the nodes so all you really need to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.860 
the nodes so all you really need to
worry<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.190> body<00:02:36.520> rooms<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.060> if<00:02:37.690> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
worry about is body rooms and if you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
worry about is body rooms and if you
just<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.350> along<00:02:38.560> these<00:02:38.740> five<00:02:38.950> islands<00:02:39.340> don't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
just go along these five islands don't

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.980 
just go along these five islands don't
worry<00:02:39.880> about<00:02:39.970> siphoning<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.600> creatures

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
worry about siphoning the creatures

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.840 
worry about siphoning the creatures
don't<00:02:41.230> camp<00:02:41.470> down<00:02:41.620> what<00:02:41.830> island<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.340> go

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
don't camp down what island just go

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.400 
don't camp down what island just go
between<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.210> islands<00:02:43.600> siphoning<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.110> nodes

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
between the islands siphoning the nodes

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.470 
between the islands siphoning the nodes
and<00:02:45.220> I'll<00:02:45.430> show<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.640> exactly<00:02:46.030> what<00:02:46.270> Five

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and I'll show you exactly what Five

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
and I'll show you exactly what Five
Islands<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.170> talking<00:02:47.560> about<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.010> the

Islands I'm talking about this is the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.610 
Islands I'm talking about this is the
middle<00:02:48.340> one<00:02:48.370> right<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:50.050> then<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> north

middle one right and then to the north

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.680 
middle one right and then to the north
there's<00:02:51.220> two<00:02:51.490> islands<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.570> go

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
there's two islands that you can go
