00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and it shows all we need in gta 5 and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.330
 as I'm seeing it has finally come out 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 jeta 5 remastered what you wanted to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.690
 that came out to prove all this that the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.059
 it's really cool but good 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 well I come to bring you what would be the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.969
 rain as I'm seeing that right now 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.440
 it's raining that pretty cool still 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 also but good what I come to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.580
 show you today would be the new submarine 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 It's called cracking but first of all 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.670
 by the way in the image as you are 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 seeing what I have in the background of what 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 would be the mobile because that image is put 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.609
 automatically when you have a crew 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 the crew that I have would be the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.730
 that I created the image of the clipper 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
 that by the way you have it in the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 description in case you want united for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.930
 to follow me then there you have it and good 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340
 as you have seen there would be crack 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.050
 that there you can buy what would be the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 new submarine and I'm going to ask you now 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.149
 same to pegasus to see where not what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.039
 would leave because thetic author of having where 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.600
 he does not leave it to know where I 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.949
 he thinks they were going to leave him on the beach 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.079
 but not now you are going to see that they would leave it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.360
 as here through the harbor for this 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 zone and good the video I have locked in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.600
 live what happens is that I have not given 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.579
 account and had what was the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 music of the motorbike and also then the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.480
 radio music of what it would be then 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.490
 the submarine 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.220
 I had to edit it and have to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 comment it right now because 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.690
 all that music because it is copyright 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 so I prefer not to upload it like that because 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.350
 for the music they can for anyone 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.760
 strike and you can take out such the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.980
 Expression behavior does not play 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.630
 online is in this case then as 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
 you are going to see now here it leaves us well what 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.230
 that would be the submarine and the truth that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.000
 it's really cool the truth that I have 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.130
 eager to be trying it and to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.510
 look pretty good what would be wrong 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.490
 and all this since there have to be 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.990
 many mysteries that we have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 put up here defeat them this time 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 and the truth that I already have enough desire 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.780
 to find any to climb the channel 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.370
 and that you see it and how are you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.290
 watching looks pretty good but if you 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.240
 we put in third person looks still 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 better since in first person then 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.260
 we are only seeing what in that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 moment we have opposite but in third 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.250
 person you're going to see face changed it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.080
 So you see what we have to the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.690
 sides and what we have then 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 practically in front and we're going to 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.140
 can see much better if we do not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.330
 we will be crashing all the time as 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.429
 I was doing in this case the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.929
 true that well look as I say I'm going to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.820
 be looking to see if I find something 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.470
 below the sea or anything in 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.150
 Any case if you are 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.100
 whatever, leave it to me for the comments 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 and I will also try to see if it 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
 find something to upload it so nothing 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.740
 I hope you liked to cali for 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 more subscribed tv you are not and see you 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.940
 in the next one until then
