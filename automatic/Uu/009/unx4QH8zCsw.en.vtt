people<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.730> do<00:01:43.940> this<00:01:51.280> yeah<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.310> mean<00:01:52.550> look<00:01:52.670> at

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
people to do this yeah I mean look at

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.430 
people to do this yeah I mean look at
g-strings<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:53.810> thought<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.260> was

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
g-strings and I thought that was

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.510 
g-strings and I thought that was
something<00:01:54.680> okay<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.270> buy<00:01:57.370> but<00:01:58.370> now

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
something okay but that you buy but now

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.480 
something okay but that you buy but now
you're<00:01:58.729> telling<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.360> people<00:01:59.630> are

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
particular a bot down there

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.760 
particular a bot down there
well<00:02:04.760> apparently<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.990> think<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.619> average

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
well apparently I think the average

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.030 
well apparently I think the average
person<00:02:07.340> spends<00:02:07.640> about<00:02:07.820> an<00:02:08.330> hour<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.780> week<00:02:12.040> doing

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
person spends about an hour a week doing
