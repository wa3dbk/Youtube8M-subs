00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:02.950
 Hello 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.440
 this small introduction to our 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.470
 video course on how to work with 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.170
 software 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.170
 camera document 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.570
 document camera as known 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.870
 this is a special class of devices 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.269
 intended 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.380
 to transfer real image pages 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.109
 percentage of textbooks or notebooks of illustrations 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.949
 drawn scheme 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.830
 three-dimensional objects 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.270
 need like any device 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.010
 display information on 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.090
 tv monitor 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.320
 weeks through the video projector but 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 big screen 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410
 now may 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.090
 show a few examples and then how 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.140
 used camcorder 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 in schools 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.650
 in front of you 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.070
 study of physics of a Moscow school 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.870
 here then one of the co-authors of examples 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.310
 camera application 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.300
 physics teachers and demonstrates 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 percent but before 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 Kovalenko 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.000
 self-employed students 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 or pilot one more example you need 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.640
 show price to students 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.370
 set of small items 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.250
 radio electronics 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.570
 you can put it in rows 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 can be through a video camera 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.570
 display on a board of a larger view 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.920
 and much easier to explain callas elephant 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 what is there in this picture 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.119
 biology room at the same school 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.740
 as you can see the workplace teacher 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 also equipped with a document camera 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.010
 what already 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 I apply here a document camera 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.719
 in one and then like this on this photo 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:17.539
 can 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.009
 see 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.349
 here it is 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.669
 subject to close 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.669
 fixed on microscopy 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.080
 this special adapter 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 which allows you to connect m 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.659
 microscopes 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.339
 directly 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.089
 camera document 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.559
 and using this adapter output 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.359
 on the big screen 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.170
 the next 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 on the image of a certain drug 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.369
 or for example 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.369
 demonstrate for discussion on 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.159
 big screen 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.159
 option 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.620
 st independent work student 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.310
 watching 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.809
 specific 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.999
 biological object of this 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 flower case 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:18.279
 sometimes 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.689
 we need to show the students 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.949
 some 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.379
 samples 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.489
 for exhibits which 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.129
 can not let go in rows 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.939
 so that m 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.819
 do no damage 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.679
 to the samples here in this case 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.149
 are on display 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.179
 collection of rare butterflies 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.629
 or 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.370
 for example you need to demonstrate 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.579
 rare book page 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 like this photo 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.759
 here 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.839
 premiere 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.339
 using 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.339
 chamber document 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.829
 in the classroom m fine 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.229
 art 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.799
 can demonstrate how 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.399
 student work and 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.399
 works of famous masters for training 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.979
 You can of course ask why. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.539
 camera document itself and faith see 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.530
 for posterity 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.270
 oh i will answer that 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.319
 company 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.409
 but rather the things that produce for these 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.569
 document camera is developing 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.319
 specially for use 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.319
 educational institutions 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.310
 and they are very well adapted 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.669
 it is for k rub application in 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.820
 Russian schools among the most important 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.330
 advantages 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.229
 m can be noted 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.120
 just from str mastering use

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.870
 paris materials favor these cameras 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.349
 percentage alexey such important accessories 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.439
 as an adapter to connect 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.469
 microscope 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.899
 backlight tablets for translucent

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.050
 reliability 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.250
 as well as advanced software 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.250
 security 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.739
 most productive document from to measures 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.320

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.000
 project is an integral part 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.940
 conficker reserve but instead preferred 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.940
 place teachers 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.490
 while its capabilities are very valuable 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.969
 expands with the enclosed 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.099
 software 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.479
 And How 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.039
 work with this program 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.639
 provisional we talk in 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.889
 further st 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.870
 more detail in all the feature of them 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.339
 of application 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.289
 document cameras 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.009
 career weight you can 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.460
 find out prices on the site dedicated 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.360
 children cameras 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.939
 whose address you see on screen is three 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.939
 double camera vision rub 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:29.930
 thank you bye
