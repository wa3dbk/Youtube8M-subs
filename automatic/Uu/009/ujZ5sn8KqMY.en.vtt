00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.900
 my Sir 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.130
 by the tulillo 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.579
 that's why its three the same unit 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.599
 in a close embrace the three 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.319
 in the club and me 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:15.229
 me you and him 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.199
 you the cigarette 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.349
 in an embrace identify you more than forgiveness 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.989
 I understand it I love it 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 I want it 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.339
 continues in a few minutes a reptile I tend these feelings 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.270
 writing their names in the notebook 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 forgiveness of understanding 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.300
 our general principle 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.370
 If we knew how to understand, we would not need personal 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.440
 bring to mind that person with whom they have serious conflicts and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 apply the following reflection is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 out of exceptional cases 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 nobody acts with bad intention 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.130
 you will not be attributing to him perverse intentions that he never 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.330
 He had 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 in the end who the unjust temuco you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450
 who is wrong 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.500
 although it makes you suffer so much 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.130
 cha penn are how you will make him suffer 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.729
 who knows if he notified what he was told he said 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.140
 borloo said the other context or in a moment of obfuscation 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.040
 In a moment of nervousness any of us is able to say things 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.300
 of which we regret a few minutes 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.840
 in him he looks proud he is not proud he is shy 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.490
 shyness and pride though 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 so different they have the same face 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.329
 his attitude to me seems obstinacy is not stubbornness is a 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.169
 need for self-affirmation 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.769
 his looks like aggression against me but it's really a way of 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.739
 give security also the problem is with me not with me 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.629
 if he is difficult for me more than difficult for himself 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.980
 if with that way of being suffered much more suffer the same 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.129
 If there is a person interested in not being that way, that person does not just have to 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.089
 obey 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.480
 if the wishing will not be like that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.350
 doing everything possible to change does not get changed will have so much guilt 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.439
 as you attribute it 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.529
 would like to please everyone and it does not please anyone, that is why it is a 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 way of being that there is the nose chosen 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.959
 would like to live in peace with everyone and is always in conflict with everyone 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.169
 would like to be charming the ies tasteless 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.399
 perhaps he chose the eees is a way of being 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.369
 what is the point of being irritated against a way of being that the chosen node 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.429
 it will be that it deserves rejection 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.439
 there was understanding and mercy 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.659
 at the end in my relationship with him who the unjust the goyo 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:31.569
 I will not be the one wrong in maintaining that hostility and rejection of him 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.949
 If we knew how to understand 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.359
 it would not be necessary to forgive 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.529
 I continue in a few minutes 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.529
 applying these reflections to well-known people 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.859
 writing down the names in the notebook
