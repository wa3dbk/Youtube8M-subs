possibly<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.430> casing<00:03:55.909> is<00:03:55.940> stripped<00:03:56.450> now<00:03:56.599> this

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
possibly the casing is stripped now this

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.319 
possibly the casing is stripped now this
is<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> used<00:03:57.290> drive

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
is a used drive

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:06.330 
is a used drive
I<00:03:59.379> did<00:04:00.379> buy<00:04:00.530> used<00:04:00.950> have<00:04:01.370> not<00:04:01.609> tested<00:04:01.849> it<00:04:02.209> yet

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.479 

let's<00:04:07.340> try<00:04:07.609> again<00:04:08.709> if<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.859> still<00:04:10.129> can't<00:04:10.340> get

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
let's try again if I still can't get

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.000 
let's try again if I still can't get
this<00:04:10.760> I'm<00:04:10.970> going<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.150> skip<00:04:11.420> this<00:04:11.599> screw<00:04:12.019> free

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
this I'm going to skip this screw free

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.279 
this I'm going to skip this screw free
out<00:04:13.129> a<00:04:13.159> four<00:04:13.519> smell<00:04:13.849> too<00:04:14.090> bad<00:04:16.720> there<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.810> goes

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
out a four smell too bad there it goes

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.960 
out a four smell too bad there it goes
just<00:04:18.919> head<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.400> looks<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.849> maybe

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
just head that it looks like just maybe

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.270 
just head that it looks like just maybe
the<00:04:20.180> top<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.750> was<00:04:20.900> stripped<00:04:21.380> on<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.859> actual

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
the top of it was stripped on the actual

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.560 
the top of it was stripped on the actual
solid-state<00:04:22.970> drive<00:04:24.729> but<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:26.000> know<00:04:26.300> when

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
solid-state drive but you know when

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.870 
solid-state drive but you know when
you're<00:04:26.630> buying<00:04:26.840> stuff<00:04:27.199> use<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:28.160> might<00:04:28.760> have

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
you're buying stuff use you might have

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.779 
you're buying stuff use you might have
to<00:04:28.970> deal<00:04:29.120> with<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.690> sort<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.960> thing

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
to deal with that sort of thing

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.740 
to deal with that sort of thing
and<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:31.910> wouldn't<00:04:32.060> be<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.300> end<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.539> world

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
and it wouldn't be the end of the world

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.540 
and it wouldn't be the end of the world
if<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.229> only<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:33.560> three<00:04:33.860> screws<00:04:34.130> in<00:04:34.400> there

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
if you only have three screws in there

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.279 
if you only have three screws in there
so<00:04:35.389> let's<00:04:36.020> put<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.199> back<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:37.750> start<00:04:38.750> at<00:04:39.020> this

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
so let's put that back in start at this

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:51.070 
so let's put that back in start at this
end<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:47.199> make<00:04:48.199> sure<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:49.690> connects<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.870> there

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
end and make sure it connects in there

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.040 
end and make sure it connects in there
push<00:04:51.349> it<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.889> way<00:04:53.110> let's<00:04:54.110> put<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.099> our<00:04:55.190> two

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
push it this way let's put in our two

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:10.870 
push it this way let's put in our two
carrier<00:04:57.050> mounting<00:04:57.560> screws

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.130 

make<00:05:11.880> sure<00:05:12.000> those<00:05:12.150> are<00:05:12.180> snug<00:05:12.600> but<00:05:12.810> not<00:05:12.840> over

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
make sure those are snug but not over

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.260 
make sure those are snug but not over
tightened<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:14.220> you'll<00:05:14.340> notice<00:05:14.610> our<00:05:14.790> keyboard

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
tightened so you'll notice our keyboard

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.630 
tightened so you'll notice our keyboard
it<00:05:15.870> has<00:05:15.900> these<00:05:16.170> these<00:05:16.230> clips<00:05:16.920> that<00:05:17.100> align<00:05:17.400> down

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
it has these these clips that align down

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.390 
it has these these clips that align down
here<00:05:18.030> now<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:18.960> also<00:05:19.140> have<00:05:19.320> plastic<00:05:19.980> clips<00:05:20.220> on

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
here now you also have plastic clips on

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.990 
here now you also have plastic clips on
the<00:05:20.520> side<00:05:20.790> may<00:05:22.010> focus<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.160> over<00:05:23.400> here<00:05:23.670> so<00:05:23.940> you

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
the side may focus is over here so you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.760 
the side may focus is over here so you
have<00:05:24.150> these<00:05:24.330> clips<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.440> have<00:05:25.530> these

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
have these clips and you have these

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.340 
have these clips and you have these
clips<00:05:26.280> two<00:05:26.670> on<00:05:27.540> each<00:05:27.720> side

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
clips two on each side

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.660 
clips two on each side
so<00:05:28.860> first<00:05:29.340> thing<00:05:29.700> is<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:31.680> push<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.310> all<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.520> way

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
so first thing is to push it all the way

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:42.770 
so first thing is to push it all the way
this<00:05:33.330> way<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.680> then<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:36.720> can<00:05:41.570> work<00:05:42.570> around

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
this way and then you can work around

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.580 
this way and then you can work around
and<00:05:43.460> make<00:05:44.460> sure<00:05:44.640> these<00:05:44.820> side<00:05:45.210> clips<00:05:45.660> are

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
and make sure these side clips are

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.500 
and make sure these side clips are
attached<00:05:47.070> on<00:05:47.400> right<00:05:48.390> here<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.050> right<00:05:49.260> here<00:05:50.510> it

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
attached on right here and right here it

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.510 
attached on right here and right here it
should<00:05:51.810> be<00:05:51.870> flush<00:05:52.590> with<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.310> palm<00:05:53.490> rest

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
should be flush with the palm rest

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.400 
should be flush with the palm rest
assembly<00:05:54.270> this<00:05:54.900> bottom<00:05:55.350> piece<00:05:55.530> should<00:05:56.250> be

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
assembly this bottom piece should be

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.900 
assembly this bottom piece should be
flush<00:05:58.410> here<00:05:58.800> there<00:05:58.980> should<00:05:59.010> be<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.280> gap<00:05:59.580> and

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
flush here there should be a gap and

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.620 
flush here there should be a gap and
you'll<00:06:00.270> notice<00:06:00.510> a<00:06:00.660> bulge<00:06:00.960> in<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:02.580> top<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:03.480> can

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
you'll notice a bulge in the top you can

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.780 
you'll notice a bulge in the top you can
kind<00:06:03.780> of<00:06:03.840> push<00:06:03.990> that<00:06:04.110> down<00:06:04.290> for<00:06:04.530> now<00:06:04.760> flip<00:06:05.760> it
