basically<00:02:06.020> first<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.409> need

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
basically first thing you're gonna need

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
basically first thing you're gonna need
to<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.250> also<00:02:09.179> you're<00:02:09.300> gonna<00:02:09.390> need<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> have

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to do is also you're gonna need to have

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.370 
to do is also you're gonna need to have
two<00:02:10.530> slopes<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.459> yours<00:02:12.060> once<00:02:12.420> though

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
two slopes so yours once though

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900 
two slopes so yours once though
here's<00:02:13.500> another<00:02:13.560> one<00:02:13.800> basically<00:02:14.340> facing<00:02:14.550> left

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
here's another one basically facing left

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.320 
here's another one basically facing left
and<00:02:15.030> right<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.650> yeah<00:02:16.650> alright<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:18.180> gonna

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
go ahead and go over the slopes first

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.930 
go ahead and go over the slopes first
because<00:02:19.830> those<00:02:19.920> are<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> easiest<00:02:20.430> part<00:02:20.730> here

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
because those are the easiest part here

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.880 
because those are the easiest part here
so<00:02:21.510> basically<00:02:21.660> we're<00:02:21.990> gonna<00:02:22.140> need<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.530> for

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
so basically we're gonna need to do for

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.190 
so basically we're gonna need to do for
the<00:02:23.040> slope<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.670> our<00:02:24.000> slopes<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.810> make<00:02:25.080> sure

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the slope is our slopes is make sure

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 
the slope is our slopes is make sure
they're<00:02:25.380> bolts<00:02:25.710> check<00:02:25.800> solid<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.390> have

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
they're bolts check solid and they have

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.560 
they're bolts check solid and they have
a<00:02:27.570> parent<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.320> your<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.370> your<00:02:29.550> ground<00:02:29.910> object

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
a parent of your of your ground object

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.460 
a parent of your of your ground object
which<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> my<00:02:30.960> case<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.470> collision<00:02:31.950> block<00:02:33.470> so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
which in my case is a collision block so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.140 
which in my case is a collision block so
yeah<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.190> ground<00:02:35.520> object<00:02:36.000> you're

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
yeah if you have a ground object you're

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.790 
yeah if you have a ground object you're
gonna<00:02:36.240> want<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.600> parented<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:37.320> your<00:02:37.500> ground

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
to go to the keyboard left event and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.520 
to go to the keyboard left event and
basically<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:01.020> you<00:03:01.110> already<00:03:01.170> have

them move and such and switch it out for
some<00:03:14.100> some<00:03:14.550> code<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.960> put<00:03:16.710> this<00:03:16.800> code<00:03:17.070> in

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
some some code and just put this code in

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.550 
some some code and just put this code in
here<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:18.060> already<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.630> code<00:03:21.560> we'll

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
here and I already have this code we'll

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
here and I already have this code we'll
put<00:03:22.740> this<00:03:22.860> code<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> description<00:03:23.670> box<00:03:23.820> so

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
put this code in the description box so

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.940 
put this code in the description box so
if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.690> don't<00:03:24.960> have<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.680> most

paste<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.740> just<00:03:53.100> go<00:03:53.220> into<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.700> description

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
paste it or just go into the description

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.360 
paste it or just go into the description
box<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.840> look<00:03:55.020> for<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.470> keyboard<00:03:55.709> write<00:03:56.130> code

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
box and look for the keyboard write code

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.040 
box and look for the keyboard write code
and<00:03:56.610> basically<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.480> only<00:03:57.510> thing<00:03:57.750> that's

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
and basically the only thing that's

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.990 
and basically the only thing that's
changed<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.530> basically<00:03:58.860> pretty<00:03:59.220> much<00:03:59.340> all<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
changed is basically pretty much all the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.050 
changed is basically pretty much all the
other<00:04:00.360> fours<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.830> code<00:04:02.070> have<00:04:02.850> been

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
other fours in this code have been

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.040 
other fours in this code have been
replaced<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:04.110> with<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> minus<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.390> plus

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
replaced with with a minus to the plus

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.970 
replaced with with a minus to the plus
sign<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.940> as<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.390> see<00:04:10.020> there's<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.440> plus

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
sign there so as you see there's a plus

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.980 
sign there so as you see there's a plus
there<00:04:11.190> plus<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.790> air<00:04:11.880> plus<00:04:12.090> they're<00:04:12.420> there

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
there plus the air plus they're there

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.849 
there plus the air plus they're there
and<00:04:13.340> basically<00:04:14.690> after<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.709> want

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
and basically after that you just want

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.539 
and basically after that you just want
to<00:04:16.920> go<00:04:17.010> ahead<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:18.000> room<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:19.549> go

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
