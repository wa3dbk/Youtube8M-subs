 Newcomers have been playing with us for many years and we have been alone. 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 We have to be quiet and play the same song we know from that day on. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.140
 A liar has taken our lives and now we are trapped here to rot 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.780
 Please let us in! Don't lock us out! We are not like you think 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.240
 We are just a poor little soul who is out of control, so we are forced to do so. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 We have always been lonely in our small area since 1987 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.860
 Join us and become our friends or just be a beastly beast. After all, you only have

 Five nights at Freddy's Restaurant 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.580
 Is this the place you want to stay? 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.640
 I just don't understand 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.080
 Why are you staying?

 Five nights at Freddy's Restaurant 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.460
 We are really surprised that we can see you on another night. 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.020
 We can see you on another night, you should have said, goodbye to this place. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 As if there are a lot of memories, maybe you were in this place before. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 We have seen you in your impressions and you seem to be familiar with those doors! 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.820
