00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
fighting on for that extra even just 10

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
fighting on for that extra even just 10
second<00:02:12.430> you're<00:02:12.700> getting<00:02:12.939> better<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.989> just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
second you're getting better so just

second you're getting better so just
when<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.799> get<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.099> point<00:02:15.219> just<00:02:15.640> think

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
when you get to that point just think

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.059 
when you get to that point just think
another<00:02:16.209> 10<00:02:16.450> seconds<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.290> every<00:02:17.890> time

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
another 10 seconds more and every time

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.199 
another 10 seconds more and every time
you<00:02:18.159> do<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.640> you'll<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.819> better<00:02:18.969> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209
