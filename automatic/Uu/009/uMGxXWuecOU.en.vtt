3 gigabytes of video buffer that is and

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.949 
3 gigabytes of video buffer that is and

it's a gddr5 graphics card of course and

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.319 
it's a gddr5 graphics card of course and
the<00:03:38.590> thing<00:03:38.799> about<00:03:38.829> this<00:03:39.220> GPU<00:03:39.729> is<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.150> only

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
the thing about this GPU is the only

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.110 
the thing about this GPU is the only
downside<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.409> it<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.949> it<00:03:42.099> isn't<00:03:42.729> a<00:03:42.819> part

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
downside to it is that it isn't a part

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.899 
downside to it is that it isn't a part
of<00:03:43.329> ambe's<00:03:44.079> never<00:03:44.319> settle<00:03:44.650> forever

of ambe's never settle forever

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.420 
of ambe's never settle forever
promotionals<00:03:45.909> but<00:03:46.750> i<00:03:47.019> think<00:03:47.919> the<00:03:48.040> trade-off

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
promotionals but i think the trade-off

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.490 
promotionals but i think the trade-off
is<00:03:48.459> worth<00:03:48.819> it<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.209> i<00:03:49.479> think<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.260> know

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
is worth it and i think that you know

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.990 
is worth it and i think that you know
