00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
more than normal

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.940 
more than normal
I<00:01:52.570> mean<00:01:53.570> maybe<00:01:53.780> give<00:01:53.960> me<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.080> little<00:01:54.380> energy<00:01:54.679> but

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
I mean maybe give me a little energy but

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.090 
I mean maybe give me a little energy but
not<00:01:55.130> nearly<00:01:55.640> as<00:01:55.789> much<00:01:55.940> as<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.800> said<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:57.920> was

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
not nearly as much as it said it was

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.210 
not nearly as much as it said it was
going<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.479> would<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.619> recommend<00:02:00.860> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
going to so I would not recommend that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.370 
going to so I would not recommend that
product<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.030> new<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:02.690> they<00:02:02.990> probably<00:02:03.080> don't

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
product it's new so they probably don't

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.469 
product it's new so they probably don't
have<00:02:03.440> much<00:02:03.560> feedback<00:02:03.830> on<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.240> don't<00:02:05.240> buy<00:02:05.360> it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
have much feedback on it don't buy it
