to it this guitar is definitely an

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
to it this guitar is definitely an
interesting<00:00:34.829> move<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.760> Ibanez<00:00:36.059> they're

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
interesting move for Ibanez they're

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
interesting move for Ibanez they're
slowly<00:00:36.660> trying<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.379> their<00:00:37.710> mid<00:00:38.489> range

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
notice right away is the the new bridge

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
notice right away is the the new bridge
they've<00:00:47.280> got<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> version<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.720> it<00:00:48.870> coming<00:00:49.110> out

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
they've got a version of it coming out

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.790 
they've got a version of it coming out
on<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.440> guitars<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.340> edge<00:00:51.150> is<00:00:51.510> 0<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> believe

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
on these guitars the edge is 0 I believe

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160 
on these guitars the edge is 0 I believe
it's<00:00:52.950> called<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.820> 0<00:00:54.120> 2<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.750> technically

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it's called at 0 2 on this technically

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's called at 0 2 on this technically
because<00:00:55.380> it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.920> well<00:00:56.790> Indonesian<00:00:57.450> made<00:00:58.460> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because it's a well Indonesian made it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
because it's a well Indonesian made it's
really<00:00:59.790> cool<00:00:59.970> because<00:01:00.149> you've<00:01:00.420> got<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:01.160> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
really cool because you've got all the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.710 
really cool because you've got all the
adjustments<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.059> back<00:01:03.239> for

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
adjustments you need on the back for

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.050 
adjustments you need on the back for
setting<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> tension<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> bridge<00:01:05.790> as

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
setting the tension of the bridge as

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.789 
setting the tension of the bridge as
well<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.869> probably<00:01:07.290> won't<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.500> able<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.649> see

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
well you probably won't be able to see

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
well you probably won't be able to see
it<00:01:07.860> too<00:01:08.040> easily<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> barring<00:01:09.570> right

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it too easily but this is barring right

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590 
it too easily but this is barring right
there<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.619> blocks<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.579> the<00:01:11.610> trim<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.329> if

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
there which blocks out the trim so if

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940 
there which blocks out the trim so if
you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.079> make<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> floating<00:01:13.770> bridge

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you want to make this a floating bridge

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.170 
you want to make this a floating bridge
all<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> pull<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> backplate

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
all you do is you pull off the backplate

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
all you do is you pull off the backplate
remove<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.930> thing<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.070> you're<00:01:17.280> ready

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
remove that thing and then you're ready

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.389

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
to go out warbly on everything it's

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.980 
to go out warbly on everything it's
really<00:01:20.520> easy<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.149> adjust<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.689> you've<00:01:21.899> got

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

your<00:01:22.850> nice<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.179> battery<00:01:25.130> section<00:01:26.130> here

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
your nice little battery section here

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.230 
your nice little battery section here
for<00:01:26.399> your<00:01:27.259> active<00:01:28.729> circuitry<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.909> nice<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
for your active circuitry it's nice to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
for your active circuitry it's nice to
get<00:01:30.359> to<00:01:30.569> so<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:31.499> back<00:01:31.709> is<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.249> one

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
get to so the back is actually one

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.919 
get to so the back is actually one
really<00:01:33.029> cool<00:01:33.179> thing<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> guitar<00:01:33.749> that

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
really cool thing about the guitar that

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.639 
really cool thing about the guitar that
I<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.679> appreciate<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> electronics<00:01:37.590> are

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
I really appreciate the electronics are

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.739 
I really appreciate the electronics are
a<00:01:37.679> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> different<00:01:38.450> from<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
a little bit different from what you

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.449 
a little bit different from what you
would<00:01:39.840> normally<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.799> guitar<00:01:40.950> we've<00:01:41.279> got

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
would normally see on a guitar we've got

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.169 
would normally see on a guitar we've got
this<00:01:41.850> active<00:01:42.509> EQ<00:01:43.469> switch<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.179> basically

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
this active EQ switch which basically

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.489 
this active EQ switch which basically
switches<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:46.079> being<00:01:46.349> a<00:01:46.649> flat<00:01:47.219> sound<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
switches it from being a flat sound to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.629 
switches it from being a flat sound to
something<00:01:49.499> that's<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> bit<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.069> an<00:01:50.159> EQ

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:50.639 
something that's got a bit of an EQ

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.699 
something that's got a bit of an EQ
scoop<00:01:51.029> in<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.299> middle<00:01:51.569> we've<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:52.679> a

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
scoop in the middle we've got a

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.919 
scoop in the middle we've got a
three-way<00:01:53.159> toggle<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.749> standard

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
three-way toggle so it's pretty standard

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.919 
three-way toggle so it's pretty standard
