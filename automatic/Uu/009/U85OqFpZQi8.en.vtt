edition right here is it has a new

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.240 
edition right here is it has a new
finish<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.119> upper<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> synthetic

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
finish on the upper it's got a synthetic

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.990 
finish on the upper it's got a synthetic
leather<00:01:38.820> finish<00:01:39.320> instead<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.729> suede<00:01:41.729> finish

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
leather finish instead of a suede finish

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.410

like<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> launch<00:01:43.200> colorway<00:01:43.560> hab<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.420> they

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like the launch colorway hab and they

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.039 
like the launch colorway hab and they
did<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.970> wouldn't<00:01:48.390> rip<00:01:48.899> as

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
did that I think so it wouldn't rip as

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.060 
did that I think so it wouldn't rip as
much<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> lot<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
much because there was a lot of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.270 
much because there was a lot of

that<00:02:27.150> well<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.079> which<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.439> actually<00:02:28.680> more<00:02:29.430> of

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
that well but which is actually more of

that well but which is actually more of
a<00:02:29.939> pink<00:02:30.829> than<00:02:31.829> a<00:02:31.859> red<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.000> light<00:02:33.299> pink

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
a pink than a red it's like a light pink

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.440 
a pink than a red it's like a light pink
mixed<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.439> a<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.620> bit<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.010> red<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.939> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
mixed with a little bit of red but the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.949 
mixed with a little bit of red but the
color<00:02:36.780> coding<00:02:37.079> is<00:02:37.319> are<00:02:37.620> 255<00:02:38.519> green<00:02:39.239> zero<00:02:39.629> and

color coding is are 255 green zero and

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.740 
color coding is are 255 green zero and
blue<00:02:40.260> 128<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:42.390> pretty<00:02:42.510> much<00:02:42.569> just

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
blue 128 and you can pretty much just

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.720 
blue 128 and you can pretty much just
take<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> home<00:02:43.470> depot<00:02:43.680> or<00:02:43.920> any<00:02:44.430> color

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
take that to a home depot or any color

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.819 
take that to a home depot or any color
store<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.569> I'll<00:02:45.659> just<00:02:45.930> recreate<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.560> color

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
store and I'll just recreate that color

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.170 
store and I'll just recreate that color
which<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.190> pretty<00:02:47.340> neat<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.030> that's

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
which is pretty neat I think that's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.050
