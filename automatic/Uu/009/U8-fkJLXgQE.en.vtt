00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
where most conductors do it too quick

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.020 
where most conductors do it too quick
because<00:03:00.590> they<00:03:00.860> get<00:03:01.010> all<00:03:01.190> enthusiastic<00:03:01.700> can<00:03:01.970> I

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.900 

I<00:03:38.470> find<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.590> difficult<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:40.160> come<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> grips

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I find it difficult to come to grips

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.930 
I find it difficult to come to grips
with<00:03:41.120> early<00:03:42.110> Mozart<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:43.069> of<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.400> courtly

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
with early Mozart because of the courtly

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.600 
with early Mozart because of the courtly
aspect<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.110> numerable<00:03:45.860> Cadence's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
aspect the the numerable Cadence's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.110 
aspect the the numerable Cadence's
innumerable<00:03:47.480> Rococo<00:03:48.440> sort<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.120> twiddling

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
innumerable Rococo sort of twiddling

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.589 
innumerable Rococo sort of twiddling
that<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:50.660> on<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.019> find<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.010> sort<00:03:52.879> of<00:03:53.030> difficult

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
that go on I find it sort of difficult

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.240 
that go on I find it sort of difficult
but<00:03:53.959> it's<00:03:54.080> these<00:03:54.170> are<00:03:54.230> these<00:03:54.650> simple<00:03:55.040> pieces

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
but it's these are these simple pieces

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.520 
but it's these are these simple pieces
the<00:03:56.239> more<00:03:56.420> famous<00:03:56.690> they<00:03:57.019> are<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.410> more

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
the more famous they are and the more

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.680 
the more famous they are and the more
simple<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.010> are<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:59.120> more<00:03:59.299> difficulty

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
simple they are the more difficulty

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.780 
simple they are the more difficulty
becoming<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.950> why<00:04:01.099> for<00:04:01.430> some<00:04:01.549> that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
becoming so this is why for some that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.449 
becoming so this is why for some that
have<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.090> say<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.239> lot<00:04:02.510> they<00:04:03.319> won't<00:04:03.799> be<00:04:04.099> that<00:04:04.250> is

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
have to say a lot they won't be that is

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.449 
have to say a lot they won't be that is
almost<00:04:05.060> impossible<00:04:05.480> yes<00:04:06.019> yes<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.980> challenge

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
almost impossible yes yes the challenge

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.220 
almost impossible yes yes the challenge
of<00:04:07.580> playing<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.849> Mozart<00:04:08.239> concerto<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.110> he

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.220 
does such beautiful things but there's
so<00:04:10.610> many<00:04:10.730> different<00:04:11.239> ways<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.450> they<00:04:11.840> could

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
so many different ways that they could

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.390 
so many different ways that they could
be<00:04:12.590> playing<00:04:13.630> those<00:04:14.630> no<00:04:14.840> rights<00:04:15.079> your<00:04:15.319> forte<00:04:15.829> he
