00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.980
 it's time again in mortal 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.690
 kombat the deadliest tournament in the world 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.690
 it is again hard and merciless 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.850
 But as far as things go , we will witness again 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.590
 from a huge wealth of ideas in relation 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.840
 on the injury of human body 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.580
 And trying new things in the matter 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.530
 Achieve violence representation 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.790
 else to offer the motto competec 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 you have experience here 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.660
 the fight between the so-called 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.489
 outside world and the earth is rich after 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.440
 How to find the big topic yet 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.739
 fight this time off the tournament 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.180
 instead of 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.190
 sherlock tries people 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.580
 attack and is just so of 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.660
 the representatives of the good at it prevented 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.460
 real action takes 30 years 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.380
 Later , John Cage is in the years 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.690
 come and show not only due 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.759
 gray hair that age also for him 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.320
 do not stop together with sonya 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.790
 blade he already has a daughter 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160
 even old enough 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.990
 to fight on his side this became 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.610
 sent out with three other warriors 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.410
 to stop a change of power 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.570
 the great thing about the story is the 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.710
 narrative at any time you have that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.090
 feeling that the story is round 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.289
 is played or fast a few 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.940
 to link struggles 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.890
 it rather creates the impression of one 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.390
 interactive history this will too 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.770
 supported by quick time events 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.710
 cheer you up and that happen on 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.970
 keep alive 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.890
 Although you would not set new standards for 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.000
 the series or the genre is still set 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.290
 The campaign is a very fresh one 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.470
 experience and the transitions between 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.490
 film and game play are well staged 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.530
 the presentation also goes one step 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.299
 further than they were used to 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.920
 on the one hand there is the technical aspect 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.140
 mortal kombat ex migrates to the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 current console generation in 1080p 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740
 and 60 pictures per second about the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.509
 This will benefit the screen 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 fast movements of the fighting enormously 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.470
 The degree of detail was neat 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.910
 screwed up both the environment 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.799
 as well as the fighters themselves act 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.579
 very plastic and nice 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.110
 to look 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.209
 In some scenes, you would 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.209
 but a little less wish 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.239
 become weak also in the newest 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.370
 mortal kombat litter on a hard 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.530
 rehearsed for what the you since 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.480
 the last part of popular x-ray cameras 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.769
 here at times could show off already 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.550
 a book about the human anatomy 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.750
 But that's exactly what it's all about 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.400
 violence is so exaggerated 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.110
 that she slips off in these animals and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.420
 the same fun as movies from the genre 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.190
 Trasch horror delivers the menu 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.200
 Displays are very noble in us 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.709
 more contemporary than the predecessor nor the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.239
 case was 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 that's the way to say so 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.950
 that no mortal kombat play better 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.180
 looked like a mortal kombat ex that the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.950
 Isolation not on the same 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.569
 level though, the votes are good 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.190
 cast properly spoken yet 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.049
 they are often very asynchronous 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.049
 unfortunately happens again and again today 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.810
 alternatively you can of course on the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.220
 change english language 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.630
 not affected by this problem 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.519
 is around after almost 23 years in Rome one 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.709
 you need to keep a series upright 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.510
 much flair that is art 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.200
 it brings a fresh wind through innovations 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.880
 to create 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.530
 but at the same time the basic formula too 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.579
 get around the proven feel 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.350
 not to change 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.940
 here mortal kombat ex all 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.829
 The battles feel right 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.299
 fast and brute and still there 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.799
 it's a great rebuke for a couple of updates 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.510
 match previous game principle 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.549
 the most obvious of these innovations 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.170
 are the selectable fighting styles outside 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.180
 You have the campaign with every fighter 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.100
 The choice between three play design 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.819
 move set and its tactical design 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.500
 change 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.750
 it increases the number of possible 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.519
 clash and give extra 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.260
 passionate players the possibility 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.569
 to penetrate even deeper into the game 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.670
 and your own playing style too 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.630
 perfect 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.730
 otherwise you will get what we 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.680
 expected uncompromising and tough 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.209
 action with a large portion ouch 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.209

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.820

 the total of eight different towers 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.739
 three of them at regular intervals 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.480
 to be changed 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.470
 In addition, the choice of the group comes 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.600
