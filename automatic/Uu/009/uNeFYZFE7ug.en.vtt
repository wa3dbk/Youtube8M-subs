00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.000
 all good dear tankers with you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.770
 repairs 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.190
 today will tell you how to make a game 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.199
 your team not being in the top of the list 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 but somewhere in the middle on the pass map 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.220
 because when we are in the top I showed 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 how can you storm and now pay 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.210
 attention to the stages and here how to rule 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 it will be very difficult because very 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 many traders who will be me 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 punch and so forth it would seem so what 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.530
 here to do someone fifth like here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 taxi but precisely to 5 made the game 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 my team by the way I have 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.590
 comments appeared there some 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 question 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.930
 I would like to answer it tanker name 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 martin he's extras and so martin what what 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 you are interested 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.190
 hi al-mulk why don't you speak 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.350
 in a cheerful and sweet voice like this 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.350
 do many surveyors 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.380
 thank you martin for the question first 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 reasons and 2 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.920
 The first reason is because I have 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.560
 the channel has no advertising and and therefore will not 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.930
 I don't need to like 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.170
 absolutely everything so that's what I have here 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.680
 voice and the other will not and the second 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.610
 the reason is that I don't like Freddie 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.580
 mercury 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.150
 and the country of holland 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.530
 so well let's get one more question from 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:55.880
 an anonymous tanker but also an extra 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.729
 yes my dear friend ask your question 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.729
 hi repair at the expense of what you bend eat 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.729
 extras 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.890
 thank you friend for asking this first 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.310
 testosterone you and patches and the second is 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.100
 what extras 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.390
 very predictable and because they play by 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.300
 Guides, I probably know where to go top 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.400
 DPS top opponent's tyazh where to go 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 fri-patches and so on therefore for the account 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 unexpected maneuvers and due to the fact 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 that I know all the moves and outputs of extras 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.970
 get such tricks like now so what 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.840
 Well setup and of course not so hot not so hot 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 I know that most of us will go 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.620
 on the right and on the left I know what the rituals 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.019
 will bridge the bridge 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.510
 as often happens on the pass card you 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:10.410
 already noticed here I decided to go straight 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.440
 on the mountain bernes gorochka waters hollow 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:19.450
 why because neither right nor left me 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.510
 don't break it secondly i love 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.750
 very original themes that are often 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.720
 rolled in third and here in this 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.959
 hollows can flip small bubbles 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:40.859
 usually not here hang out highlight 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:43.740
 superpershing here i find the bubble fine 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.840
 which 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.360
 which principle has nowhere to go like 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:54.990
 only here to hang out well I have become 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:59.400
 there he is not a tenant our guys shot him 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.820
 due to my light on super peach 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.970
 it fired fired cool until I 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.190
 drove 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:12.180
 up it took off and what do we see 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.500
 see that gentlemen extras go 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.190
 right and left and look i'm leaving with 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.459
 this little hill 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 and there is nobody here absolutely nobody 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.590
 given that I was in the highlight then 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.730
 eat and did not leave unexpectedly convolutions hop 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.010
 meet friends no i was highlighted 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.450
 firstly fr-shki second super pepper 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.410
 and here's how to look at the right and the left 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.740
 flank all there is nobody here like this 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.630
 here's friends will never be in the new 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.390
 sometime and do not read boring 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:54.270
 guides played unexpectedly believe the game 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.250
 acquires a completely different meaning because 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.050
 that once upon a time I played 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.910
 ok as everything is all right 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.390
 under the closet bushes strands tank 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.800
 and so on in general, all this murk 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.050
 then it really bored me 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.430
 very bored I lost my taste 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.050
 to the game and decided to play it so me 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.700
 really brought pleasure and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.520
 besides pleasure , victory 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:25.440
 preferably not tricks 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.870
 roll not always of course but more 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.389
 parts but more than half of my fights they 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.300
 always funny 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:38.620
 that's what watching three minutes I passed 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:47.800
 standing on the enemy base only poor to 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:51.819
 13 decided to defend their base Respect 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.370
 he is such a small weak tank after all 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.189
 snaps at a big 5 who protect 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:01.360
 base everything else by the way on the drum 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:04.750
 pay attention pay attention to everyone 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.279
 on the drum, they probably do not even see 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:14.229
 on minimap I'm standing here 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:17.500
 unfortunately yes very sad story 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.990
 so if you appear somewhere on 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.909
 who is the fifth here is the middle of the list either 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:28.169
 in general below, I strongly advise you to 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:32.620
 Drivers for 5 I think what and 4 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.490
 act like this first 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.490
 it is very unexpected 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.870
 He is here our fights with the left 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.140
 that's all literally in the first five minutes 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.950
 we solved all questions absolutely everything 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.810
 questions brought victory to the team got 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.810
 positive emotions and what else is needed
