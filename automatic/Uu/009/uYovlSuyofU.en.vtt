00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
positions that's pretty much arrays and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
positions that's pretty much arrays and
here<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:29.880> gonna<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> correct<00:00:30.570> play

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
here we're gonna see the correct play

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.490 
here we're gonna see the correct play
which<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> raise<00:00:32.690> now<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> action<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> on

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
which is the raise now the action is on

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.110 
which is the raise now the action is on
the<00:00:34.620> small<00:00:35.010> blind<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> he's<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.730> ace<00:00:35.880> king

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the small blind and he's got ace king

the small blind and he's got ace king
let<00:00:36.300> me<00:00:36.390> stop<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.800> bet<00:00:38.010> was

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
let me stop it right there the bet was

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.520 
let me stop it right there the bet was
way<00:00:38.370> too<00:00:38.430> big<00:00:38.879> compared<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> his<00:00:40.020> stack<00:00:40.260> size

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
way too big compared to his stack size

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
way too big compared to his stack size
at<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.770> point<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.160> call<00:00:41.550> sometimes

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
at this point to just call sometimes

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
at this point to just call sometimes
like<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.480> said<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.899> ace<00:00:42.989> king<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> call

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
like I said with ace king you can call

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.760 
like I said with ace king you can call
but<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.520> case<00:00:45.020> Simonian<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.469> needed

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
but in this case Simonian really needed

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.380 
but in this case Simonian really needed
to<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.920> stick<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.820> ace<00:00:47.940> king<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to just stick it in with ace king and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.639 
to just stick it in with ace king and
he'd<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.840> himself<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.530> good

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
he'd get himself in a very good

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
he'd get himself in a very good
situation<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:50.489> his<00:00:50.579> opponent<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.390> ace

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
situation because his opponent with ace

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
situation because his opponent with ace
queen<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.079> gonna<00:00:52.230> call<00:00:52.590> him<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> can

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
queen is gonna call him and as you can

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
queen is gonna call him and as you can
see<00:00:53.489> he'd<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> three<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.660> favor

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
see he'd be about a three to one favor

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
see he'd be about a three to one favor
instead<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:56.039> calling<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.760> he<00:00:56.820> does<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.329> he

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
instead by calling what he does is he

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.200 
instead by calling what he does is he
gives<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.260> blind<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.160> price<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.969> try

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
gives the big blind a good price to try

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
gives the big blind a good price to try
and<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.930> flop<00:01:01.260> something<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.129> he

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and you know flop something now if he

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.439 
and you know flop something now if he
doesn't<00:01:02.550> catch<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.789> ace<00:01:02.910> tracking<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
doesn't catch an ace tracking on the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
doesn't catch an ace tracking on the
flop<00:01:03.660> he's<00:01:04.019> probably<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> check

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
flop he's probably gonna have to check

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.390 
flop he's probably gonna have to check
and<00:01:05.010> fold

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and fold

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
and fold
whereas<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.060> he<00:01:06.119> moves<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.810> he's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
whereas if he moves all in now he's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
whereas if he moves all in now he's
either<00:01:07.409> gonna<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.830> win<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> pot<00:01:08.490> before<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
either gonna a win the pot before the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
either gonna a win the pot before the
flop<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.390> likely<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.320> himself<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> good

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
flop or be likely get himself in a good

situation<00:01:11.130> against<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> screen<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> he<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
situation against a screen so he just

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
calls instead action is on leak hob and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
calls instead action is on leak hob and
he's<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> garbage<00:01:17.310> hand<00:01:17.670> he's<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:17.880> ten

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you know what price is right I'm gonna

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.440 
you know what price is right I'm gonna
take<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> flop<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> three<00:01:23.970> players<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
take a flop with it so three players to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
take a flop with it so three players to
a<00:01:24.479> flop<00:01:25.759> Simonian<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> gonna<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> act

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
a flop Simonian is gonna have to act

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
a flop Simonian is gonna have to act
first<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.590> such<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> big

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
first as well which is just such a big

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
first as well which is just such a big
disadvantage<00:01:29.430> position<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.420> important

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
disadvantage position is so important

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
disadvantage position is so important
and<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.740> he's<00:01:32.009> flop<00:01:32.250> nothing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and now as you can see he's flop nothing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.190 
and now as you can see he's flop nothing
theoretically<00:01:33.150> he<00:01:33.360> has<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> best<00:01:33.780> hand<00:01:34.049> in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
theoretically he has the best hand in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
theoretically he has the best hand in
that<00:01:34.259> ace<00:01:34.439> king<00:01:34.680> highs<00:01:34.829> ahead<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.369> now

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that ace king highs ahead right now

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
that ace king highs ahead right now
but<00:01:36.780> ten<00:01:37.170> three<00:01:37.380> hearts<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.799> leak<00:01:37.920> off<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> the
