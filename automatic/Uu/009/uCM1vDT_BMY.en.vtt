00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.130
 well well found in this very short 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.200
 video I want to share with you i 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.760
 results of experimental tests which 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.910
 carried out by a stove ad 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 alcohol that I built recently there 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 I wish you a good vision 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.220
 the original project dates back to the end 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.040
 from the 1800s and consisted of a generator 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 gas double wall composed of a 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.390
 ring burner with radial out is 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.400
 a coaxial cylindrical chamber of 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.290
 preheating very similar to this 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.360
 model a certain mister at hendrix ramaj 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.050
 a resident of new york made it into an object 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.449
 of a patent in 1904 lapsed by 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.250
 this patent has found the technique over time 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.199
 constructive of this object in tens 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.479
 of movies on youtube and as many sites 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.729
 on the net it is enough to look for words 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.830
 providing alcohol cooker 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.140
 pressurized cooker with cans of 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.549
 beer or even better in English alcohol 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.549
 stop ott in store 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.470
 the closed model is usually the one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.450
 pressurized does not have inside the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.030
 glass wool pad then to the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 increased capacity of around 100 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.610
 milliliters and works only with alcohol 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.870
 avoid absolutely other types 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.760
 of fuels 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.790
 experimentation and at your own risk e 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.790
 danger 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.480
 this 6 mm hole drilled on the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.570
 top of the stove 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.430
 has a dual purpose serves to insert 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.990
 fuel and as rudimentary 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.300
 safety valve for the test 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.660
 I insert 80,000 liters of gas into the stove 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.660
 alcohol 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.350
 after loading or the hole must 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.730
 be closed with a bolt 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.380
 if the pressure rises 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.970
 excessively excess cases 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:47.700
 they will snap through the opening this 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.830
 burner is very efficient but neither 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.440
 remotely comparable to a stove 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 camping obviously not having the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.210
 ignition chamber or staircase from the bottom 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.520
 with a lighter or I switch to its base 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.990
 some wines liters of alcohol needed for 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.610
 to accelerate the evaporation of 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.770
 fuel and then start the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 burner the method and then a little 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.180
 cumbersome the height at which to place the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.830
 kettle from the pressurized stove e 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.450
 a couple of centimeters 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.610
 therefore a support able to 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.530
 hold the weight of the saucepan the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.840
 besides air sensitive cooker which 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.310
 could extinguish the flames then the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.470
 support should also serve as 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.110
 screen and will help to optimize the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.660
 this heat produced product 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.190
 object that serves as a screen support 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.190
 I get it from a can of coffee 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.910
 about half a liter of water 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.910
 inside my pot 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.040
 for this test I prefer to heat 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.280
 my stove using alcohol 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:03.319
 then the towards inside the saucer 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:12.359
 and then setting fire were enough 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:14.989
 two milliliters I take my stove and it 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.989
 put on the saucer 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.790
 as soon as the alcohol inside begins 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.890
 to evaporate the fats they will call 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.290
 at the exit of the nozzles and burners yes 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.970
 will start the heat produced by the flames 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.140
 sufficient to overheat the alcohol e 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.640
 guarantee the presence of vapors 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.880
 flammable the outside ranieri of the 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.880
 burner 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.680
 here you are not done 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.210
 at this point I take the time to 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.620
 measure how much it runs to carry 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.830
 boiling half a liter of water e 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.830
 how long an 80 milliliter charge lasts 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.880
 alcohol burns very clean 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.500
 so it may be difficult to 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.060
 day see the call of the stove 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.230
 or therefore pay close attention 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.230
 not to take sides 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.760
 The water is boiling 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.409
 let us begin to diminish it 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:25.850
 about 33 and 34 minutes have passed 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:27.260
 from the lighting of the stove for the 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.000
 time would have been sufficient to 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.100
 sterilize filtered water for 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.440
 being able to drink it safely or 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.730
 being able to produce an herbal tea 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.890
 decoction certainly does not cook pasta 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.080
 if not exactly a long time al dente 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.650
 it's the limit I could heat minestrone 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.650
 in box 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.400
 in conclusion I would like to say that the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.880
 classic gas stove is definitely 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.410
 more functional but the intervention of the video 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.260
 it is not to mortify this 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.390
 object to show that even objects 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.540
 created with recycled material can 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.830
 to be exploited with a certain profit 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.540
 for what concerns me with a good one 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.370
 alcohol reserve can be exploited 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.530
 this simple stove during a 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.630
 adventure in the woods where it is not 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.060
 allowed to light a fire or can 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.950
 come in handy in emergency situations 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.900
 like the ones I described in the movie 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.900
 on the winter car kit 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.100
 that's all thank you for 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.510
 attention to the machines sent for 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.860
 the suggestions and criticisms I give you 

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.860
 appointment to an upcoming video
