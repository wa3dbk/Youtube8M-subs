00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.900
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.090
 are mounting tv and today we will talk about such 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.210
 great car of course 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.790
 surely this lav 300 fighter 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.829
 tanks on the wheelbase and so what's this 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.870
 I liked the car so much and 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.450
 why don't I even say that I am her 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.790
 I will scold today, but because she 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.130
 imba is actually in straight arms she 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.989
 bends all that just moves well 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.239
 if something is not moving in principle it 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.460
 can also straighten just say 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.469
 the most important where he is and everything 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.840
 we will do the rest for you 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.970
 it says generally there is a shop only 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.610
 several flaws are the most important and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.830
 the first flaw is your crooked hands 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.990
 if your hands are right this 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.560
 there is no shortage and the car will be still 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.900
 stronger 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.850
 if there is, then it is this disadvantage rather 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 all pretty quickly try 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.409
 correct because krivoruky it does not 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 suffers for no armor here but there is 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.369
 good speed fly somewhere and 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.159
 from there no longer leave you can 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.170
 quite so be careful and think 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.570
 before you fly somewhere on your 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.850
 speed and of course the angles 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.220
 vertical pickup which is not down 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.250
 guns lean almost well in no way 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 Generally on this cons for the most part 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.850
 run out or maybe i just have them 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.430
 I forget on the background of the benefits of what is possible 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.049
 attributed to the pluses of course the dynamics 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.299
 firstly the car is very good 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.150
 accelerates and secondly it just has 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.159
 the wildest speed is maximum one hundred four 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.070
 kilometer per hour tovakach by other perks and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.439
 more and more than 40 kilometers back 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.240
 per hour and this automatically means that 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.979
 we feel almost better than 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.310
 light tanks in our game 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.590
 and it is worth a lot further we can be 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.780
 Of course, where we are needed and at the same time 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.150
 weigh out all who are not handy 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.959
 we have a 90 millimeter cannon with 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.660
 recharge in 3.95 seconds is very 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 cool it is very fast with us 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.900
 one-time damage when 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.090
 stand still we turn on our 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.340
 tank destroyer skill which 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.340
 adds plus 15 percent damage and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.730
 the damage we have crashes 400 450 units 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 every 4 seconds dpm is just 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.190
 incredibly wild at the same time can fly 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.650
 alpha and more and it certainly pleases 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.799
 while breaking through is enough to sew 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.780
 About b t in the lower armor plates and all sorts of t-60 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.450
 twos right in the forehead no matter where 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.060
 sometimes it turns out to break even into the tower 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.069
 if not then yes we will of course 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.440
 shoot land mines and even land mines 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.200
 do serious damage without breaking through 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.959
 80 units with approximately a break through will be 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.099
 full from generally speaking gun 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.750
 wonderful here 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.250
 she is very accurate and with good 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.709
 stabilization with the wildest 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.410
 rate of fire with good penetration and 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.810
 good one-time damage so foot 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.329
 need to be afraid and if you got up somewhere 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.239
 you can just tune bye d and 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.160
 endure everything that moves and does not move 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.620
 further passing yes of course we have armor 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.380
 no armor there is no completely substituted 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.940
 not worth it and inconvenience delivers 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.680
 wheelbase 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.630
 if you are not used to it if you are up 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.849
 This ride only on machines on 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.250
 track base then you first 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.220
 suffer a little for behavior 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.769
 cars are a little different than 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.109
 tracked analogs but you get used I 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.480
 I assure you and then everything will go just 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.280
 wonderful sometimes of course cannon 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.230
 annoying she seems to be accurate and but 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.060
 there are some annoying ricochets and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.220
 non-penetration because the shell left a little 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.560
 left a little to the right and also very much 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.660
 straining how the car crashes on 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.389
 earth because of our speed we are very 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.280
 well we can fly up and belly then 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.870
 collect land and lose 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.879
 quite a large amount of hp 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.370
 so with this one must of course be 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.169
 more careful and by the way seemingly dimensions 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.940
 the car is not small not substituted 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.820
 worth it but invisibility on 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.949
 pretty good level 0 25 as far as 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.079
 I remember our stealth coefficient and 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.360
 it allows us not to shine if we 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.310
 standing somewhere in a nook well 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.800
 proper tactics of the game on the fighter 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.930
 the tanks are pretty simple we ourselves are big 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.409
 cardboard so we do not climb and not 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.389
 we shine we shoot 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.429
 one lines accuracy of the instrument allows 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.349
 until we just make out everything and everything. 

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:39.239
 left and right must move 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.179
 use our speed of more than 100 

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:44.909
 kilometers per hour and driving so just 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:47.009
 wind in the ears whistles in general machine in 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.919
 Overall , she has a wonderful 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.169
 small flaws but this is of course 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.169
 depends on the body whether you feel them 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.330
 whether or not I am personally in big situations 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.949
 most no longer felt that 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.469
 guns don't fall just found 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.479
 positions where the declination angles of the gun down 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.489
 not so necessary but up it rises 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.679
 by the way wonderful one more sweet 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:09.149
 feature of this unit and just you 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.679
 look chef there we are his pkd 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:12.449
 let's shoot because because he 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:13.019
 bum once one we put him three 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.509
 patron 

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.669
 Well here of course we have not yet seen 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.979
 but in general, the machine allows sometimes 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.379
 play very brazen we have a thousand 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.939
 three hundred and sixty-six units of strength 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.369
 it does not say that of course at all 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.919
 much but rather enough to 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:31.110
 to endure 23 hits while doing 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.699
 still stay alive so if you're in 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.919
 the end of the battle were left alone with 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.619
 any t-72 you can well 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.979
 it's easy to shoot him even 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:42.569
 duels with all sorts of t-64 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.849
 opponents below the level I do not speak 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.009
 In general, all sorts of opponents are higher on 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.319
 levels well what are they in the board and stern 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.869
 Wonderfully stitched yes even the bottom 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.240
 bronelist and have the same t-80 and leopards 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.579
 taken without problems and we owls and we 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.919
 six we are seven most importantly by ourselves 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:00.869
 do not climb on the rampage and then it will be possible 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.999
 actually live wonderful stuff 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:05.459
 sea ​​damage and enjoy life because 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.739
 car in the right hands very much 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:12.319
 they will be well what was my opinion with 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:12.319
 have you been gt yet see you yet
