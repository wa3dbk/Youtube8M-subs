about 28 29 degrees Celsius so um you
know<00:02:45.290> we're<00:02:45.530> rip<00:02:45.890> 21<00:02:46.520> leader<00:02:46.760> mark<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:47.270> well<00:02:47.450> so

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
know we're rip 21 leader mark as well so

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
know we're rip 21 leader mark as well so
I<00:02:47.720> can't<00:02:47.930> top<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.410> any<00:02:48.650> further<00:02:49.180> because

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I can't top it up any further because

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
I can't top it up any further because
the<00:02:50.780> batches<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.709> 21<00:02:52.070> litre<00:02:52.280> bitch<00:02:52.489> so<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.270> might

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the batches of 21 litre bitch so I might

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170 
the batches of 21 litre bitch so I might
set<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.770> outside<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.520> let<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.670> cool<00:02:55.910> down<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
set this outside and let it cool down a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.600 
set this outside and let it cool down a
bit<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:57.050> pitch<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.680> eastern<00:02:57.980> morning<00:02:58.310> man

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
bit and pitch the eastern morning man

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
bit and pitch the eastern morning man
that<00:02:58.970> I<00:03:02.410> haven't<00:03:03.410> really<00:03:03.620> bothered<00:03:03.980> making

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
that I haven't really bothered making

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.460 
that I haven't really bothered making
this<00:03:04.489> cider<00:03:04.880> because<00:03:05.120> I've<00:03:05.330> got<00:03:05.510> 10<00:03:05.840> grams<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
this cider because I've got 10 grams of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.949 
this cider because I've got 10 grams of
yeast<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:07.489> not<00:03:07.700> going<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.970> be<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> massive<00:03:08.750> a

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
yeast it's not going to be a massive a

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.220 
yeast it's not going to be a massive a
dvd-r<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.860> I've<00:03:10.580> basically<00:03:10.790> been<00:03:11.180> done<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
dvd-r and I've basically been done the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:31.080 
dvd-r and I've basically been done the
mats<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.769> bismuth<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:16.180> we<00:03:17.180> got<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:18.200> PPP

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.060 

so<00:03:32.090> basically<00:03:32.540> my<00:03:32.780> young<00:03:35.350> measured<00:03:36.350> original

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
so basically my young measured original

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.980 
so basically my young measured original
gravity<00:03:37.250> came<00:03:38.000> up<00:03:38.210> at<00:03:38.890> 1.05<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.210> and<00:03:41.210> best<00:03:41.810> with

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
gravity came up at 1.05 to and best with

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.640 
gravity came up at 1.05 to and best with
the<00:03:42.110> temperature<00:03:43.690> correction<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:45.290> it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the temperature correction because it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.180 
the temperature correction because it
you<00:03:45.830> know<00:03:45.950> there's<00:03:46.190> 28th<00:03:47.090> 29th<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:48.190> calculated

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
you know there's 28th 29th of calculated

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.830 
you know there's 28th 29th of calculated
the<00:03:49.340> correctional<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:49.970> temperature<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.690> give

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the correctional and temperature to give

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.370 
the correctional and temperature to give
the<00:03:51.080> correct<00:03:52.270> specific<00:03:53.270> gravity<00:03:53.660> which<00:03:54.200> is

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
the correct specific gravity which is

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.880 
the correct specific gravity which is
the<00:03:54.530> original<00:03:55.070> gravity<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.720> 1052<00:03:57.320> will

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
the original gravity and so 1052 will

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.150 
the original gravity and so 1052 will
give<00:03:58.070> us<00:03:58.300> potential<00:03:59.300> alcohol<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.290> maybe<00:04:00.620> six

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
give us potential alcohol of maybe six

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.520 
give us potential alcohol of maybe six
to<00:04:01.370> six<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> half<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.330> scene<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.380> I'm

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
to six and a half the scene so I'm

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.050 
to six and a half the scene so I'm
allowing<00:04:03.890> between<00:04:06.160> one<00:04:07.160> point<00:04:07.580> zero<00:04:07.760> zero

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
allowing between one point zero zero

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.260 
allowing between one point zero zero
five<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:09.160> 1.0<00:04:10.510> 10<00:04:11.680> as<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:13.070> final<00:04:13.640> gravity<00:04:13.820> so

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
five and 1.0 10 as the final gravity so

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.880 
five and 1.0 10 as the final gravity so
I<00:04:14.300> don't<00:04:14.540> know<00:04:14.630> expecting<00:04:15.410> something<00:04:15.620> around

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
I don't know expecting something around

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.820 
I don't know expecting something around
there<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.540> if<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> case<00:04:18.049> then<00:04:18.230> yes<00:04:18.590> so

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
there and if that's the case then yes so

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.949 
there and if that's the case then yes so
six<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> half<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.670> the<00:04:19.730> scene<00:04:19.910> alcohol<00:04:20.239> so

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
six and a half of the scene alcohol so

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.730 
six and a half of the scene alcohol so
it<00:04:21.260> should<00:04:21.440> be<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:23.480> know<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> good<00:04:23.870> veg<00:04:24.110> should

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
it should be you know a good veg should

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.980 
it should be you know a good veg should

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
original gravity of 1058 so not too far

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.690

views and estimated the ABV at 5.9 I
think<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.530> think<00:04:55.130> we've<00:04:55.280> pretty<00:04:55.490> much<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.970> track

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
think I think we've pretty much on track

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.940 
think I think we've pretty much on track
and<00:04:56.660> I<00:05:00.070> was<00:05:01.070> just<00:05:01.100> thinking<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.610> color<00:05:01.850> but

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
and I was just thinking the color but

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.380 
and I was just thinking the color but
the<00:05:03.950> Keller<00:05:04.190> was<00:05:04.370> off<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.700> chart<00:05:04.970> because<00:05:05.300> I

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
the Keller was off the chart because I

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.620 
the Keller was off the chart because I
seat<00:05:05.600> it<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.960> an<00:05:06.080> American<00:05:06.200> IPA<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:08.360> get<00:05:08.510> it

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
seat it to an American IPA and to get it

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.050 
seat it to an American IPA and to get it
as<00:05:08.750> close<00:05:08.930> i<00:05:09.200> could<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.740> but<00:05:10.610> i<00:05:10.640> didn't<00:05:10.910> see<00:05:11.030> a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
as close i could and but i didn't see a

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.330 
as close i could and but i didn't see a
cascadian<00:05:11.750> dark<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.200> little<00:05:12.230> black<00:05:12.740> IPA<00:05:13.160> in

cascadian dark a little black IPA in
bismuth<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.060> i<00:05:14.120> don't<00:05:14.300> know<00:05:14.360> whether<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:14.750> an

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
bismuth so i don't know whether it's an

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.830 
bismuth so i don't know whether it's an
add-on<00:05:15.200> or<00:05:15.530> not<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:16.490> but<00:05:16.700> ya<00:05:16.820> know<00:05:17.180> we're<00:05:17.720> all

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
add-on or not and but ya know we're all

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.100 
add-on or not and but ya know we're all
set<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.200> go<00:05:18.350> on<00:05:18.640> so<00:05:19.640> um<00:05:19.940> thanks<00:05:20.630> for<00:05:20.690> joining<00:05:20.990> me

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
set to go on so um thanks for joining me

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.600 
set to go on so um thanks for joining me
and<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.080> haven't<00:05:24.290> put<00:05:24.500> many<00:05:24.710> videos<00:05:25.370> up

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
and so I haven't put many videos up

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.770 
and so I haven't put many videos up
lately<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.330> I'm

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
lately and I'm

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.810 
lately and I'm
any<00:05:26.960> hungry<00:05:27.350> wind<00:05:27.560> stairs<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:28.070> kind<00:05:28.730> of
