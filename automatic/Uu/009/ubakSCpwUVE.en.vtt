00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.900
 very good and welcome to andrew in 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.760
 this week from a new sandro we are going to 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 can see a lot of content in 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.170
 filtration that has been reaching us so much 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.599
 of devices like the one plus you like 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.279
 from 15 we also received images 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.230
 of the motor or motorcycle x of third 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.089
 generation and some leaks 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.710
 also of the motor the motorcycle head that 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.480
 practically we already know everything 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.609
 we also wanted to tell you about a 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.739
 very important news and that is that the channel 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.510
 from youtube android this channel that you are 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.219
 seeing right now was looking 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.289
 collaborator to help follow 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.910
 uploading content daily and try 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.420
 maintain a minimum quality 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.429
 videos 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.620
 Well, that collaborator has already been 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.510
 found and we have to say that he has not 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.399
 been easy due to the amount of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.109
 requests in fact have been more than a thousand 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.550
 requests from people who were 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.739
 interested in collaborating with this 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.140
 the chosen project has been neutral and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.789
 another application channel to leader that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.829
 you can find in the link of the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.750
 description of the video and that by the way 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.850
 I'm going to tell you that it's my channel that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.340
 have commented or if it was a third 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.049
 but you can take a look at me 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.430
 I think you're going to like the content is 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.229
 completely different from what you are going to 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
 find here on android tube is a 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.190
 not so varied content you will not see 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.229
 so many reviews and so many analyzes of 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.819
 device maker but yes that 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.560
 let's focus a bit on what 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.420
 would be the applications and we're going to 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 analyze each of them in depth 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.130
 see how it works with that said 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.929
 let's start with the leaks the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 first would be the one plus tube a 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.979
 device that as we see aesthetically 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.319
 keeps more or less the line that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.180
 we could find in his predecessor but 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.980
 yes let's see a couple of differences 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540
 The first and most important is that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.820
 incorporates a physical button in the part 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.740
 front samsung style that makes us 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.810
 think that the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.130
 fingerprint sensor the second 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.170
 we would find it in the back 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.360
 where we would see that the camera happens to 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.010
 be a little more centered something that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.510
 aesthetically it looks better but that 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.880
 we do not know about its functionality either 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.590
 we also have to tell you that touch 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 will remain rough something that already 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.920
 we saw in the one plus map and that from 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.720
 here we believe that it is a very good 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190
 choice as to their 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.039
 specifications are already enough 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.770
 known we will have a snapdragon 810 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.110
 as processor 1 is with 4 gb of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.230
 RAM memory and for the GPU a 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.390
 adreno 430 internal storage 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.270
 will be 32 gigs and as for the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.750
 screen would keep the 5.5 inches but 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.290
 that yes with a resolution that h of 1440 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.450
 x 2560 to this we would have to add a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 posterior chamber precede pixel and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.620
 a front camera of 8 also 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
 we would have a 3300 battery 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.970
 milliamps and as a novelty we 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.200
 we would find the usb-type usb 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.910
 reversible 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 now we leave with the leaks of the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.349
 galaxy no 5 and how can we see in these 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.810
 images the aesthetic also follows the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.280
 line of note 4 but we will be able to see 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.769
 that the difference in what the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.690
 screen is curved on the sides something 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.030
 similar to galaxy eight but not so 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.610
 pronounced and from here it seems to me that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.230
 is a success since in every 6 with the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.519
 speed curves for example to me not 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.950
 I ended up convincing though 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.930
 aesthetically it was very beautiful but the one 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.640
 I had the screen so curved to me 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.860
 for example I did not like to hold the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.599
 phone in nou 5 we will see that it 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.430
 incorporates in the curves but of a 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.140
 way more subtle I think that 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.510
 all this is a matter of marketing and 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.000
 that the samsung galaxy s 6 ex had 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.920
 very much hype with the theme of the curve and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.690
 that in the end in any analysis that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.610
 you saw you realized that the curve does not 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.489
 it served nothing for nothing but something 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.170
 aesthetic so if with the nou 5 believe 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.930
 that can do the same and also to 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.879
 aesthetic level is very beautiful 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.980
 everyone has their weapons and samsung has 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.019
 decided that the curved screen is a 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.180
 of them in terms of their verifications 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.890
 we have nothing confirmed but 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.189
 we will have indications that they would be 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.879
 next the screen would be a 5 67 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:57.079
 inches superamoled with resolution 2560 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:00.139
 x 1440 resolution 4 hp we will have the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.650
 support for s &amp; p that could come out alone and 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:06.950
 would mount a samsung exynos processor 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.870
 7.433 of 8 cores to 64 bits of the gpu 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.329
 we do not have information but yes 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.060
 we know the ram memory that will be 4 GB 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.099
 of the kind of reading of 4 we will have 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.389
 wireless charging and we can find 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.630
 the device in four colors 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.759
 different black white gold and silver 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.800
 in addition to a glass back panel 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.990
 as we can see and like all 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.449
 years the naut family incorporates the latest 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.979
 in specifications and we trust that 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.810
 all this information becomes reality and 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.560
 we can enjoy the one that probably 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.360
 be the best device of this 2015 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.190
 as for Motorola this week 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.410
 we have had a lot of information about 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.840
 all the engine or the motorcycle but the motor 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.910
 or the motorcycle x these images come to us in 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.980
 which we can include a very 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.780
 subtle either in the back that 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 we see that it has a touch like that between 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.910
 silky and rough which makes it foresee that 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.260
 they will feel very good at hand too 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.600
 we can see that the speakers are still 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.430
 located on the same site something that I think 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.290
 that is quite successful but that 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.850
 keep maintaining these crevices that 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.919
 they do is filled with powder 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.419
 Over the days I think that this 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.919
 They could have worked a little better 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.830
 and have learned from the mistakes of 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.090
 motor or motorcycle of 2014 in terms of 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.430
 hardware the truth that we do not have 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.370
 official information but it is assumed that 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.470
 will have a hd screen of 5.7 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.470
 inches that processed will be the 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.810
 snapdragon 810 its second version at 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.060
 same as the one plus two that will count 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.040
 with 3 gigs of ram memory and that the 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.160
 storage will start from 32 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.169
 gigas for the rear camera will mount 16 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.720
 megapixels and that will be put up for sale 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.520
 with android 5.1.1 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.050
 of the engine of the moto cree of third 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.140
 generation we have been hearing rumors 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.090
 many weeks even months and in 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.850
 this video that came out a couple of days ago 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.110
 they officially explain everything to us 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.840
 we will have a screen of 5 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.940
 inch with resolution hd the processor 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.720
 it will be a quad with the most possible is that 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.760
 be snapdragon 410 the connection will be 4g 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.470
 lte and we will also have dual sim 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.770
 we will have a long battery 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.500
 although it does not specify 2 milliamps 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.480
 we will have android lollipop 5.1 and 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.870
 we will also have water resistance 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.700
 with ip x 7 submersible certification 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.280
 for 30 minutes up to one meter 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.650
 depth the rear camera will be at 13 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.110
 megapixels with double led flash and the 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.880
 5 megapixel front camera will be 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.340
 obviously compatible with cards 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.169
 microsd and we will have a lot of 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.790
 customization thanks to the caps 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.650
 backs that we can change by 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.270
 different colors the only thing that does not 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.550
 we have clear is still the memory 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.320
 rancidity of 1 on 2 gb and if the 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.270
 internal storage will begin in 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.920
 8 or 16 GB 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.810
 and good until here the 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.460
 news I think we 've talked about 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.320
 the most important leaks that 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.070
 we have had this week whether those of 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.150
 one plus 15 motor of the motorcycle x seems to me 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.340
 that is going to be one of the best 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.990
 devices this year and the engine or the 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.300
 motorcycle gp as we are seeing already 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.880
 we practically know everything and that will be 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.530
 announced on July 28 this month so 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.480
 that nothing if you liked the android of 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.070
 this week do not forget to leave your like 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.770
 enough for my channel to see more 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:14.450
 Android application content and without 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.450
 bad see you in the next video
