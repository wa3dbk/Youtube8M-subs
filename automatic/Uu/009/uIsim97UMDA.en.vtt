00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 pleasure simply because I do not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 understand nothing and I am someone who 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.879
 is yet at the base is enough 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
 sensitive 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.379

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:25.440
