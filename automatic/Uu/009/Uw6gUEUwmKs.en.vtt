 interesting that good close many 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.300
 they will be interested because it has to do with 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.029
 little things of the generation of worlds and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.169
 good here in this video there are no images 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.300
 well of the game 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.580
 or ingame images of steel point 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.439
 serious but we have a few tweets 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
 quite interesting enough that good 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.860
 they already bring us a very good information 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.570
 in this video we are going to talk about what 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 what are the strongholds and what are the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.350
 size of the worlds good here are 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.850
 pure tweets from jay and good we're going to 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.790
 start with this first tweet that says 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.360
 good today today meets some socks 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.970
 colorful that's x do not put it tomorrow 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.619
 I'll start in the morning finally 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.809
 start deporting them stronghold 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:58.239
 minecraft and so is tomorrow going to start 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.439
 this if you say how good it gives me 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.869
 understand that there was notorious is missing a 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.489
 little minecraft and to get out the beta or 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:06.010
 even obviously obviously the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.290
 official update but obviously 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.570
 sales also jumps a lot because if 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
 this what just tomorrow will start 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.470
 is that good still lacks enough 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.090
 Little things there is a bit of bad 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.560
 news but good you see that it is 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.899
 working hard guys 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.060
 and good a very 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.610
 very very good so let's go to the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.680
 second image and says regarding the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.320
 previous tuit says that the stronghold 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.939
 they will be difficult to find because they do not 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.250
 there are enher eyes as you know on the pc 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.619
 to find the stronghold with one eye 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.409
 to sell it open and eyes from where 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.030
 they begin to guide they make a way in 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.100
 the sky and it's going on you're throwing 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.960
 until they start to go down for the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.369
 I step on the eyes of ender and well there it is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.679
 where you have to chop down to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.509
 find the stronghold as well as it's like 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.789
 you saw here in minecraft and it's going to be 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.619
 very hard to find the strong hall 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.060
 since there is no way to look for them 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.360
 fanning in the eyes of ender 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.220
 good the good ones and the pearls where more 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.560
 well they are the ones that are painted but good 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.240
 says that if there is going to be this, if they are going to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 be the minecraft reds and in some 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.649
 place in the world but the big glove goes to 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.880
 be incredibly especially one like that 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.500
 what good if someday when they are made 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.360
 I play game I'll be a video 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.590
 special not so good we went to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.900
 next tweet also with respect to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.370
 write move up this 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.349
 same twitter that are going to be difficult 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.610
 find and that and then he asks 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.080
 brody but the worlds are going to be 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.910
 extremely small so we 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.100
 They make it possible to find eventually or 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.769
 be quickly but good this brody what 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.390
 who did not realize is that good not 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.190
 is aware of the class news or 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.350
 point 9 points and steal worlds come 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.860
 infinities in parentheses because a 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.830
 then explain something very this then 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.260
 something detail something important not so 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.530
 good more than anything to see where it is that 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.170
 the 0.9 the ones are going to be very long not 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.620
 infinite infinities 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.140
 but very long as you know I started the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.819
 worlds are not infinite ok 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.610
 Many people believe it but the worlds 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.050
 they are not infinite I started now for 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.130
 continue with this we move on to the next 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.140
 tweet 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.410
 this same tweet and question there is forgiveness 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 sorry and says the same thing they're going to be 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.530
 hard to find but good they are going to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590
 be in a place then the same question 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.330
 the answer and then I asked him I had 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 off off set I had him ask 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.170
 infinite you mean fun law right 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.060
 says with the infinities you mean the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.409
 PC version or you mean the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.930
 PC size true as you know I started 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.599
 the ones are at least 30 million a 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 more 30 million that is to say the worlds 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.390
 then they go from 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.420
 x 0 and 0 on one side for 30 and 0 for 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.700
 less to minus 30 million and for more 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.740
 plus 30 million is to say that if the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.620
 we add the worlds after they are in total 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.200
 of large 60 million blocks 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.360
 everywhere if we stop, let's say 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.580
 that in the 0 0 source block there is no 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.590
 that's that's what it says I do not have 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.330
 the exact numbers but I started those 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.390
 numbers are from 30 million to plus 30 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.160
 millions but in minecraft are going to be 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.800
 minors ok 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.019
 here comes the important news 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.090
 the infinite worlds as I said between 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.550
 parentheses between quotes of PC's 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.070
 minecraft infinite forgiveness are not going to 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.200
 do not even the size of those of 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.190
 pc but well this is very good since 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.690
 obviously I do not think a device 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.790
 Laptop would still be able to withstand 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.730
 these worlds but good we already have 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.020
 worlds of which are less 10,000 me 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.750
 it seems that this makes the world bigger 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.940
 then we put Infinite in nine 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.130
 crespi that will be less than 10,000 to 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.350
 plus 10 thousand blocks ie the worlds 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.540
 of minecraft and infinities are going to be 20 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.510
 a thousand blocks big obviously this is 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.100
 very much so do not worry guys 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.280
 it's very, very serious, you can not imagine it 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.230
 but hey it will be very very great not 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.630
 I know how I'm going to make them farlan is also 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.040
 bring a video if you do not know what the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.680
 Good streetlamps are how they end up 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.390
 worlds inhabit crespi invisible space 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.000
 I started well they are going to put a field of 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.550
 force and in xbox this is no river but 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.780
 good if yes to the news of the air 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.270
 guys so good here they already have it 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.530
 infinite worlds its exact size or what 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.800
 most likely this is its size 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.960
 well definitive since infinite they are going to 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.910
 be from less than 10 thousand to 10 thousand what is 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.570
 say 20 thousand blocks we did not even reach 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.850
 the 100 thousand or so that is not compared 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.320
 nothing to the pc world but it is very 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.110
 very big and a subject we are going to have 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.340
 very many chances to find 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.500
 things so good guys what you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.330
 have liked this video if they were zulay 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.520
 I want when they know utilization is spent 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.440
 air and me directly and good nothing we 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.160
 we have dared is because he liked and
