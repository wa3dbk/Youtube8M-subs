really to get the high-priced lawyers we

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
really to get the high-priced lawyers we
need<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.750> when<00:01:48.869> Nintendo

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
need to kind of do this so when Nintendo

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
need to kind of do this so when Nintendo
is<00:01:49.259> done<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.430> effort<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> try<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is done now is in an effort to try to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.450 
is done now is in an effort to try to
improve<00:01:51.570> their<00:01:52.079> relationship<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
improve their relationship and I think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
improve their relationship and I think
this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.210> insult<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> us

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
this is actually more of an insult to us

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.300 
this is actually more of an insult to us
than<00:01:54.930> anything<00:01:55.170> else<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.860> created<00:01:55.979> something

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
than anything else it created something

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.060

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.410 
biggest concern with this program just
overall<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.730> works<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.360> it

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
overall is that if it works and it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.870 
overall is that if it works and it
becomes<00:03:06.660> popular<00:03:07.050> more<00:03:07.950> gaming<00:03:08.280> companies

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
becomes popular more gaming companies

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.520 
becomes popular more gaming companies
and<00:03:09.239> other<00:03:09.390> companies<00:03:09.780> might<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.500> same

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and other companies might do the same

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
and other companies might do the same
thing<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> decide<00:03:11.520> you<00:03:11.670> know<00:03:11.790> what<00:03:11.820> we<00:03:12.450> can

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
thing and decide you know what we can

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.270 
thing and decide you know what we can
earn<00:03:12.870> money<00:03:13.170> even<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.560> they<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.100> fair

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.370 
reviewers independent work as their own
and<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:44.940> keep<00:03:45.450> most<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> revenue<00:03:46.350> that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and then keep most of the revenue that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.590 
and then keep most of the revenue that
that<00:03:46.650> person<00:03:47.100> should<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.760> been<00:03:47.910> earning<00:03:48.180> for

that person should have been earning for

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870 
that person should have been earning for
the<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.440> journalistic<00:03:50.370> effort<00:03:50.730> they're

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the the journalistic effort they're

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.699 
the the journalistic effort they're
contributing<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.959> world<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.410> i<00:03:52.470> think

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
contributing to the world and i think

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
contributing to the world and i think
that<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.010> wrong<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.580> i<00:03:53.790> thought<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.239> lot<00:03:54.420> about

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that is wrong so i thought a lot about

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.150 
that is wrong so i thought a lot about
this<00:03:54.900> i<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.110> thinking<00:03:55.350> about<00:03:55.500> signing<00:03:55.709> up<00:03:55.920> for

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
this i was thinking about signing up for

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.050 
this i was thinking about signing up for
it<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.340> starting<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.640> do<00:03:56.700> some<00:03:56.730> more<00:03:56.910> in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it and starting to do some more in

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.610 
it and starting to do some more in
intended<00:03:57.420> reviews<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:57.900> after<00:03:58.140> i<00:03:58.170> slept<00:03:58.500> on

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
intended reviews but after i slept on

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.750 
intended reviews but after i slept on
and<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.860> kind<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.040> went<00:03:59.220> back<00:03:59.459> through<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
and it kind of went back through the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.490 
and it kind of went back through the
fine<00:03:59.940> print<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.720> isn't<00:04:01.049> good<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.260> is

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
fine print this isn't good this is

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.190 
fine print this isn't good this is
really<00:04:01.950> putting<00:04:02.519> fair<00:04:02.970> use<00:04:03.299> at<00:04:03.510> risk<00:04:03.900> i<00:04:04.019> think

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
really putting fair use at risk i think

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.289 
really putting fair use at risk i think
it<00:04:04.260> puts<00:04:04.410> journalism<00:04:05.130> at<00:04:05.250> risk<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.700> certain

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
it puts journalism at risk to a certain

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.699 
it puts journalism at risk to a certain
degree<00:04:06.330> especially<00:04:06.720> journalists<00:04:07.470> who<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.590> on

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
going to be a disaster for them don't

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.940 
going to be a disaster for them don't
even<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.229> how<00:04:22.289> they<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.500> have<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.680> labor

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
even know how they can have the labor

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.290 
even know how they can have the labor
force<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.490> keep<00:04:23.729> up<00:04:23.880> with<00:04:24.060> all<00:04:24.090> this

monitoring and reviewing and everything

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.650 
monitoring and reviewing and everything
I<00:04:26.039> think<00:04:26.370> what<00:04:26.640> they<00:04:26.729> should<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.150> is

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
I think what they should do is

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.180 
I think what they should do is
did<00:04:27.750> what<00:04:27.870> any<00:04:28.020> good<00:04:28.110> company<00:04:28.680> would<00:04:28.920> and

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
did what any good company would and

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.760 
did what any good company would and
really<00:04:29.910> respect<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.510> right<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.810> journalists

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
really respect the right of journalists
