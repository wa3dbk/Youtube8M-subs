00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 because I do not like it very well 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.190
 this is not going to comment 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.420
 I do not fall in greece all the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.480
 things that humans do 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.320
 to transform to appear in the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
 that are not 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 but look at this one that has appeared 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.400
 new technique says that always good to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 often we show people who want 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.760
 It seems good also to men because 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
 remember one that should look like 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 superman and they saw lots of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.949
 surgeries also showed women who 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.010
 they want to look like the barbie they are 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.920
 in many surgeries before it was in the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.469
 90 the famous when wanting to reach as 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 ideal model 90 60 90 following 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 being for many women but this that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 came now and that is thought of in a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 barcelona clinic and that is is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 applying is really amazing and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 transcends everything one can 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 imagine is a laser that lightens the color 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.420
 of the eyes if you want to have the eyes 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 clear, you no longer have to resort to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 photoshop in some photos or to the lenses of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.910
 contact of colors are over 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 contact lenses colored at least in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 europe in barcelona because that clinic 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 only what is your 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 treatments but many women 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.530
 damage to changing the color of eyes 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.060
 It is irreversible if you have brown eyes 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.710
 of the clarify that they put them green in 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.079
 hotels but that's how they are for Asia 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 no collateral risks is what 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.119
 ensures the clinic so it's called six 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.609
 echoes and the treatment is called new age 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 new eyes are five sessions of 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.380
 laser application and cost two thousand 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.599
 euros the treatment so that if you were born 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.229
 with dark brown eyes and you do not like them 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:39.739
 they can be formed on clear shoulders a 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.739
 a madness and a turn 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 amazing really close 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.950
 and really unworthy because there are times 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 if you listen it is very typical for the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 draw a parallel maybe a little 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 forced but many times when they are born 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 baby is one of the questions that you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.590
 makes people open their eyes and what 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.390
 color have eyes and spread because 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.400
 Gentilism both color values 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 eyes that a person has if in 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.780
 definitive is what matters least the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 eye color the person has 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.040
 question people who call the attention that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.170
 just a child is born who are to ask 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.360
 and what eye color and it's like it's 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 that clear eyes 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 they get more for saying it in Creole and yes and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.930
 if they are not, well, of course, 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 Example mom or dad has two 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 clear but it tells you any grief 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.080
 because what do you punish with your eyes that what 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.060
 we see life there are initial people is equal 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.100
 that they have no view that they are blind 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.140
 they do not have eyes in Cordoba there is a case of 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100
 a child who does not have eyeballs 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.720
 then why wonder what 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.400
 color has the eyes the babies people 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.230
 that as I do not know how to really want 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.000
 changing the color of the eyes is something 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.000
 that does not exceed 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.500
 I wanted to study then exactly 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 good
