00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 This beautiful spring sun gives 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 me the opportunity and especially the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.480
 Lighting around you the details of my 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 drive times to show that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.610
 Here you are pretty much 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.990
 unkempt of the koran evolution the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.310
 Vehicle care became something 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.199
 neglected because I last 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 weeks and months only if the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 drive for the green that switched 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:31.890
 you can already guess that because somehow 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 more in it than you are used to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 I hope the light and shadow play 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.329
 confused that now not too much 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 actually a relatively simple one 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.379
 history from the bottom bracket goes on 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.710
 the left crank a freewheeling which one 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.379
 Rüttgers can step on a chain 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.550
 The chain has a 24 thirds here with 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 a sixteen secured as a skilful 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.460
 as counter nut 24 on 16 teeth there 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.129
 So below there is a cast of 1 to 1 5 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 or 3 to 2 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 that means with the poor I do 75 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 turns when I'm with the two 100 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 do and that actually feels whole 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.920
 good at because with the poor by not so 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.750
 rum yodel like us legs to since here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.689
 is again a normal bottom bracket tube 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 a simple telescopic mast so two 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.140
 telescoped four end pipes with 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 a support down here again 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 that's the force up one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.860
 bit support 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.869
 and rear main 25 grams heavier 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.229
 phone holder where the quiet the smartphone 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.259
 can clasp mirror bracket of 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.970
 those of the bush &amp; müller reflect the 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.540
 I had left but clamp bracket 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.549
 with a cabbage and camera universal 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.090
 clicks bracket and yogi tripod 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.380
 leave the cranks 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.759
 she has to weld herself now 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.020
 because they have no disability with me 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.119
 with the width here in the vehicle 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 where else can you get here 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.560
 Side problem I have so me 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.929
 The existing trial crank up the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.550
 for this the grätzl had 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.420
 taken and cut off flat 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.250
 make that is now 150 he made 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.800
 think they are now at 150 or even 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.030
 130 do not even need to go there 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.530
 I have 150 and 145 as 165 times 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.100
 Tried and tested can be different 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.690
 yes and then here are the handlebars 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.519
 tuned 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.310
 that are pretty stiff because they are 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.700
 high powers and pull and push 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.579
 have to endure 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.530
 poor on this lever and they are 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:43.840
 rotatable and about this turntable here 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.000
 in front this divorce becomes the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.750
 suspended tree trains pulls the once 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.750
 left one right 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.710
 the country is not going to do it now 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.940
 too little in one hand that is one 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.860
 a little bit so common with one 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.120
 Hand this back a bit hard 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.870
 really needs both hands and the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 start is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.100
 but that then leads to it being done 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.340
 strong but that's the way it is 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.720
 principle knows recognizable on the left hand 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.570
 then I still have the knowledge 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.030
 meters turn it on with the one very 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.860
 practically very nice switch down 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.940
 can be good and then comes on the stop 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.790
 places with the trains 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.300
 Two handlebars in the city train to one 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.580
 the central quietly tighten the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.970
 then stretch easily accessible places 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
 can 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:42.740
 this bow makes you this whole 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.240
 movement is at the right grip of the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.620
 right is already designed differently he 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.730
 is no longer the handle of such a 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.710
 bit disturbing in between the fingers 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.660
 but so im on the handle that I the 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:58.070
 fully grasp and pull the brake lever 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:01.850
 can and up here are still left yes 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.190
 but the cable again so brake cable and 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.760
 also the electric cable opposite such a 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.260
 big bow coupling leaving nothing 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.800
 collides and grinds and also here 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.410
 again the arrangement savers and 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.390
 then it gets a bit more complicated 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.049
 then I go all those distracting trains 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.940
 down there on the former telephotos 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.150
 is again a disc with 1 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.530
 Turned minutes were trains in it 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.450
 and in the back they are over one 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.070
 screwed clamped I have 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.020
 not yet distracted because I still 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.790
 because of forgiven if numbers that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.400
 That's why publishers are also hanging 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.610
 a bit chaotic up there and 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.140
 because you had so much space here 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.430
 I have behind the handlebars the brake 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.280
 installed and that are the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.260
 but it's hard to recognize the bottom ones 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.310
 pull those little ones in the small bow 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.370
 walk down the chain down here 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.470
 These are the drum brakes 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.420
 served here on the old settings 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.980
 have finished this and then this comes 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.160
 Brake truck magnet for the rhön 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.470
 Brake light switch is on it and the 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:19.060
 Brake ways has the effect that they are the 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:20.950
 force uniformity both distributed and 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.080
 Sun sees the look of brake problems 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.370
 Too Cramped Red Died Traveling means that's me 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:31.090
 can not go now it still has to 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:32.280
 repair well knowing yes and that is 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.420
 actually everything 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.550
 I have the circuit for the front 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.650
 demand sit here just once 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.710
 made that you have to go hand in hand 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.670
 Take away you can switch here 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.860
 so rich first 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.220
 I also have emergency brake lever here 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.990
 built in between my legs misrata 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.190
 it is good that this is the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.930
 Notbrems lever was the straight 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.490
 failed is in the stand yes I can 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.530
 because I can slow down a bit more because 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.640
 The train attacked away from these braking 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.550
 does not work as I the 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.810
 Here he only makes ten 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.910
 millimeter away if I have a whole 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.680
 go through that is not enough 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.240
 Here you can see in 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.620
 steering to the triathlon are the 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.300
 usually kinked there you can 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.000
 more heat target 15 mm 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.500
 I still have the travel agent 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.840
 ordered that I still the zugweg 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.490
 increase what I can brake fully 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.770
 Now I have to repair first 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:29.039
 I 've even come home Yes 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:31.389
 the whole thing is sitting in here 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.720
 to enter is a bit like 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.280
 is up and slipped by is not 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.160
 just more comfortable and big but it 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.570
 At the time I worked in the last one 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.389
 video and penultimate ever shown 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.710
 I think because I had so much time 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.110
 and I still have to do it fast 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.289
 also the electrics redone and here 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.840
 a key switch built in and 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:58.410
 Illuminated fans had come 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.539
 usb here too 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.099
 two USB ports to the phone too 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.389
 load 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:09.720
 while driving so slowly it is then 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.720
 also full
