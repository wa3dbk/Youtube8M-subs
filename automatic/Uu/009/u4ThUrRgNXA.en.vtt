okay<00:00:07.120> well<00:00:07.359> I<00:00:07.390> got<00:00:07.660> this<00:00:08.099> all<00:00:09.099> the<00:00:10.080> ceiling

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
okay well I got this all the ceiling

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.069 
okay well I got this all the ceiling
panels<00:00:11.500> out<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:12.309> diffused<00:00:12.820> panels<00:00:13.780> and

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:14.079 
panels out the diffused panels and

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.609 
panels out the diffused panels and
here's<00:00:14.829> one<00:00:15.190> of<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.369> reasons<00:00:15.789> why<00:00:16.380> the<00:00:17.380> light

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
here's one of the reasons why the light

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.470 
here's one of the reasons why the light
was<00:00:17.890> kind<00:00:18.130> of<00:00:18.250> dim<00:00:18.460> in<00:00:18.699> here<00:00:18.940> you<00:00:19.060> see<00:00:19.270> that

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
was kind of dim in here you see that

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.510 
was kind of dim in here you see that
here's<00:00:20.020> a<00:00:20.110> fluorescent<00:00:20.740> light<00:00:20.920> fixture<00:00:21.370> these

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
here's a fluorescent light fixture these

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.160 
here's a fluorescent light fixture these
are<00:00:21.640> 4-foot<00:00:22.150> fluorescent<00:00:22.780> tube<00:00:22.930> light

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
are 4-foot fluorescent tube light

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.100 
are 4-foot fluorescent tube light
fixtures<00:00:23.650> one<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.700> bulbs<00:00:25.480> has<00:00:25.810> either

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
fixtures one of the bulbs has either

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.520 
fixtures one of the bulbs has either
burned<00:00:26.410> out<00:00:26.620> or<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.610> light<00:00:27.880> ballast<00:00:28.480> needs<00:00:29.380> to

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
burned out or the light ballast needs to

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.590 
burned out or the light ballast needs to
be<00:00:29.650> replaced<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:30.280> if<00:00:30.370> you<00:00:30.520> ever<00:00:30.730> come<00:00:31.270> across

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
be replaced now if you ever come across

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.690 
be replaced now if you ever come across
this<00:00:31.870> if<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:32.230> got<00:00:32.439> some<00:00:33.070> fluorescent<00:00:33.340> light

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
this if you got some fluorescent light

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.190 
this if you got some fluorescent light
fixtures<00:00:34.059> like<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.390> in<00:00:34.539> your<00:00:34.660> garage<00:00:34.780> or

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
fixtures like this in your garage or

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.960 
fixtures like this in your garage or
something<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:35.680> let's<00:00:36.010> say<00:00:36.190> one<00:00:36.940> of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
something like that let's say one of

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.960 
something like that let's say one of
your<00:00:37.240> tubes<00:00:37.570> are<00:00:37.930> both<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.130> them<00:00:39.280> are<00:00:39.430> flashing

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
your tubes are both of them are flashing

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.880 
your tubes are both of them are flashing
well<00:00:40.150> one<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.510> them<00:00:40.630> could<00:00:40.870> still<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.350> good<00:00:41.590> and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
well one of them could still be good and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.920 
well one of them could still be good and
the<00:00:42.400> other<00:00:42.430> one<00:00:42.820> might<00:00:43.030> be<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:43.239> one<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.690> be

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
the other one might be the one to be

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.380 
the other one might be the one to be
needing<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.829> be<00:00:44.950> replaced<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.700> replace<00:00:46.060> one

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
needing to be replaced you replace one

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.940 
needing to be replaced you replace one
let's<00:00:46.780> say<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.020> doesn't<00:00:47.320> work<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:47.650> replace

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
let's say it doesn't work you replace

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.080 
let's say it doesn't work you replace
the<00:00:48.100> other<00:00:48.220> one<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.520> still<00:00:48.700> doesn't<00:00:48.940> work

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
the other one it still doesn't work

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.819 
the other one it still doesn't work
you're<00:00:49.630> thinking<00:00:49.840> what<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.050> heck<00:00:50.410> is<00:00:50.560> going

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
you're thinking what the heck is going

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.610 
you're thinking what the heck is going
on<00:00:50.950> well<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.340> might<00:00:51.579> be<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.620> electronic

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
on well it might be the electronic

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.510 
on well it might be the electronic
ballast<00:00:55.620> inside<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.770> light<00:00:56.950> fixture<00:00:57.370> and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
ballast inside the light fixture and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.030 
ballast inside the light fixture and
probably<00:00:58.329> they're<00:00:58.510> not<00:00:58.630> electronic<00:00:59.500> ones<00:00:59.710> in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
probably they're not electronic ones in

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.160 
probably they're not electronic ones in
the<00:01:00.160> old<00:01:00.340> days<00:01:00.579> they<00:01:01.300> were<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.510> different<00:01:02.050> one

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
the old days they were a different one

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.200 
the old days they were a different one
you<00:01:02.380> replace<00:01:03.040> that<00:01:03.250> with<00:01:03.430> an<00:01:03.579> electronic

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
you replace that with an electronic

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.609 
you replace that with an electronic
style<00:01:04.600> ballasts<00:01:05.049> they're<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.229> little<00:01:05.439> bit

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
style ballasts they're a little bit

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.319 
style ballasts they're a little bit
lighter<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.280> bit<00:01:06.460> easier<00:01:06.880> they<00:01:07.090> last

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
lighter a little bit easier they last

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.020 
lighter a little bit easier they last
longer<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:07.990> then<00:01:08.830> your<00:01:09.070> tubes<00:01:09.370> might<00:01:09.670> start

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
longer and then your tubes might start

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.510 
longer and then your tubes might start
working<00:01:10.479> another<00:01:11.260> thing<00:01:11.650> if<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.250> look<00:01:12.400> at

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
working another thing if you look at

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.539 
working another thing if you look at
these<00:01:12.640> light<00:01:12.970> tubes<00:01:13.950> we've<00:01:14.950> got<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.280> one

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
these light tubes we've got this one

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.380 
these light tubes we've got this one
light<00:01:15.790> tube<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.470> right<00:01:17.740> which<00:01:18.700> isn't<00:01:19.000> as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
light tube to the right which isn't as

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.990 
light tube to the right which isn't as
dark<00:01:19.780> see<00:01:20.200> how<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.409> one<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.400> left<00:01:21.490> is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
dark see how the one to the left is

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.539 
dark see how the one to the left is
discolored<00:01:22.900> at<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.440> end<00:01:23.619> about<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> last

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
discolored at the end about the last

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.240 
discolored at the end about the last
couple<00:01:25.030> inches<00:01:25.420> well<00:01:26.170> usually<00:01:26.470> that's<00:01:27.010> the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
couple inches well usually that's the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.910 
couple inches well usually that's the
one<00:01:27.460> that's<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.570> telltale<00:01:29.020> sign<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.799> one

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
one that's a telltale sign of the one

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680 
one that's a telltale sign of the one
that's<00:01:30.100> probably<00:01:30.369> burned<00:01:30.909> out<00:01:31.150> or<00:01:31.180> getting

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
that's probably burned out or getting

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.480 
that's probably burned out or getting
ready<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.140> be<00:01:32.260> burned<00:01:32.500> out<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.920> here's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
ready to be burned out and here's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.730 
ready to be burned out and here's
another<00:01:33.790> tip<00:01:34.090> for<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.450> if<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.110> replace<00:01:35.439> one

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
another tip for you if you replace one

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
another tip for you if you replace one
but<00:01:36.070> one<00:01:36.369> light<00:01:38.430> fluorescent<00:01:39.430> light<00:01:39.610> tube

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
but one light fluorescent light tube

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.140 
but one light fluorescent light tube
sometimes<00:01:41.439> it's<00:01:41.680> best<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.010> just<00:01:42.130> replace<00:01:42.580> both

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
sometimes it's best to just replace both

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.640 
sometimes it's best to just replace both
of<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.900> because<00:01:44.590> after<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.979> while<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:47.229> could

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
of them because after a while it could

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.310 
of them because after a while it could
have<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> tendency<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.790> burn<00:01:49.119> out<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.570> existing

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
have a tendency to burn out the existing

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.429 
have a tendency to burn out the existing
light<00:01:51.009> tube<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.460> still<00:01:51.700> working<00:01:51.939> okay<00:01:52.659> there's

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
light tube is still working okay there's

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.580 
light tube is still working okay there's
just<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.740> little<00:01:53.890> quick<00:01:54.220> dirty<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.590> fluorescent

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
just a little quick dirty on fluorescent

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.980 
just a little quick dirty on fluorescent
light<00:01:56.799> tubes<00:01:56.830> here's<00:01:57.520> see<00:01:58.150> here's<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.450> 4-footer

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
light tubes here's see here's a 4-footer

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.440 
light tubes here's see here's a 4-footer
that's<00:01:59.320> still<00:01:59.560> working<00:01:59.799> here's<00:02:00.280> one<00:02:00.549> at<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's still working here's one at the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.300 
that's still working here's one at the
end<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:02.020> not<00:02:02.200> working<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.100> ones

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
those are burned out and then they even

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.490 
those are burned out and then they even
did<00:02:06.100> something<00:02:07.000> nice<00:02:07.180> over<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.810> kitchen<00:02:08.200> sink

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
did something nice over the kitchen sink

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.180 
did something nice over the kitchen sink
they've<00:02:08.769> got<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.159> small<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:09.939> here<00:02:10.329> and<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
they've got a small one here and you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.550 
they've got a small one here and you
know<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:12.819> working<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:14.349> right

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
know but it's not working all right

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.470 
know but it's not working all right
but<00:02:15.370> even<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:15.849> these<00:02:16.000> were<00:02:16.060> working

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
but even if these were working

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.990 
but even if these were working
we<00:02:17.870> want<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.349> get<00:02:18.470> rid<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.310> stuff

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
we want it to get rid of all this stuff

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
we've got we've got see the Select this

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.490 
we've got we've got see the Select this
electrical<00:02:25.250> box<00:02:25.519> you<00:02:25.790> got<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.750> got<00:02:26.900> flexible

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
electrical box you got you got flexible

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.080 
electrical box you got you got flexible
conduit<00:02:28.010> coming<00:02:28.430> out<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.790> there<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.000> they

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
conduit coming out of there and they

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.759 
conduit coming out of there and they
just<00:02:29.269> use<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.569> as<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> junction<00:02:30.200> box<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.620> they

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
just use that as a junction box and they

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.509 
just use that as a junction box and they
and<00:02:30.980> they<00:02:31.550> Ram<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.650> flexible<00:02:34.190> wiring<00:02:35.120> cabling

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
and they Ram the flexible wiring cabling

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.860 
and they Ram the flexible wiring cabling
over<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.700> each<00:02:37.880> light<00:02:38.239> fixture<00:02:38.660> because<00:02:38.750> they

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
over to each light fixture because they

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.390 
over to each light fixture because they
don't<00:02:39.200> really<00:02:39.319> care<00:02:39.620> about<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:40.069> what's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
don't really care about that what's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.820 
don't really care about that what's
above<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.239> ceiling<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.380> didn't<00:02:42.680> see

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
above the ceiling and you didn't see

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.520 
above the ceiling and you didn't see
that<00:02:43.010> through<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> diffuse<00:02:43.819> panels<00:02:44.470> okay<00:02:45.470> so

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
that through the diffuse panels okay so

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.839 
that through the diffuse panels okay so
we're<00:02:45.769> gonna<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:46.099> we're<00:02:46.489> gonna<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.730> a

we're gonna have we're gonna have a

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.820 
we're gonna have we're gonna have a
little<00:02:47.000> electrical<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.900> here<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.470> man

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
little electrical to do here to man

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.560 
little electrical to do here to man
we've<00:02:49.160> got<00:02:49.310> all<00:02:49.459> kinds<00:02:49.849> of<00:02:50.080> things<00:02:51.080> going<00:02:51.200> on
