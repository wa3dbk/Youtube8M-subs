leg insert your hook knit wise and draw
up<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> loop<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
up a loop and now what you have is a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.799 
up a loop and now what you have is a
twisted<00:00:54.539> knit<00:00:54.930> stitch<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.730> made<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.239> twist

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
twisted knit stitch but we made it twist

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.670 
twisted knit stitch but we made it twist
to<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> right

to the right

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
to the right
so<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.250> right-leaning<00:01:00.270> twisted<00:01:00.930> knit

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.780 
so it's a right-leaning twisted knit
stitch<00:01:02.210> let's<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.539> again<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.640> let's<00:01:05.640> get
