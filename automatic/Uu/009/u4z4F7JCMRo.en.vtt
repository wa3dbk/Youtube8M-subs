faces come into this bubble packaging

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.479 
faces come into this bubble packaging
and<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:49.050> original<00:00:49.379> Sailor<00:00:49.860> Moon<00:00:50.010> release<00:00:50.250> did

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and the original Sailor Moon release did

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.220 
and the original Sailor Moon release did
this<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.210> believe<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.960> original

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
this and I believe the original

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
this and I believe the original
animation<00:00:52.829> color<00:00:53.190> did<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> feel<00:00:54.390> like

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
animation color did it and I feel like

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
animation color did it and I feel like
this<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.840> been<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> way<00:00:55.110> better<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:56.030> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this would have been a way better way to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.540 
this would have been a way better way to
keep<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.570> faces<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.530> storage<00:00:58.920> without<00:00:59.129> having

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
keep the faces in storage without having

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
keep the faces in storage without having
to<00:00:59.670> constantly<00:01:00.230> open<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> box<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.829> take<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
expect from it you know considering what

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
expect from it you know considering what
it<00:01:42.990> looked<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.439> anime<00:01:43.740> there's<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it looked like in the anime there's a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
it looked like in the anime there's a
bit<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> scratching<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.570> red<00:01:45.750> paint<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
bit of scratching on my red paint here I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
bit of scratching on my red paint here I
don't<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.280> never<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> because

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
don't know I can never get that because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
don't know I can never get that because
it's<00:01:48.600> such<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> small<00:01:49.020> detail<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.399> just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it's such a small detail but it just

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.679 
it's such a small detail but it just
kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> looks<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.880> they'd<00:01:51.060> rush<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> throw

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
kind of looks like they'd rush to throw

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
kind of looks like they'd rush to throw
the<00:01:51.840> red<00:01:51.990> paint<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.320> versus<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> other<00:01:53.100> paint

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the red paint on versus the other paint

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.319

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
the pinkies up it's just kind of odd I

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.130 
the pinkies up it's just kind of odd I
guess<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.060> her<00:03:21.150> character<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:21.840> know

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
guess for her character I don't know

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.070 
guess for her character I don't know
since<00:03:22.350> Sailor<00:03:22.860> Uranus<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:24.080> really

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
since Sailor Uranus is like really

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.760 
since Sailor Uranus is like really
tomboyish

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
tomboyish

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.490 
tomboyish
and<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.610> know<00:03:26.870> she<00:03:27.870> has<00:03:27.959> her<00:03:28.080> hand<00:03:28.290> for

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and you know she has her hand for

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.480 
and you know she has her hand for
holding<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> sword

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
holding the sword

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.670 
holding the sword
another<00:03:30.480> splayed<00:03:30.870> open<00:03:30.900> hand<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.590> another

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
another splayed open hand and another

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.010 
another splayed open hand and another
one<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.220> believe<00:03:33.150> some<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.420> these<00:03:33.570> are<00:03:33.750> meant<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
one I believe some of these are meant to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.949 
one I believe some of these are meant to
use<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:35.070> conjunction<00:03:35.580> with<00:03:35.930> Sailor<00:03:36.930> Neptune

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
use a in conjunction with Sailor Neptune

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.100 
use a in conjunction with Sailor Neptune
when<00:03:37.470> she<00:03:37.620> comes<00:03:37.860> out<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.780> like<00:03:39.780> they<00:03:39.959> really

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
when she comes out but like they really

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.870 
when she comes out but like they really
some<00:03:40.350> promo<00:03:40.680> images<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.550> guess<00:03:41.760> they're

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
some promo images and I guess they're

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.220 
some promo images and I guess they're
not<00:03:41.970> absolutely<00:03:42.360> necessary<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:43.020> I<00:03:43.080> guess

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
not absolutely necessary but I guess

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.350 
not absolutely necessary but I guess
they're<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> better<00:03:44.340> way<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.520> make<00:03:44.760> posing

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
they're just a better way to make posing

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.160 
they're just a better way to make posing
with<00:03:45.510> them<00:03:45.690> more<00:03:45.989> accurate<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.520> easy<00:03:47.900> but<00:03:48.900> as

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
with them more accurate and easy but as

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
like they can pop off in two different

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.189 
like they can pop off in two different
spots<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.789> arms<00:05:51.120> on<00:05:51.270> here<00:05:51.479> one<00:05:51.750> solid

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
piece so you don't have to worry about

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.310 
piece so you don't have to worry about
popping<00:05:53.669> everything<00:05:53.909> off<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:55.229> know

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
popping everything off it and you know

popping everything off it and you know
pieces<00:05:55.590> going<00:05:55.949> everywhere<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:57.270> switching

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
pieces going everywhere so switching

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.350 
pieces going everywhere so switching
arms<00:05:57.960> might<00:05:58.169> not<00:05:58.620> be<00:05:58.770> too<00:05:58.979> bad<00:05:59.130> but<00:05:59.849> uh<00:05:59.909> she<00:06:00.270> has

expected with the new figure she doesn't

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.360 
expected with the new figure she doesn't
really<00:06:12.930> have<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.349> pull-down<00:06:13.590> legs<00:06:13.979> oh<00:06:14.250> she

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
her legs are so long already you know so

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.070 
her legs are so long already you know so
she<00:06:20.159> could<00:06:20.310> kick<00:06:20.639> out<00:06:20.789> pretty<00:06:21.030> far<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.750> split

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
she could kick out pretty far the split

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.990 
she could kick out pretty far the split
in<00:06:22.169> the<00:06:22.229> skirt<00:06:22.530> is<00:06:22.800> there<00:06:23.159> to<00:06:23.370> allow<00:06:23.550> more<00:06:23.759> leg

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
in the skirt is there to allow more leg

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.870 
in the skirt is there to allow more leg
movement<00:06:24.800> single<00:06:25.800> joint<00:06:26.009> knee<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:28.639> the<00:06:29.639> ankle

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
movement single joint knee and the ankle

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.930 
movement single joint knee and the ankle
pivot<00:06:30.590> sadly<00:06:31.590> still<00:06:31.650> note<00:06:31.979> articulation<00:06:32.759> but

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
pivot sadly still note articulation but

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.550 
pivot sadly still note articulation but
their<00:06:33.150> feet<00:06:33.330> are<00:06:33.449> so<00:06:33.599> small<00:06:33.870> that<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:34.320> can't

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
their feet are so small that you can't

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.839 
their feet are so small that you can't
really<00:06:34.650> fit<00:06:34.949> it<00:06:35.070> in<00:06:35.190> there<00:06:35.400> anyway

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
really fit it in there anyway

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.290 
really fit it in there anyway
I<00:06:36.709> guess<00:06:37.709> I<00:06:37.889> have<00:06:38.039> to<00:06:38.159> say<00:06:38.339> like<00:06:38.550> most<00:06:38.969> notably

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
I guess I have to say like most notably

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.389 
I guess I have to say like most notably
they<00:06:39.509> got<00:06:39.659> her<00:06:39.779> face<00:06:40.080> right<00:06:40.439> which<00:06:40.830> i<00:06:41.099> think<00:06:41.219> is

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:41.399 
they got her face right which i think is

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.339 
they got her face right which i think is
pretty<00:06:41.580> cool<00:06:41.759> she<00:06:42.569> was<00:06:42.659> one<00:06:42.749> of<00:06:42.779> my<00:06:42.869> favorite

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
pretty cool she was one of my favorite

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.049 
pretty cool she was one of my favorite
characters<00:06:43.709> and<00:06:43.740> it's<00:06:44.039> it's<00:06:44.669> really<00:06:44.879> great<00:06:45.029> to

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
characters and it's it's really great to

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:46.510 
characters and it's it's really great to
see<00:06:45.300> like<00:06:45.449> they<00:06:45.569> could<00:06:45.719> still<00:06:45.899> make<00:06:46.050> her<00:06:46.169> look

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
see like they could still make her look

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.010 
see like they could still make her look
masculine<00:06:47.520> enough<00:06:47.729> I<00:06:47.939> guess<00:06:48.119> to<00:06:48.389> pass<00:06:48.629> off<00:06:48.839> as

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
masculine enough I guess to pass off as

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.379 
masculine enough I guess to pass off as
a<00:06:49.050> boy<00:06:49.289> like<00:06:49.589> they<00:06:49.740> did<00:06:49.949> in<00:06:50.639> the<00:06:50.759> anime<00:06:51.059> but<00:06:51.089> the

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
a boy like they did in the anime but the

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.269 
a boy like they did in the anime but the
same<00:06:51.539> time<00:06:51.719> she's<00:06:52.020> feminine<00:06:52.469> enough<00:06:52.559> that<00:06:52.919> you

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:53.279 
same time she's feminine enough that you

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.609 
same time she's feminine enough that you
know<00:06:53.369> she<00:06:53.759> doesn't<00:06:53.909> look<00:06:54.149> like<00:06:54.379> she<00:06:55.379> doesn't

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:55.619 
know she doesn't look like she doesn't

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.230 
know she doesn't look like she doesn't
look<00:06:55.709> too<00:06:55.770> like<00:06:56.129> too<00:06:56.279> manly<00:06:56.490> of<00:06:56.639> a<00:06:56.789> woman<00:06:57.089> or

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
look too like too manly of a woman or

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.909 
look too like too manly of a woman or
too<00:06:57.479> girly<00:06:57.869> of<00:06:57.899> a<00:06:58.020> guy<00:06:59.509> she's<00:07:00.509> cool<00:07:00.749> um<00:07:01.020> I<00:07:01.619> guess

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
for comparison I can get Sailor Mars out

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.570 
for comparison I can get Sailor Mars out
just<00:07:04.379> to<00:07:04.499> show<00:07:04.619> the<00:07:04.770> height<00:07:04.949> and<00:07:05.159> real<00:07:05.309> fast

just to show the height and real fast
and<00:07:11.779> yeah<00:07:12.830> so<00:07:13.830> just<00:07:13.949> for<00:07:14.129> height<00:07:14.279> sake<00:07:14.610> I<00:07:14.969> know

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
and yeah so just for height sake I know

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.359 
and yeah so just for height sake I know
their<00:07:15.569> legs<00:07:15.809> aren't<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.169> same<00:07:16.349> but<00:07:16.409> they're

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:17.369 
their legs aren't the same but they're

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.209 
their legs aren't the same but they're
kind<00:07:17.610> of<00:07:17.699> onto<00:07:18.059> the<00:07:18.149> same<00:07:18.389> staying<00:07:19.289> the<00:07:20.189> same

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
kind of onto the same staying the same

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.219 
kind of onto the same staying the same
stage<00:07:20.580> so<00:07:20.819> you<00:07:20.909> can<00:07:21.029> see<00:07:21.149> just<00:07:21.330> how<00:07:21.419> short<00:07:21.809> like

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
stage so you can see just how short like

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.339 
stage so you can see just how short like
I<00:07:22.789> can't<00:07:23.789> say<00:07:23.909> like<00:07:24.119> it's<00:07:24.360> by<00:07:24.599> much<00:07:24.869> but<00:07:25.169> it's

I can't say like it's by much but it's

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:26.929 
I can't say like it's by much but it's
very<00:07:25.499> noticeable<00:07:25.979> on<00:07:26.159> figures<00:07:26.580> that<00:07:26.729> are<00:07:26.789> in<00:07:26.879> a

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:26.939 
very noticeable on figures that are in a

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.909 
very noticeable on figures that are in a
six-inch<00:07:27.330> scale<00:07:27.629> that<00:07:27.929> the<00:07:28.589> difference

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
six-inch scale that the difference

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.329 
six-inch scale that the difference
between<00:07:29.069> her<00:07:29.369> and<00:07:29.610> Mars<00:07:30.569> is<00:07:30.809> you<00:07:31.679> know<00:07:31.800> just

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:32.339 
between her and Mars is you know just

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:34.309 
between her and Mars is you know just
how<00:07:32.459> it<00:07:32.490> should<00:07:32.759> be<00:07:32.909> she's<00:07:33.209> really<00:07:33.749> tall<00:07:33.929> she

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
how it should be she's really tall she

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.839 
how it should be she's really tall she
looks<00:07:34.499> like<00:07:34.589> an<00:07:34.740> older<00:07:34.979> character<00:07:35.399> so<00:07:35.669> if<00:07:35.759> she

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
looks like an older character so if she

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:40.249 
looks like an older character so if she
fits<00:07:36.059> Justin<00:07:36.509> and<00:07:37.909> hmm<00:07:38.909> I<00:07:39.240> guess<00:07:39.930> that's<00:07:40.139> it

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 
fits Justin and hmm I guess that's it

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.749 
fits Justin and hmm I guess that's it
but<00:07:40.619> I<00:07:40.829> have<00:07:40.949> to<00:07:41.039> say<00:07:41.159> I'm<00:07:41.249> really<00:07:41.399> excited

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
but I have to say I'm really excited

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.159 
but I have to say I'm really excited
that<00:07:41.939> we're<00:07:42.180> almost<00:07:42.389> done<00:07:42.779> with<00:07:42.930> all<00:07:43.079> the

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
that we're almost done with all the

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:45.139 
that we're almost done with all the
sailors<00:07:43.499> we<00:07:43.949> just<00:07:44.099> have<00:07:44.219> Neptune<00:07:44.699> and

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:45.149 
sailors we just have Neptune and

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.379 
sailors we just have Neptune and
hopefully<00:07:46.099> they<00:07:47.099> reveal<00:07:47.399> a<00:07:47.430> Pluto<00:07:47.879> soon<00:07:48.149> I

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:48.389 
hopefully they reveal a Pluto soon I

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.569 
hopefully they reveal a Pluto soon I
know<00:07:48.659> we're<00:07:48.869> getting<00:07:48.959> chibi<00:07:49.499> moon<00:07:49.680> and<00:07:49.979> Tuxedo

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:50.579 
know we're getting chibi moon and Tuxedo

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:54.049 
know we're getting chibi moon and Tuxedo
Mask<00:07:50.779> next<00:07:51.779> year<00:07:52.019> but<00:07:52.949> I<00:07:53.279> really<00:07:53.819> hope<00:07:53.939> they

00:07:54.049 --> 00:07:54.059 
Mask next year but I really hope they

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.519 
Mask next year but I really hope they
reveal<00:07:54.329> Pluto<00:07:54.689> and<00:07:54.839> then<00:07:54.959> that<00:07:55.139> way<00:07:55.259> we<00:07:55.379> can

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:55.529 
reveal Pluto and then that way we can

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.769 
reveal Pluto and then that way we can
have<00:07:55.680> them<00:07:55.919> main<00:07:56.369> nine<00:07:56.669> and<00:07:57.240> then<00:07:57.569> hopefully

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:57.779 
have them main nine and then hopefully

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.469 
have them main nine and then hopefully
will<00:07:58.199> step<00:07:58.439> into<00:07:58.559> the<00:07:58.680> villains<00:07:59.039> like<00:07:59.879> galaxia

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 
will step into the villains like galaxia

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.839 
will step into the villains like galaxia
or<00:08:00.749> maybe<00:08:00.959> Jedi<00:08:01.889> in<00:08:02.159> them<00:08:02.339> if<00:08:02.490> they<00:08:02.639> want<00:08:02.819> to

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:02.849 
or maybe Jedi in them if they want to

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.509 
or maybe Jedi in them if they want to
used<00:08:03.029> to<00:08:03.059> Tuxedo<00:08:03.479> Mask<00:08:03.539> mode<00:08:04.019> but<00:08:04.319> if<00:08:05.249> you've

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:05.519 
used to Tuxedo Mask mode but if you've

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.709 
used to Tuxedo Mask mode but if you've
been<00:08:05.639> collecting<00:08:05.999> this<00:08:06.119> far<00:08:06.329> there's<00:08:06.569> nothing

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:06.719 
been collecting this far there's nothing

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.299 
been collecting this far there's nothing
I<00:08:06.929> could<00:08:07.050> say<00:08:07.079> other<00:08:07.319> than<00:08:07.409> go<00:08:07.709> get<00:08:07.889> Sailor

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:08.309 
I could say other than go get Sailor

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:11.179 
I could say other than go get Sailor
Uranus<00:08:08.490> right<00:08:09.029> now
