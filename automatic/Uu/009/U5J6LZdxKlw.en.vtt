tylenol one disposable diaper just in

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.260 
tylenol one disposable diaper just in
case<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:33.720> that's<00:04:34.110> pretty<00:04:34.500> much<00:04:34.620> all<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.460> we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
case so that's pretty much all that we

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.750 
case so that's pretty much all that we
have<00:04:36.510> in<00:04:36.690> here<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.860> types<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.310> diapers<00:04:38.729> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
have in here the types of diapers that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.670 
have in here the types of diapers that
we<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.450> are<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.880> alpha<00:04:42.479> baby<00:04:42.690> diapers<00:04:43.229> I

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
we have are the alpha baby diapers I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.230 
we have are the alpha baby diapers I
think<00:04:43.950> those<00:04:44.100> are<00:04:44.130> we<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.729> have<00:04:44.880> all<00:04:44.910> my

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
think those are we just have all my

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.030 
think those are we just have all my
babies<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.750> there's<00:04:46.050> eight<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.500> them<00:04:46.650> in<00:04:46.830> here

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
babies so there's eight of them in here

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.350 
babies so there's eight of them in here
and<00:04:47.610> everything<00:04:48.120> fits<00:04:48.330> really<00:04:48.720> well<00:04:49.160> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
and everything fits really well and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.820 
and everything fits really well and
that's<00:04:51.360> pretty<00:04:51.570> much<00:04:51.720> all<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.020> would<00:04:52.320> need<00:04:52.500> I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that's pretty much all I would need I

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.240 
that's pretty much all I would need I
would<00:04:53.460> also<00:04:53.580> probably<00:04:53.910> bring<00:04:54.270> my<00:04:54.450> camera

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
would also probably bring my camera

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.440
