tie rod on the center link is where you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.699 
tie rod on the center link is where you
would<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.150> necessary<00:03:37.330> adjustments<00:03:37.900> this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
is a sleeve actually and you loosen it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.650 
is a sleeve actually and you loosen it
and<00:03:42.700> that's<00:03:42.880> where<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.240> would<00:03:43.330> make<00:03:43.540> your

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
and that's where you would make your

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.230 
and that's where you would make your
adjustments<00:03:44.380> for<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> steering<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:46.090> make

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
adjustments for the steering to make

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.360 
adjustments for the steering to make
sure<00:03:46.390> it's<00:03:46.570> straight<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.740> again<00:03:48.040> there's<00:03:48.280> an

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
sure it's straight so again there's an

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.790 
sure it's straight so again there's an
outer<00:03:48.550> tie<00:03:48.910> rod<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.390> center<00:03:49.750> link<00:03:49.959> adjustment

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
outer tie rod the center link adjustment

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.530 
outer tie rod the center link adjustment
and<00:03:50.980> an<00:03:51.160> inner<00:03:51.400> tie<00:03:51.670> rod<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.150> then<00:03:52.300> there's<00:03:52.480> a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and an inner tie rod so then there's a

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.580 
and an inner tie rod so then there's a
grease<00:03:52.930> point<00:03:53.520> located<00:03:54.520> there<00:03:55.020> on<00:03:56.020> that<00:03:56.260> side

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
grease point located there on that side

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.330 
grease point located there on that side
and<00:03:58.290> there's<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> old<00:03:59.560> one<00:03:59.800> you<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.040> see<00:04:00.220> how

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
and there's the old one you can see how

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.850 
and there's the old one you can see how
bent<00:04:00.610> up<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.970> this<00:04:01.140> that's<00:04:02.140> why<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.380> needed<00:04:02.770> to

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
bent up to this that's why I needed to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.880 
bent up to this that's why I needed to
change<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.340> after<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.700> car<00:04:03.940> was<00:04:04.120> hit<00:04:04.450> on<00:04:04.660> that

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
change it after the car was hit on that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.479 
change it after the car was hit on that
fender<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.010> wheel<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.770> as<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.459> mentioned

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
fender and wheel and as I mentioned

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.770 
fender and wheel and as I mentioned
before<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:10.150> went<00:04:10.360> through<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.600> whole

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
before I went through the whole

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.510 
before I went through the whole
suspension<00:04:11.110> system<00:04:11.800> that's<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.130> only<00:04:12.340> part

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
suspension system that's the only part

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.340 
suspension system that's the only part
that's<00:04:12.610> bad<00:04:12.940> these<00:04:13.270> parts<00:04:13.600> have<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.810> very<00:04:14.020> solid

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
that's bad these parts have a very solid

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.310 
that's bad these parts have a very solid
suspension<00:04:16.200> if<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.380> was<00:04:17.500> done<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.950> a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
suspension if it was done to a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.530 
suspension if it was done to a
a<00:04:19.470> smaller<00:04:20.160> newer<00:04:20.490> car<00:04:20.820> definitely<00:04:21.180> would

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
a smaller newer car definitely would

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.900 
a smaller newer car definitely would
have<00:04:21.570> caused<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> lot<00:04:22.020> more<00:04:22.170> damage<00:04:22.410> but<00:04:22.910> this

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
have caused a lot more damage but this

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.950 
have caused a lot more damage but this
car<00:04:24.150> that's<00:04:24.360> all<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:24.780> necessary<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.900> a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
car that's all that was necessary it's a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.490 
car that's all that was necessary it's a
fairly<00:04:28.170> simple<00:04:28.410> job<00:04:28.830> no<00:04:29.640> problem<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:34.200> there<00:04:34.380> it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
fairly simple job no problem so there it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.680 
fairly simple job no problem so there it
is<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.040> my<00:04:35.370> next<00:04:35.430> task<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.270> going<00:04:36.480> to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
is and my next task is I'm going to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.220 
is and my next task is I'm going to
actually<00:04:37.760> decrease<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.790> whole<00:04:39.240> suspension

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
actually decrease that whole suspension

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.350 
actually decrease that whole suspension
the<00:04:40.770> valve<00:04:40.980> covers<00:04:41.430> were<00:04:41.550> leaking<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:42.060> lot<00:04:42.180> of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
the valve covers were leaking a lot of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.110 
the valve covers were leaking a lot of
oil<00:04:42.540> I've<00:04:42.780> changed<00:04:43.110> those<00:04:43.380> already<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
oil I've changed those already so the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.970 
oil I've changed those already so the
leaking<00:04:45.450> is<00:04:45.570> stopped<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.140> now<00:04:46.230> I'm<00:04:46.920> just

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
leaking is stopped and now I'm just

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.680 
leaking is stopped and now I'm just
going<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.340> clean<00:04:47.580> up<00:04:47.760> few<00:04:48.150> things<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.600> you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
going to clean up few things that you

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.240 
going to clean up few things that you
shouldn't<00:04:48.930> forget<00:04:49.410> when<00:04:49.620> you're<00:04:49.740> doing<00:04:50.010> car
