00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
Chen we use this technique of going like

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
Chen we use this technique of going like
this<00:00:29.900> or<00:00:30.900> tiger<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:33.020> or<00:00:34.020> sometimes

the<00:00:49.680> fighting<00:00:50.010> applications<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:51.090> pretty

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
the fighting applications are pretty

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.080 
the fighting applications are pretty
similar<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:53.160> somebody<00:00:53.460> ever<00:00:53.520> goes<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> grab

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
similar so if somebody ever goes to grab

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
similar so if somebody ever goes to grab
onto<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.420> shoulder<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.080> arm<00:00:55.260> right

street somebody actually might grab onto

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.790 
street somebody actually might grab onto
you<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.300> like<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.650> do

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
you just like this and what you can do

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.570 
you just like this and what you can do
is<00:01:10.979> step<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.820> opposite<00:01:12.360> leg<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:13.320> them

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
is step the opposite leg right into them

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
is step the opposite leg right into them
bring<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.880> arm<00:01:15.240> underneath<00:01:15.690> their<00:01:16.080> elbow

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
bring this arm underneath their elbow

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.359 
bring this arm underneath their elbow
this<00:01:17.460> arm<00:01:17.820> traps<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> arm<00:01:18.630> against<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.170> body

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
this arm traps the arm against your body

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
this arm traps the arm against your body
I'm<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> lock<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> out<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.930> turn

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.840 

and<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.550> motion

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
and this is the motion

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.420 
and this is the motion
we<00:01:28.300> just<00:01:28.540> showed

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
we just showed

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.550 
we just showed
again<00:01:30.790> they<00:01:30.880> grab<00:01:31.030> onto<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.360> shoulder<00:01:31.720> wrap

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
again they grab onto the shoulder wrap

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.060 
again they grab onto the shoulder wrap
it<00:01:32.770> behind<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.520> elbow<00:01:33.640> turn<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.770> there's<00:01:39.010> a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
it behind the elbow turn now there's a

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.940 
it behind the elbow turn now there's a
few<00:01:39.220> important<00:01:39.640> things<00:01:39.670> for<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.090> technique

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
few important things for this technique

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.340 
few important things for this technique
if<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.010> allow<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.120> hand<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.960> get<00:01:44.080> away<00:01:44.170> from

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
if you allow this hand to get away from

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.280 
if you allow this hand to get away from
your<00:01:44.650> body<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.540> eliminate<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
your body it's going to eliminate the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.910 
your body it's going to eliminate the
tension<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.220> their<00:01:48.370> elbow<00:01:48.700> will<00:01:48.880> feel<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
tension that their elbow will feel so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.360 
tension that their elbow will feel so
I'll<00:01:51.250> be<00:01:51.520> turning<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.770> arm<00:01:53.950> goes<00:01:54.190> with

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
I'll be turning and the arm goes with

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.530 
I'll be turning and the arm goes with
the<00:01:54.490> elbow<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.790> had<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.150> half<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.450> dozen

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
the elbow I had about half a dozen

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.290 
the elbow I had about half a dozen
students<00:01:55.990> tonight<00:01:56.140> doing<00:01:56.410> this<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:57.300> that

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
students tonight doing this and that

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.820 
students tonight doing this and that
person<00:01:58.540> felt<00:01:58.930> nothing<00:01:59.110> okay

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
person felt nothing okay

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.860 
person felt nothing okay
you<00:02:00.160> have<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.640> lock<00:02:00.940> this<00:02:01.210> against<00:02:01.600> your<00:02:01.690> body

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
you have to lock this against your body

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.640 
you have to lock this against your body
and<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:02.800> way<00:02:02.980> this<00:02:03.670> point<00:02:04.210> stays<00:02:05.080> trapped

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
and that way this point stays trapped

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.220 
and that way this point stays trapped
and<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.850> increase<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.480> leverage<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
and you can increase the leverage to the

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.160 
and you can increase the leverage to the
elbow<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.830> way<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:10.179> when<00:02:10.600> my<00:02:10.720> arms<00:02:11.020> are<00:02:11.110> in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
elbow this way now when my arms are in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.590 
elbow this way now when my arms are in
this<00:02:11.320> position<00:02:11.830> I'm<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:12.730> going<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.150> use<00:02:13.270> arm

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
this position I'm not going to use arm

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.570 
this position I'm not going to use arm
we're<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.050> reposition<00:02:14.350> my<00:02:14.860> legs<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.520> my

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
we're going to reposition my legs and my

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.950 
we're going to reposition my legs and my
body<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.350> move<00:02:17.620> him<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.190> elbow

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
body so I can move him with that elbow

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.280 
body so I can move him with that elbow
rope<00:02:20.940> then<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.360> shut<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.900> push<00:02:23.110> away

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
rope then I can just shut and push away

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.700 
rope then I can just shut and push away
