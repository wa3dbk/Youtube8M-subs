for<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.659> comment<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.430> I'm<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> try

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759

for this comment and I'm going to try
this<00:00:05.819> out<00:00:06.029> real<00:00:06.270> quick<00:00:06.299> it's<00:00:06.690> called<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
this out real quick it's called the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.830 
this out real quick it's called the
float<00:00:07.230> test<00:00:07.440> it's<00:00:08.250> not<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:09.000> invasive<00:00:09.330> if<00:00:09.780> you

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
float test it's not very invasive if you

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.299 
float test it's not very invasive if you
don't<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.260> start<00:00:10.469> cracking<00:00:10.830> eggs<00:00:10.920> open

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
don't have to start cracking eggs open

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.459 
don't have to start cracking eggs open
or<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.639> anything<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.059> that

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
or do anything like that

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.650 
or do anything like that
you<00:00:13.920> know<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.280> agree<00:00:14.370> Dean<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.240> buddy<00:00:15.420> Dean

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
you know and I agree Dean my buddy Dean

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.390 
you know and I agree Dean my buddy Dean
he<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:16.109> mentioned<00:00:16.440> also<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.220> kind<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
he just mentioned also to just kind of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.820 
he just mentioned also to just kind of
let<00:00:17.550> him<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.820> their<00:00:18.000> thing<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.650> they'll<00:00:19.650> come

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
let him do their thing and they'll come

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.950 
let him do their thing and they'll come
when<00:00:20.010> they're<00:00:20.160> ready<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> something

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
when they're ready but this is something

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
when they're ready but this is something
that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.590> could<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.859> real<00:00:23.100> quick<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that I think I could do real quick and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
that I think I could do real quick and
also<00:00:23.640> moisten<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> eggs<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.289> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
also moisten the eggs up a little bit so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
also moisten the eggs up a little bit so
that<00:00:26.010> way<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.340> might<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:27.000> able<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.330> out

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that way they might be able to get out

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.880 
that way they might be able to get out
of<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.660> easier<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.500> called<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of there easier and it's called the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
of there easier and it's called the
float<00:00:29.130> test<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> there's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> there's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> link

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
float test and there's a there's a link

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
float test and there's a there's a link
in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> last<00:00:31.830> video<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> did<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.390> talks

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
in the last video I did and it talks

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
in the last video I did and it talks
about<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> look<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> eggs

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
about what to look for you know the eggs

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
about what to look for you know the eggs
that<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:37.469> didn't<00:00:37.890> even<00:00:38.010> develop

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that you know didn't even develop

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
that you know didn't even develop
they'll<00:00:38.700> sink<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> bottom<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
they'll sink right to the bottom and you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.690 
they'll sink right to the bottom and you
kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.710> something<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.340> floating

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
kind of want something that's floating

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.290 
kind of want something that's floating
kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.969> halfway<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.570> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.809> moving<00:00:43.079> so

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
kind of halfway and kind of moving so

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.180 
kind of halfway and kind of moving so
maybe<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.260> give<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> try

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
maybe I could do that and give it a try

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
maybe I could do that and give it a try
real<00:00:47.399> quick<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.820> saw<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
real quick you just saw that this is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.920 
real quick you just saw that this is
just<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> store-bought<00:00:49.260> egg<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:52.320> sinks<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
just a store-bought egg and it sinks so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
just a store-bought egg and it sinks so
let's<00:00:54.930> let's<00:00:55.350> give<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> other

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
let's let's give some one of the other

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.069 
let's let's give some one of the other
ones<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> try<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:56.969> least<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> ocean<00:00:59.370> let<00:00:59.640> me<00:00:59.760> do

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
ones a try at least and ocean let me do

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.670 
ones a try at least and ocean let me do
past<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.230> bedtime<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.920> quiet<00:01:02.309> okay<00:01:02.520> baby

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
past your bedtime you be quiet okay baby

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.960 
past your bedtime you be quiet okay baby
all<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> try<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:06.470> and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.780 

okay<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.770> don't<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
okay I don't know which way to put this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
okay I don't know which way to put this
egg<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.030> X<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.450> should<00:01:15.540> probably<00:01:15.780> check<00:01:16.020> for

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
egg and X I should probably check for

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.890 
egg and X I should probably check for
cracks<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> stuff<00:01:17.009> first<00:01:17.420> otherwise<00:01:18.420> still

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
cracks and stuff first otherwise still

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.460 
cracks and stuff first otherwise still
drowned<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:20.000> don't<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.210> any<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.020> want

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
drowned I don't see any on there I want

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.810 
drowned I don't see any on there I want
to<00:01:22.530> move<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> around<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:26.479> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.219 

this<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:34.580> it's<00:01:35.580> not<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:36.750> moving

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this one right here it's not it's moving

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
this one right here it's not it's moving
long<00:01:37.530> enough<00:01:37.800> that's<00:01:38.010> ocean<00:01:38.340> doing<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:39.200> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
long enough that's ocean doing that it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.280 
long enough that's ocean doing that it's
kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.560> moving<00:01:40.830> but<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> sunk<00:01:42.710> all<00:01:43.710> right

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
kind of moving but it sunk all right

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.320 
kind of moving but it sunk all right
that's<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.009> egg<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.520> moving<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
that's one this egg is moving in the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.840 
that's one this egg is moving in the
incubator<00:01:48.660> it's<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.310> accurate

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
incubator it's not at all how accurate

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.830 
incubator it's not at all how accurate
that<00:01:51.780> float<00:01:52.500> test<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.210> not<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.240> person<00:01:54.690> that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that float test is not the person that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.249 
that float test is not the person that
posted<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> said<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.830> pretty<00:01:56.100> accurate

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
posted it said it was pretty accurate

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.320 
posted it said it was pretty accurate
but<00:01:58.259> um<00:01:58.650> even<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.670> doesn't<00:01:59.820> work<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.150> guess

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
but um even if it doesn't work I guess

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.690 
but um even if it doesn't work I guess
I'm<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.600> kind<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.840> moistening<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I'm just kind of moistening up the the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.969 
I'm just kind of moistening up the the
eggs<00:02:02.910> real<00:02:03.240> good

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
eggs real good

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.050 
eggs real good
so<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.220> they'll<00:02:05.369> hatch<00:02:05.550> better<00:02:05.820> let<00:02:06.030> me

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so that way they'll hatch better let me

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
so that way they'll hatch better let me
check<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.720> there's<00:02:06.899> any<00:02:07.080> cracks<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
check to see if there's any cracks in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.680 
check to see if there's any cracks in
this<00:02:07.800> one<00:02:09.110> no<00:02:10.110> cracks<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> say<00:02:12.510> hi

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
this one no cracks you want to say hi

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.380 
this one no cracks you want to say hi
ocean<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:14.220> wanna<00:02:14.370> say<00:02:14.519> I'm<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.820> past<00:02:15.239> my

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
is also moving in the incubator and I'm

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.770 
is also moving in the incubator and I'm
just<00:02:24.480> gonna<00:02:25.310> set<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.120> ocean<00:02:27.600> I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
just gonna set this one in here ocean I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.250 
just gonna set this one in here ocean I
need<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.140> nut<00:02:28.380> bump<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:32.850> there<00:02:33.260> as

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
need your nut bump and that one there as

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.080 
need your nut bump and that one there as
you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.620> see<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.850> just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you can see it's just kind of just

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
you can see it's just kind of just
barely<00:02:36.329> floating<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:37.620> where<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.070> air

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
barely floating that's where the air

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.340 
barely floating that's where the air
pocket<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.660> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.959> moving<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
pocket is and it it's kind of moving a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.500 
pocket is and it it's kind of moving a
little<00:02:43.709> bit<00:02:43.950> back<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.310> forth<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:47.510> guess

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
little bit back and forth so I guess

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.670 
little bit back and forth so I guess
this<00:02:48.810> one<00:02:49.049> here<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.440> viable<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.489> other<00:02:50.760> egg

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
this one here is viable the other egg

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.990 
this one here is viable the other egg
maybe<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> chicken<00:02:53.100> broke<00:02:53.489> through<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.820> air

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
maybe the chicken broke through the air

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.100 
maybe the chicken broke through the air
pocket<00:02:54.480> maybe<00:02:55.880> okay<00:02:56.910> we'll<00:02:57.570> be<00:02:57.660> real<00:02:57.870> careful

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
pocket maybe okay we'll be real careful

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.539 
pocket maybe okay we'll be real careful
and<00:02:58.380> put<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.739> one<00:02:58.950> back<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.190> there<00:03:00.410> all<00:03:01.410> right

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
and put this one back in there all right

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.650 
and put this one back in there all right
there's<00:03:02.549> two<00:03:02.850> down<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:05.670> try<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.030> one<00:03:06.450> all

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
there's two down we try this one all

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.100 
there's two down we try this one all
four<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.959> them<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.380> wiggling<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.579> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
four of them are wiggling I can see the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.410 
four of them are wiggling I can see the
egg<00:03:10.110> kind<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.590> moving<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.299> we

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
egg kind of moving a little bit and we

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.910 
egg kind of moving a little bit and we
check<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.019> there's<00:03:13.230> any<00:03:13.350> cracks<00:03:13.680> on

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
check to see if there's any cracks on

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.039 
check to see if there's any cracks on
this<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.200> float<00:03:16.500> test<00:03:17.030> and

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
this one so this is the float test and

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.290 
this one so this is the float test and
Fred<00:03:19.049> H<00:03:19.230> gave<00:03:19.680> me<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.100> idea<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.959> link

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.390 

okay<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.540> was<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.870> wrong<00:03:27.080> direction<00:03:30.400> this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
okay that was the wrong direction this

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.630 
okay that was the wrong direction this
one<00:03:31.640> right<00:03:31.790> here<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.420> same<00:03:32.450> thing<00:03:33.640> it's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
one right here it's the same thing it's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.210 
one right here it's the same thing it's
about<00:03:34.730> 10%<00:03:35.120> over<00:03:35.780> if<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.620> could<00:03:36.770> get<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.070> little

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
about 10% over if I could get the little

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.920 
about 10% over if I could get the little
guy<00:03:37.460> in<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.700> chair<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.090> stop<00:03:38.330> moving<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.900> a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
guy in the chair to stop moving for a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.980 
guy in the chair to stop moving for a
second<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.010> we'll<00:03:40.250> see<00:03:40.460> if<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:41.420> eggs<00:03:41.630> kind<00:03:41.900> of

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
second and we'll see if the eggs kind of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.170 
second and we'll see if the eggs kind of
wobbling<00:03:45.490> yeah<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.520> don't<00:03:46.730> know<00:03:46.880> if<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.030> guys

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
wobbling yeah I don't know if you guys

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.640 
wobbling yeah I don't know if you guys
can<00:03:47.360> see<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:47.840> it's<00:03:47.960> kind<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.290> moving<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
can see it but it's kind of moving a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.720 
can see it but it's kind of moving a
little<00:03:48.830> bit<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:51.610> okay<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:52.640> one<00:03:53.360> kind<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:54.020> sink

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
little bit so okay so one kind of sink

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.550 
little bit so okay so one kind of sink
the<00:03:55.730> other<00:03:55.760> two<00:03:56.330> are<00:03:57.430> floating<00:03:58.430> just<00:03:58.790> barely

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
the other two are floating just barely

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.580 
the other two are floating just barely
ten<00:04:00.560> percent<00:04:01.070> in<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.700> water<00:04:02.110> all<00:04:03.110> right<00:04:03.350> let

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
ten percent in the water all right let

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.110 
ten percent in the water all right let
me<00:04:03.650> get<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.950> last<00:04:04.160> one<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:05.480> big<00:04:05.690> one<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:07.550> this

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
me get the last one the big one and this

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.530 
me get the last one the big one and this
one's<00:04:08.390> really<00:04:08.750> really<00:04:09.020> moving<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:09.980> can<00:04:10.160> tell

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
one's really really moving you can tell

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.300 
one's really really moving you can tell
and<00:04:11.540> I'm<00:04:12.410> just<00:04:12.560> kind<00:04:12.770> of<00:04:12.800> checking<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:13.280> right

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
and I'm just kind of checking it right

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.990 
and I'm just kind of checking it right
now<00:04:13.580> for<00:04:13.910> some<00:04:14.090> cracks<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:15.400> don't<00:04:16.400> really<00:04:16.640> see

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
now for some cracks I don't really see

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.580 
now for some cracks I don't really see
any<00:04:17.209> hopefully<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> don't<00:04:17.930> drop<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.380> darn

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
any hopefully I don't drop the darn

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.770 
any hopefully I don't drop the darn
thing<00:04:18.890> yes<00:04:19.910> nope<00:04:20.239> no<00:04:20.540> cracks<00:04:20.900> oh<00:04:21.140> sure<00:04:22.450> okay

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
thing yes nope no cracks oh sure okay

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.960 
thing yes nope no cracks oh sure okay
and<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.620> couldn't<00:04:24.920> agree<00:04:25.040> with<00:04:25.220> my<00:04:25.520> buddy<00:04:25.730> Dean

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
and I couldn't agree with my buddy Dean

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.170 
and I couldn't agree with my buddy Dean
more<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.930> know<00:04:27.080> he's<00:04:27.380> got<00:04:27.770> he<00:04:28.430> he<00:04:28.880> grew<00:04:29.030> up<00:04:29.090> on

a ranch and he said that he had a horse
that<00:04:35.750> would<00:04:35.930> um<00:04:36.170> lace<00:04:37.040> she'd<00:04:37.640> have<00:04:37.790> her<00:04:37.940> baby

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
that would um lace she'd have her baby

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.010 
that would um lace she'd have her baby
two<00:04:38.930> weeks<00:04:38.960> after<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.970> kind<00:04:41.480> of<00:04:41.540> greed<00:04:41.750> kind

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
two weeks after and I kind of greed kind

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.360 
two weeks after and I kind of greed kind
of<00:04:42.080> sometimes<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:42.740> let<00:04:42.860> nature<00:04:42.890> take<00:04:43.340> its

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
of sometimes just let nature take its

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.390 
of sometimes just let nature take its
course<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.910> guess<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:45.050> three<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.800> eggs<00:04:45.980> have

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
course I guess so three of the eggs have

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.710 
course I guess so three of the eggs have
a<00:04:46.430> little<00:04:48.400> little<00:04:49.400> 10%<00:04:50.060> hanging<00:04:50.390> out<00:04:50.510> that's

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
a little little 10% hanging out that's

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.620 
a little little 10% hanging out that's
like<00:04:50.840> where<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.200> air<00:04:51.320> pocket<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.270> guess

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
like where the air pocket is so I guess

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.770 
like where the air pocket is so I guess
these<00:04:53.870> all<00:04:54.140> developed<00:04:54.710> correctly<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:58.780> make

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
these all developed correctly and make

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.240 
these all developed correctly and make
sure<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> put<00:05:00.290> it<00:05:00.410> back<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:00.800> there<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.100> right

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
sure I put it back in there the right

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.240 
sure I put it back in there the right
way<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.440> you<00:05:03.440> want<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.650> make<00:05:03.770> sure<00:05:03.950> there's<00:05:04.130> no

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
way and you want to make sure there's no

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.340 
way and you want to make sure there's no
cracks<00:05:04.490> on<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.000> hopefully<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.630> didn't<00:05:05.840> wash<00:05:06.050> off

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
cracks on it hopefully I didn't wash off

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.810 
cracks on it hopefully I didn't wash off
darn<00:05:06.860> circle<00:05:07.460> okay<00:05:08.450> there's<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.840> circle<00:05:09.820> you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
darn circle okay there's the circle you

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.950 
darn circle okay there's the circle you
want<00:05:10.970> make<00:05:11.150> sure<00:05:11.240> there's<00:05:11.420> no<00:05:11.510> cracks<00:05:11.690> in

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
want make sure there's no cracks in

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.090 
want make sure there's no cracks in
there<00:05:12.110> otherwise<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.530> little<00:05:12.740> guys<00:05:12.890> can

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
there otherwise the little guys can

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.430 
there otherwise the little guys can
drown<00:05:13.750> so

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.710 

these<00:05:19.220> three<00:05:19.580> eggs<00:05:19.790> this<00:05:20.090> one<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:20.450> one<00:05:20.630> and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
these three eggs this one this one and

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.990 
these three eggs this one this one and
this<00:05:20.780> one<00:05:20.930> all<00:05:21.340> floated<00:05:22.340> just<00:05:22.550> barely<00:05:22.790> above

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
this one all floated just barely above

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.430 
this one all floated just barely above
and<00:05:23.420> I<00:05:23.450> don't<00:05:23.510> know<00:05:23.720> if<00:05:23.810> they<00:05:23.960> were<00:05:24.020> wiggling

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
and I don't know if they were wiggling

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.590 
and I don't know if they were wiggling
because<00:05:25.010> I<00:05:25.100> put<00:05:25.280> them<00:05:25.370> in<00:05:25.490> there<00:05:25.640> or<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:25.880> this

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
because I put them in there or not this

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.500 
because I put them in there or not this
one<00:05:26.930> didn't<00:05:27.680> float<00:05:28.010> but<00:05:28.760> it's<00:05:28.940> still<00:05:29.180> kind<00:05:29.450> of

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
one didn't float but it's still kind of

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.310 
one didn't float but it's still kind of
lingered<00:05:29.900> in<00:05:30.050> halfway<00:05:30.910> so<00:05:31.910> um<00:05:32.390> see<00:05:33.050> yeah<00:05:33.140> that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
lingered in halfway so um see yeah that

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.520 
lingered in halfway so um see yeah that
was<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.560> float<00:05:33.770> test<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:35.690> I<00:05:36.080> don't<00:05:36.260> know<00:05:36.440> I

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
was the float test and I I don't know I

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.800 
was the float test and I I don't know I
guess<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.950> only<00:05:37.070> thing<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.400> can<00:05:37.550> do<00:05:37.700> is<00:05:37.910> maybe

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
guess the only thing I can do is maybe

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.510 
guess the only thing I can do is maybe
wait<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.080> little<00:05:39.320> bit<00:05:39.470> longer<00:05:39.530> I'd<00:05:40.280> hate<00:05:40.460> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
wait a little bit longer I'd hate to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.240 
wait a little bit longer I'd hate to
start<00:05:40.820> cracking<00:05:41.270> open<00:05:41.390> an<00:05:41.600> egg<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:42.250> they've

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
start cracking open an egg and they've

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.980 
start cracking open an egg and they've
only<00:05:43.370> got<00:05:43.610> a<00:05:43.640> couple<00:05:43.850> drops<00:05:44.180> of<00:05:44.390> blood<00:05:44.600> when

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
only got a couple drops of blood when

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.410 
only got a couple drops of blood when
they're<00:05:45.520> when<00:05:46.520> they're<00:05:46.550> first<00:05:46.880> born<00:05:46.970> and

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
they're when they're first born and

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.060 
they're when they're first born and
stuff<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:47.870> they<00:05:47.990> can<00:05:48.170> the<00:05:48.380> eggs<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.740> actually

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
stuff and they can the eggs can actually

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.800 
stuff and they can the eggs can actually
bleed<00:05:49.280> don't<00:05:49.880> stick<00:05:50.060> your<00:05:50.150> fingers<00:05:50.450> in<00:05:50.480> front

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
bleed don't stick your fingers in front

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.830 
bleed don't stick your fingers in front
of<00:05:50.870> your<00:05:50.990> ocean<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.120> eggs<00:05:53.300> can<00:05:53.480> actually

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
of your ocean the the eggs can actually

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.540 
of your ocean the the eggs can actually
bleed<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.650> they<00:05:54.710> can<00:05:54.860> lose<00:05:55.040> a<00:05:55.070> lot<00:05:55.220> of<00:05:55.370> that

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
bleed and they can lose a lot of that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.050 
bleed and they can lose a lot of that
blood<00:05:55.900> so<00:05:56.900> uh<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.650> yeah<00:05:57.830> I've<00:05:58.220> tired<00:05:58.580> that<00:05:58.730> test

blood so uh so yeah I've tired that test

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.140 
blood so uh so yeah I've tired that test
um<00:06:00.100> it<00:06:01.100> seemed<00:06:01.370> like<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:01.610> work<00:06:01.730> pretty<00:06:01.910> don't

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
I don't know it's just kind of a little

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.910 
I don't know it's just kind of a little
bit<00:06:11.660> depressing<00:06:11.900> you<00:06:12.380> know<00:06:12.470> all<00:06:12.590> that<00:06:12.740> time

bit depressing you know all that time

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160 
bit depressing you know all that time
and<00:06:13.250> all<00:06:13.370> that<00:06:13.520> energy<00:06:13.670> and<00:06:13.910> something<00:06:14.420> I'll

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
and all that energy and something I'll

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.810 
and all that energy and something I'll
look<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.410> humidity<00:06:16.130> went<00:06:16.370> down<00:06:16.520> and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
look to humidity went down and

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.480 
look to humidity went down and
temperature<00:06:17.450> dropped<00:06:17.690> down<00:06:17.810> a<00:06:17.870> sec<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:19.400> know

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
temperature dropped down a sec you know

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.040 
temperature dropped down a sec you know
all<00:06:19.610> that<00:06:19.700> time<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.090> energy<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.630> stuff<00:06:20.870> like

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
all that time and energy and stuff like

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.460 
all that time and energy and stuff like
that<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:21.500> you<00:06:21.620> know<00:06:21.770> um<00:06:22.270> Mesa<00:06:23.270> no<00:06:23.510> boo<00:06:23.720> talked
