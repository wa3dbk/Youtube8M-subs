00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
kind of just a timing thing but is it to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.870 
kind of just a timing thing but is it to
site<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.780> other<00:01:29.050> person<00:01:29.380> out<00:01:29.530> um<00:01:29.860> not<00:01:30.820> that

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
site the other person out um not that

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
site the other person out um not that
not<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.480> know<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.690> it's<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:32.320> just<00:01:32.590> to

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
not that I know of it's really just to

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.890 
not that I know of it's really just to
make<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.130> noise<00:01:33.430> as<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:33.880> hit<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.540> think<00:01:34.810> it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
make that noise as you hit I think it's

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.810 
make that noise as you hit I think it's
just<00:01:35.080> about<00:01:35.170> repetition<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:36.580> about

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
just about repetition it's just about

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.280 
just about repetition it's just about
doing<00:01:36.880> something<00:01:37.330> consistently<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.140> some

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
doing something consistently and some

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.990 
doing something consistently and some
people<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:38.740> just<00:01:39.130> teach<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.670> don't<00:01:39.850> huh

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
people just just teach that I don't huh

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.270 
people just just teach that I don't huh
but<00:01:40.900> that's<00:01:41.080> like<00:01:41.260> an<00:01:41.380> if<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.590> jogger<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.130> went

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
but that's like an if a jogger just went

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.800
