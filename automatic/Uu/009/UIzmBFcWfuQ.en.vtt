00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
draft so it is a little I mean the
device<00:02:15.930> itself<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.650> noticeable<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.640> bulky

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
device itself is noticeable it is bulky

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
device itself is noticeable it is bulky
so<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> probably<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:18.660> find<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> better<00:02:19.140> way

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
so you probably would find a better way

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.070 
so you probably would find a better way
to<00:02:19.410> conceal<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.270> most<00:02:21.510> important

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
to conceal it but the most important

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.550 
to conceal it but the most important
part<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.910> function<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
part of this function is that it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.820 
part of this function is that it
provides<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.670> way<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> deter<00:02:27.870> anyone<00:02:28.200> who<00:02:28.410> wants

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
provides a way to deter anyone who wants

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.980 
provides a way to deter anyone who wants
to<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.070> guess<00:02:29.250> snatch<00:02:29.700> your<00:02:30.000> device<00:02:30.750> out<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
to I guess snatch your device out of

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
to I guess snatch your device out of
your<00:02:31.110> hands<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.530> even<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.190> are<00:02:32.520> scared<00:02:32.850> of

your hands or even if you are scared of
losing<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:34.230> prevents<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.800> because<00:02:35.240> you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
losing it it prevents that because you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.320 
losing it it prevents that because you
know<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.420> works<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:36.870> well<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> security

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
know it works really well as a security

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.030 
know it works really well as a security
device<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.770> show<00:02:40.980> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
just exactly how it works so I'm going

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.050 
just exactly how it works so I'm going
to<00:02:44.820> go<00:02:44.910> ahead<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.060> take<00:02:45.270> our<00:02:46.340> iphone<00:02:47.340> 4<00:02:47.550> right

into the device there you go and then

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.990 
into the device there you go and then
you<00:03:02.400> depress<00:03:04.190> look<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:11.000> there

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you depress look so we can do this there

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.580 
you depress look so we can do this there
you<00:03:12.090> go<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.930> change<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> combinations<00:03:15.590> there

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
you go you change the combinations there

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.850 
you go you change the combinations there

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
you go and it's locked um the reason why

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.930 
you go and it's locked um the reason why
I<00:03:19.890> slipped<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.400> didn't<00:03:20.580> push<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.730> in

already<00:03:26.160> changed<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.580> combination<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.900> not

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
already changed the combination it's not

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.490 
already changed the combination it's not
going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.380> move<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.860> can<00:03:29.990> dangle<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.170> from<00:03:31.320> there
