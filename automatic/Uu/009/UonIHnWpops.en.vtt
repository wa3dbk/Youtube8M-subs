something<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:52.020> they're<00:00:52.170> saying<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> there

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
something what they're saying is there

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
something what they're saying is there
is<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> potential<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.760> winds<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.870> excess<00:00:55.079> of

75 miles per hour hail up to or larger

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
75 miles per hour hail up to or larger
than<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.090> excuse<00:01:00.539> me<00:01:00.719> larger<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.260> two

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
than two excuse me larger than two

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.020 
than two excuse me larger than two
inches<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> diameter<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:03.229> strong<00:01:04.229> tornadoes

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
inches in diameter or strong tornadoes

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.200 
inches in diameter or strong tornadoes
stronger<00:01:06.030> than<00:01:06.180> EF<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.770> Fujita<00:01:08.070> scale

stronger than EF two on the Fujita scale

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.330 
stronger than EF two on the Fujita scale
so<00:01:09.210> obviously<00:01:09.990> whenever<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.189> hatch

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so obviously whenever you got the hatch

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
so obviously whenever you got the hatch
going<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:12.900> thing<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.590> I've

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
going on not a pretty thing so now I've

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.100 
going on not a pretty thing so now I've
gotten<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> couple<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> questions<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.729> on

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
gotten a couple of questions on on

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.880 
gotten a couple of questions on on
Facebook<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.229> some<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> interactions

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
Facebook and some of the interactions

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
Facebook and some of the interactions
could<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> high<00:01:18.540> risk<00:01:18.780> for

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
could it be up to a high risk for

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
could it be up to a high risk for
tomorrow<00:01:19.350> that's<00:01:20.040> possible<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
tomorrow that's possible but you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
tomorrow that's possible but you
understand<00:01:21.630> high<00:01:21.840> risks<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.439> rare

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
understand high risks are very rare

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
understand high risks are very rare
moderate<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.369> probably<00:01:23.790> where<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
moderate is probably where it's going to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
moderate is probably where it's going to
end<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.780> staying<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.470> tomorrow<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
end up staying that tomorrow but it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
end up staying that tomorrow but it
wouldn't<00:01:27.030> surprise<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.390> we'll<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
wouldn't surprise me we'll just have to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140 
wouldn't surprise me we'll just have to
end<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.680> seeing<00:01:28.920> either<00:01:29.189> way<00:01:29.460> though<00:01:29.670> whether

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
end up seeing either way though whether

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
end up seeing either way though whether
it<00:01:30.329> stays<00:01:30.570> moderate<00:01:31.110> whether<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> goes<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it stays moderate whether it goes to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
it stays moderate whether it goes to
high<00:01:32.100> risk<00:01:32.310> tomorrow<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> a

large hail

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.199

we'll have to keep an eye on that but

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.550 
we'll have to keep an eye on that but
you<00:04:44.610> see<00:04:44.820> damaging<00:04:45.720> winds<00:04:45.900> moving<00:04:46.320> through<00:04:46.530> a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
you see damaging winds moving through a

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.700 
you see damaging winds moving through a
good<00:04:46.920> chunk<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.670> area<00:04:47.700> there<00:04:48.330> as<00:04:48.540> well<00:04:48.870> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
good chunk of the area there as well and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.590 
good chunk of the area there as well and
then<00:04:50.010> behind<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.430> we<00:04:51.030> get<00:04:51.150> another<00:04:51.360> round

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
then behind that we get another round

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.450 
then behind that we get another round
that<00:04:51.840> forms<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.290> also<00:04:52.440> forms<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:52.980> third<00:04:53.220> round

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
that forms it also forms the third round

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.280 
that forms it also forms the third round
but<00:04:53.670> by<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.910> time<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.270> gets<00:04:54.360> here<00:04:54.630> it's<00:04:55.050> during

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
but by the time it gets here it's during

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.870 
but by the time it gets here it's during
the<00:04:55.350> overnight<00:04:55.590> hours<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.520> nothing

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
the overnight hours and so it's nothing

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.820 
the overnight hours and so it's nothing
to<00:04:56.970> be<00:04:57.120> worried<00:04:57.810> about<00:04:57.990> there<00:04:58.290> at<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> point

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
to be worried about there at that point

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.540 
to be worried about there at that point
so<00:04:59.400> again<00:04:59.430> two<00:05:00.240> models<00:05:00.690> two<00:05:01.370> different<00:05:02.370> ideas

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
so again two models two different ideas

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.310 
so again two models two different ideas
and<00:05:02.910> what<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.180> could<00:05:03.330> take<00:05:03.510> either<00:05:04.080> one<00:05:04.290> of

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
and what you could take either one of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.830 
and what you could take either one of
these<00:05:04.470> are<00:05:04.680> solid<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.340> fact<00:05:05.670> yet<00:05:05.940> folks<00:05:06.570> we're
