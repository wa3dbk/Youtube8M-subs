for<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> rest<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> our

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
for that but I think the rest of our

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440 
for that but I think the rest of our
parts<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.079> cool<00:00:40.520> we<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.610> Molly<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.270> think

we've<00:02:47.849> started<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.599> windshield<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.349> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
we've started on the windshield but I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.140 
we've started on the windshield but I
think<00:02:49.769> we're<00:02:50.040> gonna<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.819> regroup<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
think we're gonna have to regroup here I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.819 
think we're gonna have to regroup here I
can't<00:02:54.150> start<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> bottom<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
can't start it in the bottom because it

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.400 
can't start it in the bottom because it
hits<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.370> portion<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.599> roof<00:02:57.810> he

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
hits that portion there on the roof he

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.280 
hits that portion there on the roof he
says<00:02:58.680> my<00:02:58.980> suspicion<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.900> think<00:03:00.959> what<00:03:01.200> we

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
says my suspicion so I think what we

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.990 
says my suspicion so I think what we
need<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.860> flip<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> windshield<00:03:02.760> back

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
need to do is flip the windshield back

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.009 
need to do is flip the windshield back
down<00:03:07.370> wire<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.879> comes<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.599> center

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
down wire so it comes out in the center

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.309 
down wire so it comes out in the center
at<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.170> top<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.660> turn<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.840> windshield<00:03:13.079> and

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
at the top and turn the windshield and

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.470 
at the top and turn the windshield and
started<00:03:13.769> at<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> top<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.549> work<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.209> from

started at the top and work it in from
the<00:03:15.599> bottom<00:03:16.549> that's<00:03:17.549> what<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> think<00:03:18.090> that's

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
the bottom that's what I think that's

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.270
