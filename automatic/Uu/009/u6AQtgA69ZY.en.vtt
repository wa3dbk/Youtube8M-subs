in the sunlight

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.630 
in the sunlight
it's<00:01:03.890> very<00:01:04.159> spring<00:01:04.699> I<00:01:05.000> think<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.630> looks<00:01:05.810> very

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640

is a little bit of fresh spring color so

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.960 
is a little bit of fresh spring color so
we<00:01:14.990> put<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.229> terracotta<00:01:15.710> skin<00:01:16.520> illuminator

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and this makes all of the pores totally

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.860 
and this makes all of the pores totally
disappear<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.860> blots<00:02:14.280> excess<00:02:15.210> oil<00:02:15.570> all

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
we're seeing this spring is a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.730 
we're seeing this spring is a
continuation<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:42.080> smokey<00:03:43.080> done<00:03:43.500> up<00:03:43.620> eye

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
continuation of the smokey done up eye

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.150

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
higher towards orbital Ridge just like

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.290 
higher towards orbital Ridge just like
that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300
