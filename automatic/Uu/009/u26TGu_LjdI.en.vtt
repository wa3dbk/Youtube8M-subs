00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.180 

I<00:00:11.240> think<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.480> come<00:00:12.719> into<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.860> little

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
I think when you come into this little

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
I think when you come into this little
corner<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.210> Brussels<00:00:15.630> Square

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
corner of Brussels Square

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
corner of Brussels Square
so<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.250> immediately<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.119> feeling

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so as you immediately get this feeling

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.859 
so as you immediately get this feeling
that<00:00:18.600> there's<00:00:18.900> something<00:00:19.080> unusual<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.710> on

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
that there's something unusual going on

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
that there's something unusual going on
whether<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.020> people<00:00:22.590> sitting<00:00:23.039> out<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.189> front

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
whether it's people sitting out in front

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
whether it's people sitting out in front
or<00:00:24.000> whether<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.869> lines<00:00:25.439> waiting<00:00:25.949> for

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
or whether it's the lines waiting for

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.689 
or whether it's the lines waiting for
the<00:00:26.369> free<00:00:27.210> meal<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.779> lunchtime<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:29.550> know

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the free meal at lunchtime or you know

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
the free meal at lunchtime or you know
in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> evenings<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.109> kind<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
in the evenings there's this kind of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.310 
in the evenings there's this kind of
pulse<00:00:31.890> coming<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> building<00:00:33.320> there's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
pulse coming out of the building there's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.950 
pulse coming out of the building there's
something<00:00:34.680> always<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> ice<00:00:39.629> has

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
something always going on so ice has

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.850 
something always going on so ice has
probably<00:00:41.030> made<00:00:42.030> me<00:00:42.329> more<00:00:42.540> critical<00:00:42.899> about

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
probably made me more critical about

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430 
probably made me more critical about
pretty<00:00:44.370> much<00:00:44.489> everything<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.570> given<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pretty much everything it's given me so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
pretty much everything it's given me so
much<00:00:46.620> more<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.039> international<00:00:47.370> focus<00:00:47.640> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
much more of an international focus it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
much more of an international focus it's
helped<00:00:48.629> me<00:00:48.780> ground<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.530> idealism

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
helped me ground a lot of my idealism

helped me ground a lot of my idealism
and<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.180> realistic

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and make it more of a realistic

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
and make it more of a realistic
possibility<00:00:52.230> people<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.460> different

cultures have different norms different

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
cultures have different norms different
values<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.430> open<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.820> mind<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> force

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

about<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> world<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> live<00:01:06.570> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
about the world I live in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
about the world I live in
overall<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.530> given<00:01:07.799> me<00:01:07.860> confidence<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.580> Who

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
overall it's given me confidence in Who

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
overall it's given me confidence in Who
I<00:01:08.820> am<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> believe<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> us

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I am and in what I believe it so us

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
I am and in what I believe it so us
became<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.979> huge<00:01:11.310> gateway<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> places<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
became this huge gateway to places I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
became this huge gateway to places I
never<00:01:12.990> thought<00:01:13.380> I'd<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.590> part<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.280> students

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
never thought I'd be part of as students

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
never thought I'd be part of as students
leave<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:15.840> graduate<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.710> they're

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
leave so as as they graduate as they're

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
leave so as as they graduate as they're
standing<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> threshold<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.659> out

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
standing on the threshold of going out

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
standing on the threshold of going out
into<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> world<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:20.009> informed<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> more

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
into the world as more informed and more

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.690 
into the world as more informed and more
able<00:01:21.259> citizens<00:01:22.259> than<00:01:23.009> before

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
able citizens than before

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
able citizens than before
I<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.600> experience<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I think the so as experience is one of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.320 
I think the so as experience is one of
those<00:01:25.680> things<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.729> crossing<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
those things that make this crossing of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.140 
those things that make this crossing of
the<00:01:27.360> threshold<00:01:27.950> something<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.430> doable

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the threshold something which is doable

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.819 
the threshold something which is doable
and<00:01:30.509> above<00:01:31.140> Ward<00:01:31.439> enjoyable

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.569 

the<00:01:36.390> range<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:38.219> things<00:01:39.219> that<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.369> can<00:01:39.490> do

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
the range of things that you can do

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.969 
the range of things that you can do
outside<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:39.969> your<00:01:40.210> studies<00:01:40.649> last<00:01:41.649> year<00:01:41.829> I<00:01:41.859> went

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
outside of your studies last year I went

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.760 
outside of your studies last year I went

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
a certain a worker so I suppose music

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
a certain a worker so I suppose music
way<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.819> really<00:01:48.939> nice<00:01:49.179> environment<00:01:49.509> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
way it's a really nice environment to
