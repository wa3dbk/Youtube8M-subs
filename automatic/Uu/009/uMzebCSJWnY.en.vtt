00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the angles and all come to realize that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.429 
the angles and all come to realize that
up<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.010> towards<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> front<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.409> see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.969 
cutting these two bars a little too long
I<00:01:20.220> wasn't<00:01:21.030> paying<00:01:21.150> attention<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.590> I've

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I wasn't paying attention so now I've

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
got oh actually they're a little bit

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.140 
got oh actually they're a little bit
over<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.070> I've<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.460> big<00:01:26.640> gap<00:01:26.850> right

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
over but now I've got this big gap right

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.260 
over but now I've got this big gap right
here<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:30.060> gap

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here so what I'm going to do is this gap

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
here so what I'm going to do is this gap
right<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> half-inch<00:01:31.229> gap<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.490> I'm

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
right here is a half-inch gap so I'm

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
right here is a half-inch gap so I'm
going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> measure<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:33.930> two<00:01:34.140> bars<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
going to measure up these two bars here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.240 
going to measure up these two bars here
and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> turn<00:01:37.350> off<00:01:37.560> using<00:01:38.100> my

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and then I'm going to turn off using my

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
and then I'm going to turn off using my
cutting<00:01:38.579> wheels<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> cut<00:01:40.079> off<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
cutting wheels I'm going to cut off a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.069 
cutting wheels I'm going to cut off a
half-inch<00:01:40.829> right<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.780> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> makes<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
half-inch right here kind of makes me a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
half-inch right here kind of makes me a
little<00:01:43.170> mad<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.000> even<00:01:45.000> I've<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
little mad because I even I've got the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.530 
little mad because I even I've got the
plan<00:01:45.930> sitting<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.470> front<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.829> me<00:01:46.920> too<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
I'll be there for my chop saw I cut

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.500 
I'll be there for my chop saw I cut
these<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.270> now

once I get that done I'll be then doing
the<00:01:55.660> back<00:01:55.930> support<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:58.260> from<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.350> back

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
support I'll be doing another frame

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.690 
support I'll be doing another frame
exactly<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.840> outside<00:02:05.440> part<00:02:05.830> that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
exactly like this the outside part that

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.359 
exactly like this the outside part that
will<00:02:06.850> be<00:02:06.970> cut<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.450> coming<00:02:08.080> down<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.649> taper<00:02:09.010> in

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
will be cut and coming down and taper in

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.720 
will be cut and coming down and taper in
like<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.680> so<00:02:11.680> we're<00:02:12.010> going<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.190> have<00:02:12.430> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
like that and so we're going to have a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.260 
like that and so we're going to have a
dual<00:02:13.570> frame<00:02:14.290> type<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.800> thing<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.250> okay<00:02:15.910> guys

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
dual frame type of thing here okay guys

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.040 
dual frame type of thing here okay guys
I've<00:02:16.660> got<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.020> frame<00:02:17.860> outside<00:02:18.870> cooling<00:02:19.870> off

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
I've got the frame outside cooling off

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.490 
I've got the frame outside cooling off
and<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:21.280> thought<00:02:21.520> what<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> would<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.540> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
looky good it's actually turned out a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.940 
looky good it's actually turned out a
lot<00:03:59.760> better<00:03:59.910> than<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.150> expected<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:03.950> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
lot better than I expected it to the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.720 
lot better than I expected it to the
worlds<00:04:05.310> are<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.520> nice<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.490> when<00:04:08.640> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
worlds are all nice and but when you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.480 
worlds are all nice and but when you
grind<00:04:08.910> down<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> weld<00:04:09.590> sometimes<00:04:10.590> depending

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
grind down a weld sometimes depending

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.510 
grind down a weld sometimes depending
upon<00:04:11.580> how<00:04:12.260> much<00:04:13.260> penetrated<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.160> steel

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
upon how much penetrated the steel

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.460 
upon how much penetrated the steel
sometimes<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.420> weld<00:04:15.660> won't<00:04:15.870> hold<00:04:16.079> middle

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
sometimes the weld won't hold middle

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.660 
sometimes the weld won't hold middle
crack<00:04:17.359> we'll<00:04:18.359> find<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.720> out<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:20.220> hard<00:04:20.250> way

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
crack we'll find that out the hard way

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.100 
crack we'll find that out the hard way

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
them too long so and I didn't realize
