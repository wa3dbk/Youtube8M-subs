hi this is dr. Karen Becker and today
we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.310> discuss<00:00:02.760> struvite<00:00:03.449> stones

to<00:00:21.539> form<00:00:21.720> crystals<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.529> irritate<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to form crystals that can irritate and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
to form crystals that can irritate and
inflame<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> bladder<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> crystals

inflame the bladder when the crystals

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.259 
inflame the bladder when the crystals
combine<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.769> mucus<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> form<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.970> plug
