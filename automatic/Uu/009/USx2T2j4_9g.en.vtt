the thing that I find very ironic about

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.340

the<00:01:43.900> American<00:01:44.470> rejection<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.190> soccer<00:01:45.490> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the American rejection of soccer and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.240 
the American rejection of soccer and
particularly<00:01:47.350> within<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.920> media<00:01:48.400> is<00:01:48.700> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
particularly within the media is that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.340 
particularly within the media is that
basically<00:01:51.250> American<00:01:51.780> culture<00:01:52.780> consumer

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
basically American culture consumer

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.760 
basically American culture consumer
culture<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:54.040> predicated<00:01:54.490> on<00:01:54.900> an<00:01:55.900> insatiable

culture is predicated on an insatiable
desire<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.760> consume<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.650> high

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
desire to consume because the high

desire to consume because the high
fructose<00:02:00.160> corn<00:02:00.430> syrup<00:02:00.820> that's<00:02:01.330> in<00:02:01.510> all<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.930> our

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
fructose corn syrup that's in all of our

always<00:02:07.510> having<00:02:07.750> cravings<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:10.300> complaint

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
always having cravings and the complaint

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.260 
always having cravings and the complaint
about<00:02:10.840> soccer<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:12.370> there's<00:02:12.610> no<00:02:12.790> scoring

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
about soccer is that there's no scoring

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.850 
about soccer is that there's no scoring
there's<00:02:13.660> no<00:02:13.870> payoff<00:02:14.170> there's<00:02:14.650> no

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
there's no payoff there's no

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.430 
there's no payoff there's no
satisfaction<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.420> feel<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.110> would

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
satisfaction but I feel like that would

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.020 
satisfaction but I feel like that would
be<00:02:17.470> something<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> American<00:02:18.640> media

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
be something that the American media

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.240 
be something that the American media
would<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.660> promote<00:02:20.020> with<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.890> sport

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
would want to promote with the sport

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.640 
would want to promote with the sport
because<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:22.060> basically<00:02:22.600> they<00:02:23.050> are<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.380> all

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
because then basically they are all all

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.800 
because then basically they are all all
the<00:02:24.100> viewers<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.459> soccer<00:02:24.850> are<00:02:25.510> still

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the viewers of soccer are still

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.630 
the viewers of soccer are still
unsatisfied<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.800> should<00:02:27.010> want<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.459> out

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
unsatisfied and should want to go out

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.600 
unsatisfied and should want to go out
and<00:02:27.910> consume<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.810> carry<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.100> American

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
and consume and carry on the American

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.050 
and consume and carry on the American
Way

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:49.520 

my<00:02:34.060> USA<00:02:34.810> USA<00:02:35.800> USA<00:02:37.650> World<00:02:38.650> Cup

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.800 

I<00:02:50.530> think<00:02:51.130> Americans<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.970> sportswear<00:02:52.660> they

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
I think Americans like sportswear they

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.370 
I think Americans like sportswear they
fabricate<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> lot<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.950> scoring<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:55.380> soccer

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
fabricate a lot of scoring and soccer

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.559 
fabricate a lot of scoring and soccer
it's<00:02:56.830> more<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.850> sort<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.209> approach

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
it's more you have to sort of approach

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.630 
it's more you have to sort of approach
it<00:02:58.780> more<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.740> chess<00:02:59.980> game<00:03:00.010> that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
it more as the chess game that's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.870 
it more as the chess game that's
continuously<00:03:01.360> going<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.640> inevitably<00:03:03.640> you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
continuously going and inevitably you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.340 
continuously going and inevitably you
hope<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:04.570> lead<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.080> goal

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.410 

you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.620 

yeah<00:03:17.380> I<00:03:17.440> think<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:18.100> primary<00:03:18.370> soccer<00:03:18.940> fan<00:03:19.300> in

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
yeah I think the primary soccer fan in

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.140 
yeah I think the primary soccer fan in
the<00:03:19.780> US<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.890> would<00:03:21.070> call<00:03:21.460> more<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
the US is what I would call more of the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.100 
the US is what I would call more of the
Euro<00:03:22.420> snob<00:03:22.840> soccer<00:03:23.620> fan

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
Euro snob soccer fan

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.470 
Euro snob soccer fan
they<00:03:26.110> don't<00:03:26.530> really<00:03:26.920> regard<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.000> quality<00:03:28.390> of

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
they don't really regard the quality of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.500 
they don't really regard the quality of
soccer<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.140> United<00:03:29.320> States<00:03:29.920> as<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:31.150> high

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
soccer in the United States as that high

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.100 
soccer in the United States as that high
or<00:03:31.840> oppressive<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:33.240> they're<00:03:34.240> generally<00:03:34.690> fans

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
or oppressive and they're generally fans

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.950 
or oppressive and they're generally fans
of<00:03:35.500> Manchester<00:03:36.340> United<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.000> rail<00:03:37.270> Madrid<00:03:37.750> or

exclusively the European leagues but me

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.780 
exclusively the European leagues but me
I<00:03:44.380> always<00:03:44.830> think<00:03:45.070> these<00:03:45.160> people<00:03:45.340> are<00:03:45.550> very

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I always think these people are very

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.040 
I always think these people are very
foolish<00:03:46.060> because<00:03:46.390> what<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.780> don't<00:03:46.990> realize

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
foolish because what they don't realize

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.530 
foolish because what they don't realize
is<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:48.130> if<00:03:48.490> they<00:03:48.640> did<00:03:48.880> actually<00:03:49.120> give<00:03:49.510> some

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
is that if they did actually give some
