00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
of that island there so what I do first

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.420 
of that island there so what I do first
is<00:00:52.730> get<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.390> end<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.780> pole<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:55.280> the

is get to the end of the pole to the
correct<00:00:55.820> distance<00:00:56.239> then<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.110> want<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.320> drop

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
correct distance then you want to drop

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.420 
correct distance then you want to drop
that<00:00:57.860> bit<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.510> pellet<00:00:59.510> ball<00:00:59.720> into<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.530> peg<00:01:00.769> so

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that bit of pellet ball into the peg so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.759 
that bit of pellet ball into the peg so
turn<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.879> pole<00:01:02.090> round<00:01:02.420> give<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.470> bit<00:01:03.620> of<00:01:03.710> a

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
turn the pole round give it a bit of a

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.190 
turn the pole round give it a bit of a
tap<00:01:04.009> there<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.119> go<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:05.960> want<00:01:06.140> to

tap there you go and now you want to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.950 
tap there you go and now you want to

that's<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.080> good<00:02:16.230> reason<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.740> using<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that's a good reason for using a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's a good reason for using a
barbless<00:02:17.340> hook<00:02:18.080> when<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.170> catch<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.640> yeah

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
barbless hook when you catch it yeah

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
barbless hook when you catch it yeah
right<00:02:23.100> that's<00:02:23.310> seven<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.730> go

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
right that's seven there we go

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
so we'll load up with a bit another

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.770 
so we'll load up with a bit another
consignment<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.070> micro<00:02:29.070> pellets<00:02:29.780> and

in and repeat the process seems like a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.420 
in and repeat the process seems like a
bit<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.420> faff<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.070> best<00:03:05.280> way

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
bit of a faff but it's just the best way

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
bit of a faff but it's just the best way
to<00:03:05.580> feed<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.360> peg<00:03:06.570> nice<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.050> gradually<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
to feed the peg nice and gradually and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.610 
to feed the peg nice and gradually and
build<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.980> up<00:03:13.550> that's<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:15.200> nicely<00:03:16.200> done

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
build it up that's it nicely done

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
build it up that's it nicely done
I<00:03:16.650> mean<00:03:17.550> obviously<00:03:17.670> when<00:03:18.660> you've<00:03:18.810> done<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.960> a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
I mean obviously when you've done it a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.030 
I mean obviously when you've done it a
few<00:03:19.320> more<00:03:19.500> times

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
few more times

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500 
few more times
jab<00:03:20.370> you'll<00:03:20.550> find<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.209> speed<00:03:21.480> up

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
jab you'll find that you can speed up

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.660 
jab you'll find that you can speed up
the<00:03:21.810> process<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:23.070> what<00:03:23.250> you're<00:03:23.370> doing<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
the process but what you're doing is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.860 
the process but what you're doing is
absolutely<00:03:23.850> spot-on<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:26.360> drop<00:03:27.360> your<00:03:27.510> pellet

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
absolutely spot-on so drop your pellet

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
absolutely spot-on so drop your pellet
in<00:03:27.989> we're<00:03:28.350> lined<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.890> yep<00:03:31.250> there<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
in we're lined up yep there you go and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.120 
in we're lined up yep there you go and
then<00:03:33.690> lower<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.170> rig<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:34.830> get<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
then lower your rig in so you get the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.640 
then lower your rig in so you get the
optimum<00:03:35.550> presentation<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.350> way<00:03:37.470> you're

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
optimum presentation and the way you're

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.020 
optimum presentation and the way you're
holding<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:38.070> poll<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.550> shows<00:03:38.820> absolutely

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
holding the poll that shows absolutely

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.990 
holding the poll that shows absolutely
spot-on<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.920> need<00:03:41.250> your<00:03:41.580> leg<00:03:41.760> here

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
spot-on you need your leg here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.640 
spot-on you need your leg here
supporting<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.660> bulk<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.140> pole<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
supporting the bulk of the pole and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.850 
supporting the bulk of the pole and
you're<00:03:43.739> able<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.040> control<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.410> pole<00:03:46.650> and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
you're able to control the pole and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.280 
you're able to control the pole and
strike<00:03:47.160> very<00:03:47.400> efficiently<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.900> strikes

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
strike very efficiently and that strikes

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.290 
strike very efficiently and that strikes
just<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.680> gentle<00:03:50.130> lift<00:03:50.370> isn't<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.790> true<00:03:51.030> yeah

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
just a gentle lift isn't it true yeah

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.850 
just a gentle lift isn't it true yeah
you're<00:03:51.630> not<00:03:51.750> striking<00:03:52.230> too<00:03:52.440> hard<00:03:52.680> because

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
you're not striking too hard because

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.979 
you're not striking too hard because
you've<00:03:53.100> got<00:03:53.310> such<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.520> short<00:03:53.820> length<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.390> line

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
you've got such a short length of line

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.320 
you've got such a short length of line
between<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.620> pole<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.670> float<00:03:56.970> there's

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
between the pole and the float there's

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.229 
between the pole and the float there's
no<00:03:57.480> need<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:58.340> strong<00:03:59.340> strike<00:03:59.730> it's<00:04:00.000> more<00:04:00.150> of

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
no need for a strong strike it's more of

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.300 
no need for a strong strike it's more of
a<00:04:00.330> lift<00:04:00.570> really<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.170> mean<00:04:01.350> even<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.070> like

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
a lift really I mean even with just like

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.699 
a lift really I mean even with just like
the<00:04:02.550> first<00:04:02.820> put<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.540> you're<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.470> much<00:04:04.680> in

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the first put in you're so much in

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.350 
the first put in you're so much in
control<00:04:05.100> yeah<00:04:05.970> what's<00:04:06.510> happening

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.330 

you're<00:04:13.140> doing<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.770> nice<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.220> one

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
you're doing that really nice and one

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.890 
you're doing that really nice and one
thing<00:04:14.550> I'll<00:04:14.700> say<00:04:14.730> trove<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:15.510> every<00:04:15.750> so

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
thing I'll say trove is just every so

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.680 
thing I'll say trove is just every so
often<00:04:16.110> just<00:04:16.470> lift<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.860> float<00:04:17.160> out<00:04:17.459> maybe<00:04:18.299> 4<00:04:18.660> or

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
often just lift the float out maybe 4 or

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.560 
often just lift the float out maybe 4 or
5<00:04:18.900> centimeters<00:04:19.860> out<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.459> water<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:21.030> then

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
5 centimeters out the water and then

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.690 
5 centimeters out the water and then
lower<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.989> back<00:04:22.290> in<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.590> game<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.520> what

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
lower it back in the game and what

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.670 
lower it back in the game and what
that's<00:04:23.880> doing<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.570> bringing<00:04:25.560> your

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
that's doing is it's just bringing your

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.900 
that's doing is it's just bringing your
pellet<00:04:26.010> off<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> bottom<00:04:26.670> and<00:04:26.820> then

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
pellet off the bottom and then

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.590 
pellet off the bottom and then
enticingly<00:04:27.650> falling<00:04:28.650> back<00:04:28.830> down<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:30.420> many

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
enticingly falling back down and so many

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.970 
enticingly falling back down and so many
times<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.740> bite

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
times you do that and you get a bite

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:46.360 
times you do that and you get a bite
straightaway

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.150 

Oh<00:04:46.870> bit<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.900> an<00:04:48.050> indication<00:04:48.290> there<00:04:48.830> and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
Oh bit of an indication there and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.340 
Oh bit of an indication there and
actually<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:50.540> did<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> right<00:04:50.990> thing<00:04:51.260> because

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
actually you did the right thing because

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.960 
actually you did the right thing because
he<00:04:51.530> didn't<00:04:51.800> take<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.100> float<00:04:52.310> underneath<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.940> I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
he didn't take the float underneath it I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.879 
he didn't take the float underneath it I
mean<00:04:53.120> we've<00:04:53.300> got<00:04:53.449> that<00:04:53.630> float<00:04:53.960> darted<00:04:54.440> down<00:04:54.470> to

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
mean we've got that float darted down to

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.800 
mean we've got that float darted down to
perfection<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.520> it's<00:04:55.790> so<00:04:55.970> sensitive<00:04:56.300> that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
perfection so it's so sensitive that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.230 
perfection so it's so sensitive that
might<00:04:57.320> have<00:04:57.470> been<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.650> fish<00:04:57.949> just<00:04:58.240> rubbing

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
might have been a fish just rubbing

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.560 
might have been a fish just rubbing
against<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.780> line<00:05:00.020> or<00:05:00.410> just<00:05:00.440> Marvin<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.160> bait

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
against the line or just Marvin the bait

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.790 
against the line or just Marvin the bait
but<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.660> great<00:05:02.870> thing<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.139> you<00:05:03.380> were<00:05:03.470> able<00:05:03.770> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
but the great thing is you were able to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.200 
but the great thing is you were able to
get<00:05:04.040> straight<00:05:04.280> back<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.669> again<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.120> you're

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
get straight back in again and you're

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.129 
get straight back in again and you're
fishing<00:05:05.479> in<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.660> same<00:05:05.870> spot<00:05:06.229> aren't<00:05:06.500> you

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
fishing in the same spot aren't you

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:17.450 
fishing in the same spot aren't you
that's<00:05:09.139> okay<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.710> still<00:05:09.740> got<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.190> peloton

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.189 

nicely<00:05:18.389> done

you're having to strike through the

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.040 
you're having to strike through the
float<00:05:40.469> to<00:05:40.680> get<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.129> fish<00:05:41.629> so<00:05:42.629> if<00:05:42.749> you<00:05:42.870> can

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
float to get to the fish so if you can

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.080 
float to get to the fish so if you can
try<00:05:43.259> and<00:05:43.409> next<00:05:43.650> time<00:05:43.800> if<00:05:43.889> we<00:05:44.009> get<00:05:44.129> a<00:05:44.189> bite<00:05:44.400> just

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
try and next time if we get a bite just

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:59.350 
try and next time if we get a bite just
lift<00:05:45.360> directly<00:05:45.930> up

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.980 

that<00:06:00.360> was<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.509> good<00:06:00.720> strike<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:02.870> think<00:06:03.870> we'll

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
that was a good strike I think we'll

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.060

and if we don't hit a bite we should try

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.770 
and if we don't hit a bite we should try
