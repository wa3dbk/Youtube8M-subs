similar<00:00:44.390> but<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:44.840> think<00:00:45.020> it's<00:00:45.140> called<00:00:45.350> back

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
similar but I think it's called back

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
differences so first I'll start with

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.920 
differences so first I'll start with
this<00:00:52.790> on<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.090> tee<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:54.290> was<00:00:54.700> I<00:00:55.700> think<00:00:56.030> 98<00:00:56.450> yen<00:00:56.890> so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
this on a tee this was I think 98 yen so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.290 
this on a tee this was I think 98 yen so
pretty<00:00:59.930> inexpensive<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.000> they're<00:01:02.000> sold<00:01:02.180> out

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
like I said there's tons of different

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.999 
like I said there's tons of different
flavors<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.300> is<00:01:17.420> how<00:01:17.539> its<00:01:17.750> wrapped<00:01:18.009> and

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
flavors so this is how its wrapped and

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.820 
flavors so this is how its wrapped and
like<00:01:19.640> most<00:01:19.880> Japanese<00:01:20.390> packaging<00:01:20.929> it's<00:01:21.170> very

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
like most Japanese packaging it's very

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.949 
like most Japanese packaging it's very
clearly<00:01:22.539> labeled<00:01:23.539> on<00:01:23.750> how<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.679> open<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.959> top

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
clearly labeled on how to open it top

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.260 
clearly labeled on how to open it top
there's<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.440> number<00:01:27.740> one<00:01:29.440> one<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.880> on<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.060> side

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
there's a number one one and on the side

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.219 
there's a number one one and on the side
there's<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:32.750> number<00:01:33.020> two<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:35.000> number<00:01:35.229> three

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
there's a number two and a number three

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.510 
there's a number two and a number three
on<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.429> bottom<00:01:37.550> there's<00:01:38.000> full<00:01:38.270> instructions

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
on the bottom there's full instructions

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.219 
on the bottom there's full instructions
so<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.300> reason<00:01:41.599> why<00:01:41.720> there's<00:01:41.959> all<00:01:42.110> this

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
so the reason why there's all this

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.440 
so the reason why there's all this
packaging<00:01:42.800> look<00:01:43.310> as<00:01:43.459> for<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.789> it's<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.300> keep

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
packaging look as for this it's to keep

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.320 
packaging look as for this it's to keep
the<00:01:44.509> noir<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> crisp<00:01:45.610> lenore--<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.090> seaweed

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
the noir a crisp lenore-- is the seaweed

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.889 
the noir a crisp lenore-- is the seaweed
the<00:01:47.840> black<00:01:48.080> green<00:01:48.830> seaweed<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:50.630> keep<00:01:50.780> it

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
the black green seaweed to keep it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.900 
the black green seaweed to keep it
separated<00:01:51.259> from<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.619> rice<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.250> once<00:01:52.700> the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
separated from the rice and once the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.270 
separated from the rice and once the
nori<00:01:53.149> gets<00:01:53.450> wet<00:01:53.750> or<00:01:54.110> damp<00:01:54.410> or<00:01:54.709> touches<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
nori gets wet or damp or touches the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.059 
nori gets wet or damp or touches the
rice<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.270> gets<00:01:56.509> soft<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.470> little<00:01:57.679> bit<00:01:57.800> chewy

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
rice it gets soft and a little bit chewy

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.180 
rice it gets soft and a little bit chewy
and<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.000> first<00:01:59.780> pull<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.590> tab<00:02:01.300> down<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.190> it

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
and so first pull this tab down and it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.430 
and so first pull this tab down and it
cuts<00:02:04.489> the<00:02:04.640> plastic<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.539> tear<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.020> through

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
cuts the plastic and you tear it through

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.309 
cuts the plastic and you tear it through
the<00:02:06.860> label<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.789> then<00:02:08.300> trick<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.840> tear<00:02:09.200> it

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
the label and then trick is to tear it

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:17.910 
the label and then trick is to tear it
all<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.709> way<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:10.360> find<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.200> back

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.350 

so<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.460> challenge<00:02:19.640> birth<00:02:20.030> tip

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
so it's kind of a challenge birth tip

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.870 
so it's kind of a challenge birth tip
through<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.990> label<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:24.730> comes<00:02:25.730> all

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
through this label to the back comes all

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.500 
through this label to the back comes all
the<00:02:25.970> way<00:02:26.090> off

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the way off

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.420 
the way off
so<00:02:27.380> essentially<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:27.740> you've<00:02:27.890> done<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.250> rip

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
so essentially what you've done is rip

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.090 
so essentially what you've done is rip
the<00:02:28.580> plastic<00:02:28.820> cut<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> plastic<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:30.110> half<00:02:30.320> then

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
the plastic cut the plastic in half then

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460 
the plastic cut the plastic in half then
you<00:02:31.220> take<00:02:31.400> number<00:02:31.670> two<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.300> pull<00:02:33.260> this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
you take number two and you pull this

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.080 
you take number two and you pull this
corner<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.660> start<00:02:35.660> pulling<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.850> hold

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
corner you start pulling it and you hold

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.520 
corner you start pulling it and you hold
on<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.750> what<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.020> does<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.350> it's

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
on to this so what it does is it's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.460 
on to this so what it does is it's
pulling<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.100> plastic<00:02:40.730> off<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.990> nori<00:02:42.230> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
pulling this plastic off of the nori and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.870 
pulling this plastic off of the nori and
the<00:02:43.040> nori<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:45.130> separated<00:02:46.130> from<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.310> rice<00:02:46.580> so

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
the nori is separated from the rice so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.250 
the nori is separated from the rice so
as<00:02:47.030> you're<00:02:47.209> pulling<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:53.600> getting<00:02:53.810> in

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
as you're pulling it it's getting in

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:04.240 
as you're pulling it it's getting in
contact<00:02:54.530> with<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.130> rice<00:02:59.080> so<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.590> rice<00:03:03.830> is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
contact with the rice so now the rice is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.900 
contact with the rice so now the rice is
touching<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.260> all<00:03:06.440> right<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.250> wrap<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.489> close

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
touching and all right you wrap it close

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.640 
touching and all right you wrap it close
and<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> same<00:03:09.170> thing<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.770> side

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
and do the same thing on this side

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:26.080 
and do the same thing on this side
and<00:03:12.650> pull<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:19.690> if<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.680> go<00:03:25.090> see

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
and pull it if it's there you go see

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.070 
and pull it if it's there you go see
there's<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.420> good<00:03:26.600> shot

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
there's a good shot

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.840 
there's a good shot
see<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:27.769> sounding<00:03:28.070> between<00:03:28.340> two<00:03:28.489> pieces<00:03:28.670> of

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
see it's sounding between two pieces of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.620 
see it's sounding between two pieces of
plastic<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:30.080> when<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.260> pull<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.620> it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
plastic and so when you pull it it

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.810 
plastic and so when you pull it it
releases<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:36.410> nori

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
releases it and you have the nori

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.789 
releases it and you have the nori
touching<00:03:37.820> nice<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.989> then<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.230> wrap<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.650> up

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
touching nice so then you wrap it up

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.580 
touching nice so then you wrap it up
again<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:41.390> then<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.720> have<00:03:41.750> your<00:03:41.959> triangle

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
again and then you have your triangle

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.340 
again and then you have your triangle

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590

you the other one too so that's a B Mayo
what<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.250> gave<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.690> yes<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.860> concept<00:04:33.190> is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
what I gave you yes but the concept is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.710 
what I gave you yes but the concept is
same<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:34.020> um<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> separate<00:04:37.539> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
same is um you have to separate the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.439 
same is um you have to separate the
plastic<00:04:38.169> or<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> plastic<00:04:39.120> separates<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
plastic or the plastic separates the

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.750 
plastic or the plastic separates the
nori<00:04:40.750> from<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.440> rice<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.370> in<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.550> case

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
nori from the rice so in this case

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.000 
nori from the rice so in this case
what's<00:04:43.000> what's<00:04:43.900> different<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.440> obviously<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
what's what's different is obviously the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.740 
what's what's different is obviously the
shape<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:45.820> also<00:04:45.940> though<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.270> rice<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:46.690> is

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
shape but also though the rice this is

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.570 
shape but also though the rice this is
the<00:04:46.900> sushi<00:04:47.289> rice<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.310> little<00:04:48.400> bit

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
the sushi rice so it's a little bit

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.250 
the sushi rice so it's a little bit
seasoned<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.150> little<00:04:49.479> bit<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.930> vinegar<00:04:50.229> a

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
seasoned a little bit of vinegar a

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.439 
seasoned a little bit of vinegar a
little<00:04:50.440> bit<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.800> sugar<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.220> salt<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.240> got

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
little bit of sugar and salt so it's got

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.129 
little bit of sugar and salt so it's got
more<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:53.970> more<00:04:54.970> flavor<00:04:55.210> than<00:04:55.389> just<00:04:55.539> the

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
more of a and more flavor than just the

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.330 
more of a and more flavor than just the
regular<00:04:56.289> when<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.710> get<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.949> regular<00:04:57.100> when

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
regular when you get the regular when

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.790 
regular when you get the regular when
you<00:04:57.430> get<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> just<00:04:57.789> has<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> little<00:04:58.120> bit<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.419> salt

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
you get a just has a little bit of salt

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.890 
you get a just has a little bit of salt
so<00:04:59.800> this<00:04:59.950> has<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.160> little<00:05:00.460> bit<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.870> vinegar<00:05:01.870> in

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
so this has a little bit of vinegar in

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.510 
so this has a little bit of vinegar in
it<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.530> delicious<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.430> this<00:05:03.940> one<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.419> tsunami

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
it so delicious and this one is tsunami
