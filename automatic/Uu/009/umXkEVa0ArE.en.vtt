auto button as well that will get you to
the<00:01:40.009> decimal<00:01:40.399> point<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:41.270> running

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
the decimal point so that's now running

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.290 
the decimal point so that's now running
one<00:01:41.660> hundred<00:01:41.959> and<00:01:42.050> twenty<00:01:42.229> two<00:01:42.410> point<00:01:42.979> four

one hundred and twenty two point four
dead-on<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.509> that's<00:01:45.380> pretty<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.069> know<00:01:46.130> quick

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
dead-on and that's pretty you know quick

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.070 
dead-on and that's pretty you know quick
to<00:01:46.729> achieve<00:01:47.030> as<00:01:47.179> well<00:01:47.209> you<00:01:47.420> can<00:01:47.539> tap<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.929> get

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
to achieve as well you can tap to get

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.900 
to achieve as well you can tap to get
yourself<00:01:48.319> in<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.649> ballpark<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.310> then

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
yourself in the right ballpark and then

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.359 
yourself in the right ballpark and then
use<00:01:50.450> those<00:01:50.690> two<00:01:50.869> buttons<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.349> really<00:01:51.770> dial<00:01:52.220> it

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
use those two buttons to really dial it

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.979 
use those two buttons to really dial it
in<00:01:52.489> exactly<00:01:52.940> if<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.149> want<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.420> keep<00:01:53.569> it<00:01:53.750> nicely

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
in exactly if you want to keep it nicely

I dare say other people have come up

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.020 
I dare say other people have come up
with<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.920> as<00:02:48.010> well<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.340> not<00:02:48.519> probably<00:02:48.940> an

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
with it as well it's not probably an

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.400 
with it as well it's not probably an
original<00:02:49.450> thought<00:02:49.629> but<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.080> something<00:02:50.230> I

original thought but it's something I

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.390 
original thought but it's something I
found<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:50.890> own

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
found on my own

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.309 
found on my own
and<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.760> found<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.300> useful<00:02:52.420> these<00:02:52.900> seen

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319

effects on the right hand side are
excellent<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.160> little<00:02:57.280> bit

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
excellent but they can be a little bit

you know this it's a natural track run a
little<00:03:06.519> minimal<00:03:06.880> loop<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.239> often<00:03:07.989> they

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
little minimal loop like this often they

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.640 
little minimal loop like this often they
can<00:03:08.170> really<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:09.280> bit<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.060> your<00:03:10.180> face<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.750> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
can really be a bit in your face and so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.680 
can really be a bit in your face and so
what<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:12.069> is<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.310> ability<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:12.849> cut<00:03:13.540> those

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
what I like is the ability to cut those

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.570 
what I like is the ability to cut those
in<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.989> out<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> good<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.310> behind

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
in and out a good like that that behind

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.880 
in and out a good like that that behind
there<00:03:16.920> again<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.069> kind<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:19.349> does<00:03:20.349> work<00:03:20.620> but

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
there again it kind of does work but

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.039 
there again it kind of does work but
it's<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.370> clicky<00:03:21.910> button<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.329> don't<00:03:22.930> really

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
it's a clicky button you don't really

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.069 
it's a clicky button you don't really
get<00:03:23.560> too<00:03:23.799> much<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.360> too<00:03:25.360> much<00:03:25.450> your<00:03:25.630> control

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
get too much on it too much your control

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.140 
get too much on it too much your control
over<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.590> same<00:03:27.220> thing<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.640> input<00:03:27.970> source

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
over it same thing with the input source

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.690 
over it same thing with the input source
so<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.750> turn<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.739> input<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.310> this

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
so you can turn the input this is this

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.550 
so you can turn the input this is this
top<00:03:31.000> section<00:03:31.360> here<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.569> will<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.319> button

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
top section here that will that button

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.680 
top section here that will that button
there<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.950> input<00:03:33.370> whatever<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.450> coming

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
there is the input whatever is coming

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.390 
there is the input whatever is coming
into<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.079> send<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.220> scene

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
into it you send that to the scene

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.750 
into it you send that to the scene
effect<00:03:36.670> or<00:03:36.849> not<00:03:37.860> okay<00:03:38.860> but<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.340> case<00:03:39.549> well

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
effect or not okay but in this case well

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.280 
effect or not okay but in this case well
my<00:03:39.940> little<00:03:40.180> trick<00:03:40.329> what<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.569> do<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.959> turn

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
my little trick what you do is you turn

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.470 
my little trick what you do is you turn
that<00:03:41.440> off<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.010> input<00:03:42.250> now<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:43.329> main

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that off so this input now the main

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.150 
that off so this input now the main
input<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.870> not<00:03:44.170> going<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.620> scene<00:03:44.829> effects

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
input is not going to the scene effects

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.280 
input is not going to the scene effects
always<00:03:45.489> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.030> scene<00:03:46.209> effect<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:47.049> this

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
always going to the scene effect is this

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.080 
always going to the scene effect is this
section<00:03:47.739> down<00:03:47.859> here<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.609> as<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.850> put<00:03:49.000> this

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
section down here and as you put this

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.000 
section down here and as you put this
into<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.480> role<00:03:49.690> mode<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.560> what<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.799> can<00:03:50.920> do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
into the role mode and what you can do

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.949 
into the role mode and what you can do
you've<00:03:51.160> got<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> long<00:03:51.489> roll<00:03:51.790> say<00:03:52.180> sixteen<00:03:52.690> beats

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
you've got a long roll say sixteen beats

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.809 
you've got a long roll say sixteen beats
eight<00:03:53.260> beats<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:53.920> on<00:03:54.069> here<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:54.940> do

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
eight beats and so on here all you do

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.090 
eight beats and so on here all you do
skew<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:58.230> little<00:03:59.230> tab<00:03:59.440> it's<00:03:59.620> not<00:03:59.739> actually

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
skew a little tab it's not actually

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.140 
skew a little tab it's not actually
going<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.310> roll<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.609> track<00:04:00.819> because<00:04:01.000> you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
going to roll the track because you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.800 
going to roll the track because you
holding<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.810> down<00:04:01.930> for<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.200> shorter<00:04:02.530> length

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
holding it down for a shorter length

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.430 
holding it down for a shorter length
than<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.959> actual<00:04:05.370> rolling

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.140 

just<00:04:10.440> sending

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.490 

and<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.269> can<00:04:17.449> really<00:04:17.540> dollar<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:18.109> with<00:04:18.290> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
and you can really dollar in with the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.930 
and you can really dollar in with the
level<00:04:19.100> as<00:04:19.310> well<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.430> have<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.730> louder

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
level as well so you can have it louder

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.240 
level as well so you can have it louder
or<00:04:23.090> quieter<00:04:23.180> within<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.020> mix<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.949> you<00:04:25.100> can

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
or quieter within the mix and you can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.500 
or quieter within the mix and you can
pictures<00:04:25.639> up<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:28.639> as<00:04:29.030> well<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.360> that's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
pictures up on the as well so that's

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.090 
pictures up on the as well so that's
just<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.900> little<00:04:30.020> thing<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.770> do<00:04:30.889> nice

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.939 
crazy but yeah I think you can get some
really<00:04:44.780> interesting<00:04:45.020> that's<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.560> spiral

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
really interesting that's the spiral

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.659 
really interesting that's the spiral
effect<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.650> because<00:04:51.950> this<00:04:52.100> ex<00:04:52.310> pad<00:04:52.520> is

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
effect and because this ex pad is

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.340 
effect and because this ex pad is
designed<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.360> touched<00:04:53.600> it's<00:04:53.840> designed<00:04:54.200> to

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
designed to be touched it's designed to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.719 
designed to be touched it's designed to
be<00:04:54.470> used<00:04:55.330> fine<00:04:56.330> control<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.490> find

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
be used fine control like that so I find

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.210 
be used fine control like that so I find
that<00:04:58.790> raw<00:04:59.000> works<00:04:59.360> really<00:04:59.960> nicely<00:05:00.470> for<00:05:00.680> me<00:05:00.830> in

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
that raw works really nicely for me in

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.070 
that raw works really nicely for me in
my<00:05:01.340> sets<00:05:01.669> there<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:01.970> go<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:02.270> just<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.540> couple<00:05:02.780> of
