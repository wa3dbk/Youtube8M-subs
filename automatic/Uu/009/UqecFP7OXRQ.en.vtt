exactly<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> strange<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> cable

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
exactly kind of strange how the cable

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
exactly kind of strange how the cable
can<00:01:37.079> run<00:01:37.259> through<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
can run through it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.090 
can run through it
it's<00:01:38.789> pretty<00:01:39.030> weird<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.289> was<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.679> thin

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100

it's pretty weird but it was really thin
passing<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.969> just<00:01:42.149> makes<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.450> wonder<00:01:42.569> how<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
passing it just makes you wonder how the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.490 
passing it just makes you wonder how the
cables<00:01:43.319> going<00:01:43.469> through<00:01:43.859> it<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.640> fact<00:01:44.999> that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
cables going through it in fact that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.980 
cables going through it in fact that
