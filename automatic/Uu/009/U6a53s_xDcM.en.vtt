00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.029
 metal detector teknetics eurotek 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.410
 specially created for European 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.210
 soil balance users here 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.429
 set the average value which 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 best fit 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.650
 European soils the device is designed and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.340
 Launched in 2013 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 despite the lack of some features 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 he is doing his best 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.009
 purpose that is looking for 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 metal objects to the ground well let's 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.130
 let's see how it works 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 switched on with a button 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.760
 located to the right after that we are on 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 We see several indicators on the screen. 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 on the right there will be indicators of the state level 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 battery left 3 sector indicator 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.440
 the depth of the object and in the center 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 was the amount of water and which corresponds 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.570
 found object all metal 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 objects have their own conductivity and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.660
 respectively its number that is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 so the number in principle can be judged on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.720
 volume which object is on the ground 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 here the whole scale let's say discrimination 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.820
 beaten up 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.420
 from 0 to 99 respectively from 0 to 40 it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 iron 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.909
 all above is non-ferrous metal either 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.610
 swim unit has minimum settings and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.400
 rather their hole and allows these 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.490
 installed at the construction site save as 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 this is done when we press 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.479
 we enter the menu button in the settings we see 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 sensitivity set but not 8 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.070
 and you can also change discrimination 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.710
 also set 8 as you can see the volume 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 not regulated here unlike 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.149
 device poke sex euro so about 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.720
 and there is no pinpoint button. 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.829
 how the device works 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.829
 metal keys first brands 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.239
 so if we want to exclude them from 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:24.310
 detection zones we can discriminate 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:28.709
 include more, for example, up to 39 photos 40 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:33.480
 so now the key should not be 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.950
 should be found at all but the coin 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.610
 Catherine's nickle will detect and 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 so is the key 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:56.329
 zero reaction coins 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:57.920
 there is a wedding ring if we want 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.219
 increase instrument sensitivity 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.000
 you need to put it to the maximum 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:06.069
 maximum sensitivity droid 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.629
 Desyatochka so we have a dozen 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.400
 sensitivity and discrimination at 40 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.799
 we want to save these settings so that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.200
 then turn off and turn on the device to 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.030
 they are not to display them again for this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.419
 we press the menu button and hold 8 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.419
 seconds 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.980
 all two indicators show settings 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 saved check off the device 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.799
 turn on go menu 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.840
 a dozen sensitivity 40 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.980
 discrimination what actually and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.250
 it was required to see now how 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 device works 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 the first goal will be just the key since 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.859
 discrimination motorcycle all the iron he does not 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.150
 shows up so let's do 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:16.959
 so that all the same iron and 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:24.010
 found 33-34 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:26.500
 on the iron key in place how changes 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.030
 the depth we raised raised the coil 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.539
 above 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.539
 respectively, the sector as less 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:44.550
 look at catherine penny 99 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.550
 pure signal 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:05:02.410
 we put the key on catherine's penny so 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.970
 what will the device show us like 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.180
 see the number looks a little 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:11.970
 changed did 109 she fell to 84 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.370
 nevertheless it is dripping a color signal 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.890
 84 corresponding metal high straight 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.720
 by conductivity 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:26.440
 accordingly, we will find this coin by this 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:30.300
 the device is not a question, try to replace 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.300
 5 kopek coin of the USSR 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.040
 let's close 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.939
 we can state that this device 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 Of course to distinguish such objects are no longer 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.969
 You can because they are not comparable by 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.969
 the magnitude 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:03.669
 if we respond iron using scream 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:06.129
 and the nation then on this coin miss for 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.919
 in order to find such goals are needed 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:13.270
 more serious devices 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.400
 professional level appliance 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.960
 comes with a good principle 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.909
 instructions in Russian 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.189
 so do not deal with his work 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.889
 make a lot of work in this 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.490
 instructions can answers find answers to 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.159
 questions 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.759
 how to read charge indicator 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.009
 batteries 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.400
 that is, which segment to which voltage 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:38.319
 corresponds and when you need to change 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.789
 battery means how the volume affects 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.789
 speaker on battery charge 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:49.659
 also an overview of all the settings that we 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.969
 Now with you considered how deep it is 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:55.419
 sees major 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:56.979
 coins and the amount of water and for them a shortage 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.169
 so -called 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.860
 describes a 2 tone system which 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:05.889
 used in this device 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.229
 also versed in detail readings 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.689
 depth indicator 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:12.639
 so which sector corresponds to 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:14.770
 what depth how to conduct accurate 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.909
 localization because there is no 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.189
 pinpoint 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:22.960
 describes the overload and the twins 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:25.029
 defecation iron also have a mention of 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.250
 how to use memory and how 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:29.669
 making device that is reset to the reset 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.669
 factory settings 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.310
 note that the device must be powered by 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:40.389
 alkaline alkaline 9 volt type batteries 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.389
 crown 1
