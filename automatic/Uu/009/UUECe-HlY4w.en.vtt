00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.279
 Decorative your liking to me always me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
 she liked to make a red blouse the day 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.750
 of valentine and what better to buy 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 one in a store when you can do 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.879
 one or several in your box for this first 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.820
 style you're going to cut a heart with a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 card are you going to put your heart 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.340
 on top of the light you put glue for 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.739
 clothes this glue is not removed though 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.110
 the bird is the clothes then you are going to put 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.510
 the decorative lath I also wanted 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 make it a symbol of infinity and to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.760
 this is a candle you can use 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.939
 anything they have in your house 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 this was the first thing I bought remember 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.830
 that does not have to be perfect only 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.750
 have fun that when you do it then you will 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.750
 cut to the ribbon with scissors 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.330
 for the second style that are about 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 hearts in the elbows you will need 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.560
 a blouse or a sweater you will need 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.780
 red fabric scissors glue I've seen 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.080
 much this style in stores a 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.330
 blouse was $ 26 I thought it was 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.100
 very expensive, I said I'm going to do it in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.320
 home and I will teach you how to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.080
 external first you are going to put the sweater 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.000
 then you will score with a white hit in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.910
 where do you want hearts to go 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.390
 then you're going to cut your heart you 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.369
 put glue clothes and put them 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.590
 in the place where you've already marked 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.050
 do not worry if it gets wet because 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.840
 then it will dry and you will not notice 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 another option could do it but I feel 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.160
 which is a bit more difficult when 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.470
 you can be easy with glue and you do not go 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.140
 to be at nothing remember what you can do 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 these lights or these sweater with ones that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 already have in your house that you want to give 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.500
 a different style you do not need to go to the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 shop to buy some for the third 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.239
 style let's paint the blouse and for 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.450
 this we need to put a cardboard between 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.569
 in the middle of the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.030
 so that the paint is not transferred then 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.190
 you cut your heart one is painting 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 acrylic on a plate that you no longer use 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.190
 you take your sponge you put little paint 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.920
 I started with the color red and then 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.950
 I mixed red and white to give it a color 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.290
 different than what is the pink then the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.500
 white color I wanted to give it as an effect 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.780
 of gradient but then I wanted to continue 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.360
 putting the and red decorations too 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.250
 that I was going to keep putting roses but 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.260
 I did not feel that there was not so much space 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.680
 for the fourth style you will need 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.470
 a blouse scissors letters cardboard 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.230
 acrylic paint and what I did was 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.930
 I cut my letters I printed them from the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.230
 of the computer with my printer then 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.750
 cut them and then dye them with paint 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.459
 white and if you're wrong a little bit you do not 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.980
 worry because you can use a 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.829
 brochita and that's what I did with my 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.410
 letter l because if I spend a little bit on 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.720
 the white paint and a lot of care when 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.860
 go to remove the paper so it does not 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 go to analyze 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.280
 and that's how this style looks with the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.740
 letters l &amp; v meaning love in English 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.980
 This route has also seen in the store 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.790
 and I thought it would be better to do it at home 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.790
 because it's cheaper 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.370
 it seems last base style to need 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.550
 again a blouse or a pp that you do not use 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.070
 your cardboard scissors you're going to cut what 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.920
 it's a heart and then you're going to give your 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.070
 cardboard that you cut you will put 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.840
 glue inside the cardboard 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.660
 you are only going to use it to do 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.360
 which is the shape of the heart then removes 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.960
 your card and you will set the bar 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.850
 decorative around since you've put 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.370
 all the decorative ribbon around 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.459
 the lok this heart shape are you going to 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.290
 keep putting glue on it and I do not know 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.440
 put a lot of glue so you do not 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.240
 it will stain all only while going 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.260
 putting the book lath putting 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.450
 glue 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.270
 and you're going to do this until it forms 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.850
 everything inside the heart and then 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.680
 you're going to cut it with the scissors I hope 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.660
 that you enjoyed watching this video in 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.690
