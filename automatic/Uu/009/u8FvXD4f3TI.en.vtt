under the house

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
under the house
it's<00:00:21.470> sink<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.130> cross-section

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it's sink you can see the cross-section

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.630 
it's sink you can see the cross-section
where<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.849> cut<00:00:27.119> through<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:28.070> see<00:00:29.070> how<00:00:29.220> much<00:00:29.369> wood

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
where I cut through it see how much wood

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.440 
where I cut through it see how much wood
is<00:00:29.789> gone<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> termites<00:00:31.730> I'm<00:00:32.730> holding<00:00:33.329> up

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
is gone to the termites I'm holding up

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.299 
is gone to the termites I'm holding up
that<00:00:33.690> corner<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> house<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.149> I'm

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that corner of the house and I'm

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.720 
that corner of the house and I'm
replacing<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:40.370> constructing<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
replacing this so I'm constructing it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
replacing this so I'm constructing it
out<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.440> cockeyed

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
out of that's a little bit cockeyed

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
out of that's a little bit cockeyed
there<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.090> odd<00:00:45.300> piece<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> wood

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
there because it's an odd piece of wood

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
there because it's an odd piece of wood
sticking<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:47.120> but<00:00:48.620> it's<00:00:49.620> um<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.309> can't

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
sticking in there but it's um you can't

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
sticking in there but it's um you can't
really<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.230> those<00:00:52.230> goes<00:00:52.949> under<00:00:54.230> back<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
really see it those goes under back that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.220 
really see it those goes under back that
way<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:57.649> fabricated<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> speak

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
way I'm fabricated so to speak

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.939 
way I'm fabricated so to speak
still<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.859> already<00:01:03.350> taking<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
still all I have already taking this to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.780 
still all I have already taking this to
body<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.820> nailed<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> joists<00:01:08.610> in

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
body and nailed it to the joists in

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
body and nailed it to the joists in
there<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.740> I'll<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> fabricate<00:01:12.229> here

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there then I'll have to fabricate here

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
there then I'll have to fabricate here
put<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> piece<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.360> more

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
put a piece here and then put two more

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.490 
put a piece here and then put two more
pieces<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:17.130> big<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.790> twelve

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
pieces here and a big two by twelve

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.020 
pieces here and a big two by twelve
underneath<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> same<00:01:19.890> hand<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.850> below

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
underneath the same hand or two below

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.890 
underneath the same hand or two below
underneath<00:01:21.979> there<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.600> pull

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
underneath there and then I'm gonna pull

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
underneath there and then I'm gonna pull
out<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> rotten<00:01:25.799> piece<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> piece

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
out that rotten piece that was a piece

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
out that rotten piece that was a piece
that<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.439> put<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.829> repair<00:01:30.320> they<00:01:31.320> had

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that they put in for repair they had

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
that they put in for repair they had
replaced<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.189> floor<00:01:32.490> joists<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
replaced the floor joists from the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
replaced the floor joists from the
inside<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:35.280> put<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.360> beams<00:01:37.430> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
inside and they put in these beams to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
inside and they put in these beams to
hold<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> floor<00:01:39.210> joists<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> make

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
hold up the floor joists and to make

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.700 
hold up the floor joists and to make
them<00:01:41.180> strong<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.840> didn't<00:01:43.649> even

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
them strong because they didn't even

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
them strong because they didn't even
nail<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.810> basilica's<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:46.049> knew<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
nail into the basilica's they knew the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.679 
nail into the basilica's they knew the
cell<00:01:46.619> wasn't<00:01:47.100> very<00:01:47.759> strong<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.799> did<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
cell wasn't very strong so they did a

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.609 
cell wasn't very strong so they did a
half<00:01:51.689> way<00:01:53.600> job<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.880> rotten<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:58.020> it's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
half way job and it's rotten see it's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
half way job and it's rotten see it's
rotten<00:01:59.070> under<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.899> wood<00:02:01.110> is
