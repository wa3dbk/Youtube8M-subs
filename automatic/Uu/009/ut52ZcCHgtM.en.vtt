00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 and water this time to do it 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.760
 as if I were 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.670
 when the tire of my car is damaged 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.840
 that is like week to change the rim 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.600
 of account that you are giving to the cat 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.210
 or something because they do not want to call who 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.859
 doctor we make the data 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 there in Ecuador we have given them 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.420
 then I'm fine rising little by little 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 you can do one to another to another and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.630
 they are going up 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.630
 the four that binds that feeling 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.760
 and now I'm going to do that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.760
 as I 'm doing there 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.440
 in that area 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.719
 but it is a phillips 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.549
 with a flat screwdriver 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.780
 if you do not have to despair do not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.870
 I recommend that while a screwdriver 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 here ciliadas because down there are clues 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.920
 the printed circuit you could you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 spoil 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.540
 here we go 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.750
 I repeat again when I had one already 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.560
 the others turns out to be more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 and commonly 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.680
 and we proceed to see I am on Saturday 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.750
 you can realize that it is already a little 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.520
 that you already know 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.520
 and automatically bounce light 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.109
 at this moment here I leave the crosshead not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.560
 it's a problem to say good you should not 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.410
 wrong because they are exactly the same 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.630
 I turn here 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.420
 and now we are going to raise this 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.660
 This is anticipating heat and this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.660
 circuit 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.800
 is the cpu I first start or this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 part because this part allows me 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.610
 lean on the bank 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.730
 to do the work that I just 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.730
 to mention 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.360
 now I will proceed to withdraw 10,000 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.770
 others 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 He turned the tablet over and in the same way 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.090
 my type screwdriver pays the grandchildren between 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.090
 the frog 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.330
 here goes lifting 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.770
 gradually themselves 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.819
 and ready 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.999
 here we could not see it 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.660
 here are the four posts I turn the 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:13.410
 Tablet 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.370
 and now I withdraw that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.370
 heat dissipator 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.750
 now I see the tablet here as well 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.610
 and the identification of circuits that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.600
 this is the cpu and this is the gpu this is 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.480
 the one that overheat 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.120
 and it causes having false problems 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 welding contacts on the part of 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.830
 down 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.700
 this circuit is called pga circuit 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.670
 that talks about a grid is a grid 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.000
 yes that is a fix 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.390
 they were shaped like a grid of kids 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.080
 a grid-shaped arrangement of pins 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.120
 or terminals that have great 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.420
 number of terminals remaining in the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.690
 part of in the bottom part this would be 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.690
 of him 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.239
 gpu and here you see the cpu pins 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.319
 I'm going to zoom in a bit to see if 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.319
 you can see it here 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.500
 there they are integrated circuits of the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.610
 kind of gea that are initials of me 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.479
 talk about an arrangement 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.479
 in a grid 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.140
 Tim is very good here and it was then 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.140
 the motherboard
