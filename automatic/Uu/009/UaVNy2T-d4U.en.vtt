well this is where I'm at so far I've
been<00:00:09.519> building<00:00:10.519> for<00:00:10.580> about<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.850> last<00:00:11.030> hour

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
been building for about the last hour

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.029 
been building for about the last hour
and<00:00:11.960> chain<00:00:12.700> while<00:00:13.700> watching<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.269> movie<00:00:14.300> and

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
and chain while watching a movie and

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.490 
and chain while watching a movie and
I've<00:00:16.039> got<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:19.250> main<00:00:19.460> body<00:00:19.730> pretty<00:00:20.150> much

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
I've got the the main body pretty much

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.140 
I've got the the main body pretty much
well<00:00:21.500> 75<00:00:22.130> percent<00:00:22.580> finished<00:00:22.880> I've<00:00:23.000> got<00:00:23.119> I

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
well 75 percent finished I've got I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.689 
well 75 percent finished I've got I
think<00:00:23.529> there's<00:00:24.529> some<00:00:24.680> fenders<00:00:25.130> here<00:00:25.520> that

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
think there's some fenders here that

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.340 
think there's some fenders here that
need<00:00:25.850> to<00:00:25.940> be<00:00:25.970> added<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:26.840> a<00:00:26.930> few<00:00:27.109> other<00:00:27.260> little

bits and pieces but some the running

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.549 
bits and pieces but some the running
gear<00:00:30.770> is<00:00:30.830> all<00:00:31.160> installed<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:35.350> drivers<00:00:36.350> hatch

gear is all installed the drivers hatch
all<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.220> detail<00:00:37.579> in<00:00:37.760> there<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.120> installed<00:00:41.050> so

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
all the detail in there is installed so

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.380 
all the detail in there is installed so
far<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:44.480> primarily<00:00:45.200> snapped<00:00:46.100> together<00:00:46.390> but

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
far it is primarily snapped together but

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.479 
far it is primarily snapped together but
there<00:00:47.540> are<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.780> few<00:00:47.989> little<00:00:48.980> bits<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:49.430> pieces

there are a few little bits and pieces
that<00:00:49.850> do<00:00:50.149> need<00:00:50.329> to<00:00:50.390> be<00:00:50.570> glued<00:00:50.750> there's<00:00:51.649> some

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
that do need to be glued there's some

that do need to be glued there's some
armoured<00:00:52.219> shutters<00:00:52.610> here<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.090> cover<00:00:53.329> the

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
armoured shutters here that cover the

driver's compartment needs to be glued
there's<00:01:01.850> some<00:01:02.090> little<00:01:02.390> detailed<00:01:02.930> bits<00:01:03.339> here

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
there's some little detailed bits here

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.669 
there's some little detailed bits here
and<00:01:04.399> there<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.369> far<00:01:07.609> it's<00:01:08.209> been<00:01:08.299> about<00:01:08.679> 95%

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
and there but so far it's been about 95%

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.989 
and there but so far it's been about 95%
snap<00:01:10.670> together<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:16.039> tracks<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.670> running

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
snap together the the tracks and running

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.769 
snap together the the tracks and running
gear<00:01:17.240> are<00:01:17.479> designed<00:01:17.959> to<00:01:18.289> move<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.689> it's<00:01:20.689> a

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:20.779 
gear are designed to move but it's a

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.289 
gear are designed to move but it's a
little<00:01:21.200> bit<00:01:21.469> tricky<00:01:21.889> to<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.279> to<00:01:22.520> move

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
little bit tricky to get it to move

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.859 
little bit tricky to get it to move
properly<00:01:23.990> as<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.409> tracks<00:01:25.090> are<00:01:26.090> vinyl<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
properly as the tracks are vinyl and

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.410 
properly as the tracks are vinyl and
they're<00:01:27.109> quite<00:01:27.649> stretchy<00:01:28.219> and<00:01:28.579> they<00:01:28.609> tend<00:01:29.299> to

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
they're quite stretchy and they tend to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.399 
they're quite stretchy and they tend to
to<00:01:30.109> jump<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.529> teeth<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.169> drive

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
to jump the teeth on the on the drive

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.629 
to jump the teeth on the on the drive
wheels<00:01:33.999> quite<00:01:34.999> easily<00:01:36.969> but<00:01:37.969> um<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:40.369> know<00:01:40.399> by

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
wheels quite easily but um you know by

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.870 
wheels quite easily but um you know by
and<00:01:40.789> large<00:01:40.969> it's<00:01:41.240> uh<00:01:41.329> it's<00:01:42.310> it's<00:01:43.310> it's<00:01:43.490> working

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
and large it's uh it's it's it's working

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.609 
and large it's uh it's it's it's working
relatively<00:01:44.779> well<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.289> that<00:01:45.380> looks<00:01:45.529> pretty

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
relatively well and that looks pretty

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.739 
relatively well and that looks pretty
good<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:47.950> I'm<00:01:48.950> quite<00:01:49.399> happy<00:01:49.459> with<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.419> results

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
good so I'm quite happy with the results

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.139 
good so I'm quite happy with the results
I'm<00:01:50.840> getting<00:01:51.079> so<00:01:51.229> far<00:01:51.579> like<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:52.609> said<00:01:52.849> I<00:01:52.880> think

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
I'm getting so far like I said I think

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.589 
I'm getting so far like I said I think
the<00:01:53.270> main<00:01:53.479> body<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.959> about<00:01:54.200> 75%<00:01:54.739> finished<00:01:55.599> and

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
the main body is about 75% finished and

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.239 
the main body is about 75% finished and
then<00:01:56.779> I've<00:01:56.869> got<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.169> move<00:01:57.289> on<00:01:57.499> to<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.859> turret

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
then I've got to move on to the turret

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.729 
then I've got to move on to the turret
I'm<00:01:58.459> going<00:01:58.639> to<00:01:58.700> take<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.359> little<00:02:00.169> break<00:02:00.439> here

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
I'm going to take a little break here

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.849 
I'm going to take a little break here
for<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.009> little<00:02:01.159> while<00:02:01.369> because<00:02:02.739> I've<00:02:03.739> been

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.589 
for a little while because I've been
working<00:02:04.039> for<00:02:04.249> a<00:02:04.399> while<00:02:04.639> and<00:02:06.520> getting<00:02:07.520> tired<00:02:07.819> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
took me about three and a half maybe

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.869 
took me about three and a half maybe
four<00:02:39.120> hours<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.780> building<00:02:40.109> time<00:02:42.109> and

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
four hours with the building time and

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.720 
four hours with the building time and
I'm<00:02:44.879> very<00:02:45.840> much<00:02:46.139> impressed<00:02:46.349> by<00:02:46.769> pretty<00:02:47.670> much

I'm totally impressed with with it on

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.979 
I'm totally impressed with with it on
every<00:03:57.930> level<00:03:59.299> there's<00:04:00.299> really<00:04:00.510> only<00:04:00.629> two

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
every level there's really only two

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.020 
every level there's really only two
seams<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.859> need<00:04:02.129> to<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.340> dealt<00:04:02.579> with<00:04:02.669> and

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
seams that need to be dealt with and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
seams that need to be dealt with and
those<00:04:03.329> are<00:04:04.129> on<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.310> barrels<00:04:05.699> here<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:08.099> would

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
those are on the barrels here it would

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.800 
those are on the barrels here it would
have<00:04:08.340> been<00:04:08.430> nice<00:04:08.609> if<00:04:08.639> there<00:04:09.000> was<00:04:09.180> an<00:04:09.389> option

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
have been nice if there was an option

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.700 
have been nice if there was an option
for<00:04:10.019> for<00:04:10.979> like<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.579> turned<00:04:11.909> mental

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
for for like a turned mental

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.680 
for for like a turned mental
Beryl<00:04:13.710> will<00:04:13.860> set<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.270> probably<00:04:15.480> would

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
Beryl will set but that probably would

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.330 
Beryl will set but that probably would
have<00:04:15.780> driven<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.170> cost<00:04:16.350> up<00:04:16.680> by<00:04:16.830> about<00:04:16.980> another

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
have driven the cost up by about another

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.030 
have driven the cost up by about another
50<00:04:17.700> bucks<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:18.740> considering<00:04:19.740> a<00:04:19.770> higher<00:04:19.920> we

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
50 bucks and considering a higher we

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.930 
50 bucks and considering a higher we
spent<00:04:20.630> two<00:04:21.630> hundred<00:04:21.810> Canadian<00:04:22.170> hotness<00:04:22.940> other

50<00:04:24.330> bucks<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.440> little<00:04:25.710> bit<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.130> than<00:04:26.310> I

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
50 bucks is is a little bit more than I

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.820 
50 bucks is is a little bit more than I
would<00:04:26.520> have<00:04:26.610> been<00:04:26.700> looking<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.970> pay<00:04:27.740> there's<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
would have been looking to pay there's a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.620 
would have been looking to pay there's a
few<00:04:28.980> more<00:04:29.100> photo-etch<00:04:29.640> components<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.600> I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
few more photo-etch components that I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.250 
few more photo-etch components that I
haven't<00:04:30.870> attached<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:33.570> chains<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.170> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
haven't attached some chains for the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.940 
haven't attached some chains for the
ends<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.770> smoke<00:04:35.040> dischargers<00:04:35.690> here<00:04:36.950> some

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
ends on the smoke dischargers here some

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.020 
ends on the smoke dischargers here some
other<00:04:38.130> bits<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.520> pieces<00:04:40.130> mostly<00:04:41.130> mostly<00:04:41.820> odds

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
other bits and pieces mostly mostly odds

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.340 
other bits and pieces mostly mostly odds
and<00:04:42.270> ends<00:04:42.390> that<00:04:42.570> go<00:04:42.720> on<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> figures<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:45.350> I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
and ends that go on the figures and I

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.840 
and ends that go on the figures and I
think<00:04:47.280> there<00:04:47.400> are<00:04:47.460> some<00:04:47.580> sites<00:04:48.890> for<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
think there are some sites for the the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.430 
think there are some sites for the the
machine<00:04:51.000> guns<00:04:51.450> which<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.900> have<00:04:52.050> an<00:04:52.140> attached

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
machine guns which I have an attached

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.990 
machine guns which I have an attached
either<00:04:52.740> because<00:04:53.040> one<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.340> goes<00:04:53.490> there<00:04:53.730> and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
either because one that goes there and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.030 
either because one that goes there and
then<00:04:54.090> one<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.330> goes<00:04:54.480> there<00:04:55.940> I've<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:58.590> haven't

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
then one that goes there I've I haven't

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.730 
then one that goes there I've I haven't
assembled<00:04:59.520> those<00:04:59.850> yet<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.840> they're<00:05:01.530> quite

assembled those yet but they're quite

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.260 
assembled those yet but they're quite
detailed<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.370> then<00:05:02.460> quite<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.030> they<00:05:03.120> look

detailed and then quite and they look

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.220 
detailed and then quite and they look
pretty<00:05:03.420> cool

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
lots of detail overall yeah it took me

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.500 
lots of detail overall yeah it took me
about<00:05:15.960> three<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.220> half<00:05:17.250> hours<00:05:17.880> maybe<00:05:18.210> four

pretty<00:05:39.440> pretty<00:05:40.440> damn<00:05:40.770> big<00:05:41.660> I<00:05:42.770> haven't<00:05:43.770> as<00:05:44.610> I

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
pretty pretty damn big I haven't as I

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.040 
pretty pretty damn big I haven't as I
said<00:05:44.970> before<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.270> haven't<00:05:45.600> done<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.720> lot<00:05:45.810> of

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
said before I haven't done a lot of

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.680 
said before I haven't done a lot of
other<00:05:46.170> armor<00:05:46.620> but<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.340> say<00:05:47.970> compare<00:05:48.360> this<00:05:48.540> to

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
other armor but I say compare this to

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.180 
other armor but I say compare this to
like<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.130> a<00:05:50.130> German<00:05:50.880> World<00:05:51.270> War<00:05:51.510> 2<00:05:51.750> tiger<00:05:52.350> which

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
like a a German World War 2 tiger which

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.250 
like a a German World War 2 tiger which
I've<00:05:53.400> done<00:05:53.730> which<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.240> did<00:05:54.420> several<00:05:54.750> years<00:05:55.050> ago

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
I've done which I did several years ago

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.840 
I've done which I did several years ago
and<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.680> think<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:56.190> was<00:05:56.310> like<00:05:56.370> closer<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.760> about

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
and I think it was like closer to about

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.050 
and I think it was like closer to about
half<00:05:57.060> this<00:05:57.330> size<00:05:58.250> and<00:06:00.980> so<00:06:01.980> yeah<00:06:02.220> I'm<00:06:02.640> quite

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
half this size and so yeah I'm quite

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.520 
half this size and so yeah I'm quite
impressed<00:06:03.180> by<00:06:03.920> by<00:06:04.920> by<00:06:05.280> just<00:06:06.320> everything<00:06:07.320> about

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
impressed by by by just everything about

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.640 
impressed by by by just everything about
this<00:06:07.710> thing

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
this thing

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.390 
this thing
I<00:06:10.350> don't<00:06:11.350> know<00:06:11.410> if<00:06:11.560> I'm<00:06:11.710> going<00:06:11.889> to<00:06:11.949> start<00:06:12.220> doing

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
I don't know if I'm going to start doing

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.560 
I don't know if I'm going to start doing
more<00:06:12.759> armor<00:06:14.490> because<00:06:15.490> I<00:06:15.790> mean<00:06:15.940> since<00:06:16.210> this<00:06:16.360> is

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
more armor because I mean since this is

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.379 
more armor because I mean since this is
still<00:06:16.720> sci-fi<00:06:17.410> it's<00:06:17.680> still<00:06:17.919> Gundam<00:06:18.370> it<00:06:19.090> still

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
still sci-fi it's still Gundam it still

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.740 
still sci-fi it's still Gundam it still
falls<00:06:19.690> under<00:06:20.050> my<00:06:20.080> into<00:06:20.590> my<00:06:20.710> wheelhouse<00:06:20.979> of

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
falls under my into my wheelhouse of

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.249 
falls under my into my wheelhouse of
stuff<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:22.870> like<00:06:23.050> to<00:06:23.110> do<00:06:23.490> but<00:06:24.490> um<00:06:24.880> I've<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.229> far

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
stuff I like to do but um I've so far

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.120 
stuff I like to do but um I've so far
I've<00:06:26.590> had<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.770> lot<00:06:26.919> of<00:06:26.949> fun<00:06:27.160> doing<00:06:27.400> it<00:06:27.610> and<00:06:27.669> and

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
I've had a lot of fun doing it and and

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.379 
I've had a lot of fun doing it and and
because<00:06:30.130> it<00:06:30.250> is<00:06:30.280> snap<00:06:30.610> together<00:06:30.940> it<00:06:31.210> will<00:06:31.330> be

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
because it is snap together it will be

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.279 
because it is snap together it will be
easy<00:06:31.690> to<00:06:31.780> pop<00:06:32.050> apart<00:06:32.320> I<00:06:32.669> mean<00:06:33.669> the<00:06:33.759> turret<00:06:34.060> just

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
easy to pop apart I mean the turret just

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.090 
easy to pop apart I mean the turret just
comes<00:06:35.289> right<00:06:35.380> off<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.919> whole<00:06:36.070> thing

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
comes right off the whole thing

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.260 
comes right off the whole thing
basically<00:06:36.789> comes<00:06:37.000> right<00:06:37.240> apart<00:06:37.330> again<00:06:39.270> so

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
basically comes right apart again so

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.689 
basically comes right apart again so
it'll<00:06:40.509> be<00:06:40.600> really<00:06:40.750> easy<00:06:40.990> to<00:06:41.110> paint<00:06:43.500> so<00:06:44.500> so<00:06:45.490> yeah

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
it'll be really easy to paint so so yeah

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.969 
it'll be really easy to paint so so yeah
I<00:06:46.389> still<00:06:46.900> haven't<00:06:47.169> decided<00:06:47.380> if<00:06:47.620> I'm<00:06:47.770> going<00:06:47.919> to

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979
