00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.650
 well today it has snowed 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.740
 I don't know if you are I don't know where you are from 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 practice both de milks thirsty surely 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.179
 you will have seen it has dedicated so much 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.890
 there were all-white cars 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.499
 and about this I take advantage of it 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.239
 to tell you that oh my god is Christmas 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.369
 richard because why it should be 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.679
 Christmas because he publishes another one tomorrow 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.960

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.699
 my mom what happened what 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.360
 therefore nothing happened 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.400

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.870

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.580
 usually by now public always towards the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.170
 2 because I saw that there are many 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.030
 People say that when tomorrow comes a 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.590
 it's not two because I'm at school first 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.670
 in short, you run away, it's just that later 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.020
 having uploaded a video call that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 we have to talk about here me 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 they all say I'm strange because 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.409
 I read the political toothbrush at hand 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:13.960
 things to be both now tell me when 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:22.450
 you were out of school the two strangers from 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:24.969
 months comes out at 33 I think it depends more 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.679
 than from the region where you are 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.869
 but precisely from the type of school because yes 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.999
 will have some of my friends coming out to 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 noon and 40 I went out at two o'clock 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:37.600
 half someone came out at half past one 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.340
 boys 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.140
 let us know when you leave school 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.210
 unfortunately we say in a condition 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.940
 unlucky because I went out every day 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.770
 at half past two and I went to school too 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.790
 on Saturday and leaving at midday on the 40th 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.170
 so it was so bad the thing 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.850
 that all is over and now we are 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.220
