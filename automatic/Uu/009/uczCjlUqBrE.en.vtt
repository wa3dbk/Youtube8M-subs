you a lot of these kind of funky
connectors<00:02:33.760> LVDS<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:35.450> basically<00:02:35.870> if

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
connectors LVDS that's basically if

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.000 
connectors LVDS that's basically if
you're<00:02:36.050> going<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.230> use<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.740> digital

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you're going to use this in digital

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.580 
you're going to use this in digital
signage<00:02:37.780> applications<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:39.020> any<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:39.560> of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
signage applications or any kind of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.950 
signage applications or any kind of
embedded<00:02:39.980> application<00:02:40.490> which<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.630> actually

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
embedded application which this actually

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.090 
embedded application which this actually
has<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.170> good<00:02:42.470> purpose<00:02:42.620> for<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.010> we'll

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
has a very good purpose for and we'll

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.040 
has a very good purpose for and we'll
get<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.750> minute

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
get to that in just a minute

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.000 
get to that in just a minute
so<00:02:46.040> looking<00:02:46.550> at<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.850> hardware<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.890> have

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so looking at the hardware you you have

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100 
so looking at the hardware you you have
to<00:02:49.160> imagine<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.420> rocket<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
to imagine that this is not a rocket and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.500 
to imagine that this is not a rocket and
trust<00:02:51.740> me<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.190> not<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.610> fact<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.120> pretty

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
trust me it is not in fact it's pretty

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.930 
trust me it is not in fact it's pretty
slow<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:55.010> were<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.220> compare<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.790> an

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
slow if you were to compare it to an

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.640 
slow if you were to compare it to an
Android<00:02:56.390> phone<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:57.020> pocket<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.590> is

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
Android phone in your pocket this is

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.050 
Android phone in your pocket this is
about<00:02:58.480> comparable<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.630> say<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.970> know

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
about comparable to say that's you know

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.560 
about comparable to say that's you know
a<00:03:02.090> galaxy<00:03:02.810> s2<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.860> some<00:03:04.190> ways<00:03:04.400> probably<00:03:05.270> little

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
a galaxy s2 in some ways probably little

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.870 
a galaxy s2 in some ways probably little
slower<00:03:05.810> than<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.110> maybe<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.190> like<00:03:07.610> one

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
slower than that maybe like the like one

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.150 
slower than that maybe like the like one
uh<00:03:07.910> I'm<00:03:08.870> gonna<00:03:08.960> have<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.140> original<00:03:09.530> Droid<00:03:09.860> but

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
uh I'm gonna have the original Droid but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.630 
uh I'm gonna have the original Droid but
the<00:03:10.250> Droid<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:11.920> some<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.100> range<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
the Droid to some of that range so

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.820 
the Droid to some of that range so
suffice<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.630> say<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.870> you're<00:03:14.990> trying<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.530> use

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
suffice to say if you're trying to use

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.570 
suffice to say if you're trying to use
this<00:03:16.130> as<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.940> PC<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.170> PC<00:03:18.560> replacement<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.340> is

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
this as a PC as a PC replacement it is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.650 
this as a PC as a PC replacement it is
not<00:03:19.850> going<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.210> be<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.330> very<00:03:20.540> fun<00:03:20.750> experience

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
not going to be a very fun experience

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.030 
not going to be a very fun experience
main<00:03:23.660> reason<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.140> because<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:24.560> really<00:03:24.800> slow

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
main reason is because it's really slow

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.120 
main reason is because it's really slow
I'm<00:03:25.280> surprised<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.720> being<00:03:27.110> hooked<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> AC

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
I'm surprised that being hooked up to AC

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.530 
I'm surprised that being hooked up to AC
power<00:03:28.760> they<00:03:29.510> put<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.780> such<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.960> low-power

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540

here<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.650> limits<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:39.170> very<00:03:39.920> specific

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
here really limits this to very specific

applications for example really really

a great job of decoding just about

it's<00:03:56.960> just<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:57.290> four<00:03:57.500> handles<00:03:57.920> all<00:03:58.220> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it's just it's four handles all that

now<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> mentioned<00:04:09.980> media<00:04:10.460> playback<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.210> it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
now I mentioned media playback and it

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.730 
now I mentioned media playback and it
comes<00:04:11.690> with<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.870> remote<00:04:12.080> control<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.680> is

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
comes with a remote control and it is

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.760 
comes with a remote control and it is
really<00:04:13.100> really<00:04:13.280> good<00:04:13.700> at<00:04:13.790> playing<00:04:13.940> video<00:04:14.770> but

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
really really good at playing video but

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.400 
really really good at playing video but
this<00:04:15.890> remote<00:04:16.160> kinda<00:04:16.670> bites<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.140> would

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
this remote kinda bites so I would

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.349 
this remote kinda bites so I would
recommend<00:04:18.859> getting<00:04:19.760> some<00:04:19.970> kind<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.180> app<00:04:20.330> you

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
recommend getting some kind of app you

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.880 
recommend getting some kind of app you
can<00:04:20.660> use<00:04:20.840> maybe<00:04:20.989> your<00:04:21.230> smartphone<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:21.859> a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
can use maybe your smartphone as a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.260 
can use maybe your smartphone as a
remote<00:04:22.100> control<00:04:22.160> because<00:04:22.700> this<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.120> doesn't

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
remote control because this just doesn't

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.780 
remote control because this just doesn't
doesn't<00:04:23.870> control<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.380> all<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.650> well<00:04:24.790> now

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
doesn't control it all that well now

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.790 
doesn't control it all that well now
another<00:04:26.030> really<00:04:26.420> good<00:04:26.750> use<00:04:26.930> for<00:04:27.200> this<00:04:27.350> for

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
another really good use for this for

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920 
another really good use for this for
those<00:04:27.980> integrators<00:04:28.700> out<00:04:28.910> there<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.450> in

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
those integrators out there is in

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.190 
those integrators out there is in
digital<00:04:30.140> signage<00:04:31.060> for<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.120> couple<00:04:32.330> reasons<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
digital signage for a couple reasons is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.290 
digital signage for a couple reasons is
extreme<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.040> extremely<00:04:34.490> power<00:04:34.729> efficient

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
extreme it is extremely power efficient

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.000 
extreme it is extremely power efficient
at<00:04:35.570> most<00:04:35.960> when<00:04:36.260> this<00:04:36.410> thing<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.740> chugging

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
at most when this thing is chugging

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.050 
at most when this thing is chugging
along<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.640> high<00:04:37.790> bitrate<00:04:38.030> video<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.660> pulls

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
along on a high bitrate video it pulls

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.450 
along on a high bitrate video it pulls
about<00:04:39.180> 10<00:04:39.450> watts<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.680> less<00:04:40.860> than<00:04:41.070> 1<00:04:41.250> watt

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
about 10 watts and it's less than 1 watt

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.580 
about 10 watts and it's less than 1 watt
and<00:04:41.610> standby<00:04:42.000> which<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.419> incredible<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:43.560> this

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
and standby which is incredible so this

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.820 
and standby which is incredible so this
is<00:04:43.860> not<00:04:44.040> an<00:04:44.160> expensive<00:04:44.490> unit<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.030> run<00:04:45.380> if<00:04:46.380> you

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
is not an expensive unit to run if you

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.710 
is not an expensive unit to run if you
were<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.040> hook<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.490> up<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.820> something<00:04:48.510> with<00:04:48.690> a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
were to hook this up to something with a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.800 
were to hook this up to something with a
touchscreen<00:04:49.110> for<00:04:49.800> example<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:51.210> woods<00:04:51.419> are

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
touchscreen for example this woods are

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.150 
touchscreen for example this woods are
really<00:04:52.290> really<00:04:52.590> well<00:04:52.800> as<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:55.740> know<00:04:55.830> it's<00:04:56.100> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
really really well as you know it's a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.590 
really really well as you know it's a
mini<00:04:56.400> Android<00:04:56.820> it's<00:04:56.970> Android<00:04:57.210> right<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.480> it's

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
mini Android it's Android right so it's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.240 
mini Android it's Android right so it's
gonna<00:04:57.660> operate<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.620> big<00:04:58.800> phone<00:04:58.980> if<00:04:59.190> you

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
gonna operate like a big phone if you

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100 
gonna operate like a big phone if you
put<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> big<00:04:59.700> touchscreen<00:05:00.210> which<00:05:00.960> should

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
put it on a big touchscreen which should

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.860 
put it on a big touchscreen which should
be<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.650> know<00:05:01.710> useful<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.940> kiosks<00:05:03.720> or

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
be you know useful and kiosks or

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.650 
be you know useful and kiosks or
point-of-sale<00:05:04.500> or<00:05:04.740> something<00:05:05.010> like<00:05:05.100> that

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
point-of-sale or something like that

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.090 
point-of-sale or something like that
more<00:05:06.660> importantly<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:07.440> another<00:05:07.680> reason<00:05:07.980> why

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
more importantly and another reason why

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.940 
more importantly and another reason why
it's<00:05:08.280> really<00:05:08.550> good<00:05:08.700> for<00:05:08.880> those<00:05:08.940> applications

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
it's really good for those applications

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.360 
it's really good for those applications
is<00:05:10.950> because<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:11.669> really<00:05:12.240> inexpensive<00:05:13.370> MSRP

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
is because it's really inexpensive MSRP

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.450 
is because it's really inexpensive MSRP
on<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.729> is<00:05:14.910> 129<00:05:15.600> so<00:05:16.560> when<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.950> look<00:05:17.130> at<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.250> lot

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
on this is 129 so when you look at a lot

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.909 
on this is 129 so when you look at a lot
of<00:05:17.490> other<00:05:17.669> small<00:05:18.419> form-factor<00:05:18.840> machines<00:05:19.650> out

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
of other small form-factor machines out

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.490 
of other small form-factor machines out
there<00:05:19.950> like<00:05:20.580> you<00:05:21.300> know<00:05:21.330> Intel's<00:05:21.870> nook<00:05:22.229> for

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
there like you know Intel's nook for

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.200 
there like you know Intel's nook for
example<00:05:22.979> or<00:05:24.229> you<00:05:25.229> know<00:05:25.830> other<00:05:26.070> other<00:05:26.490> even<00:05:27.000> you

example or you know other other even you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.379 
example or you know other other even you
know<00:05:27.300> devices<00:05:27.810> from<00:05:27.990> giada<00:05:28.639> or<00:05:29.639> Lenovo

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
know devices from giada or Lenovo

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.200 
know devices from giada or Lenovo
they're<00:05:30.960> they're<00:05:31.590> Intel<00:05:32.010> Windows<00:05:32.550> PCs<00:05:32.940> so

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
they're they're Intel Windows PCs so

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.969 
they're they're Intel Windows PCs so
they're<00:05:33.360> they're<00:05:33.750> much<00:05:34.050> more<00:05:34.290> powerful

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
they're they're much more powerful

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.120 
they're they're much more powerful
they're<00:05:35.190> gonna<00:05:35.280> do<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.520> lot<00:05:35.850> more<00:05:37.130> processing

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
they're gonna do a lot more processing

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.040 
they're gonna do a lot more processing
and<00:05:38.340> be<00:05:38.460> much<00:05:38.639> more<00:05:39.030> media<00:05:39.180> focused<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:39.900> could

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
and be much more media focused and could

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.950 
and be much more media focused and could
be<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.530> know<00:05:40.560> full<00:05:40.889> pcs<00:05:41.479> or<00:05:42.479> I<00:05:42.510> wouldn't

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
be you know full pcs or I wouldn't

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.570 
be you know full pcs or I wouldn't
recommend<00:05:43.289> this<00:05:43.500> one<00:05:43.680> for<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:43.919> purpose<00:05:44.280> but

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
recommend this one for that purpose but

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.870 
recommend this one for that purpose but
but<00:05:45.539> they're<00:05:45.690> more<00:05:45.840> expensive<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:47.640> there's<00:05:47.789> a

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
but they're more expensive so there's a

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.330 
but they're more expensive so there's a
lot<00:05:48.180> here<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.690> like<00:05:48.870> there's<00:05:49.560> also<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.830> lot<00:05:50.100> here

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
lot here to like there's also a lot here

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.680 
lot here to like there's also a lot here
to<00:05:50.460> dislike<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:52.130> I'm<00:05:53.130> hoping<00:05:53.880> that<00:05:53.940> if<00:05:54.270> we<00:05:54.330> see

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
to dislike so I'm hoping that if we see

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.020 
to dislike so I'm hoping that if we see
another<00:05:54.720> iteration<00:05:55.650> like<00:05:56.310> this<00:05:56.550> from<00:05:56.700> giada

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
another iteration like this from giada

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.060 
another iteration like this from giada
I'd<00:05:57.330> like<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.840> see<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.260> more<00:05:58.500> performance

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
I'd like to see a more performance

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.310 
I'd like to see a more performance
oriented<00:05:59.820> version<00:06:00.240> with<00:06:00.390> a<00:06:00.419> dual<00:06:00.750> or<00:06:01.260> quad
