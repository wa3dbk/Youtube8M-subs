can see they are not the same all the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520 
can see they are not the same all the
beads<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.090> right<00:00:40.300> here<00:00:40.600> are<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:41.230> super

beads to the right here are the super
duo<00:00:41.710> these<00:00:42.340> here<00:00:42.700> are<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.910> twins<00:00:43.510> when<00:00:44.200> I'm

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
duo these here are the twins when I'm

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.390 
duo these here are the twins when I'm
looking<00:00:44.590> at<00:00:44.890> them<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:47.020> on<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.230> mat<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:48.070> twin

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
looking at them here on the mat the twin

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.670 
looking at them here on the mat the twin
beads<00:00:48.579> seem<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.820> lot<00:00:49.000> smaller<00:00:49.630> than<00:00:50.140> these

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
beads seem a lot smaller than these

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.290 
beads seem a lot smaller than these
super<00:00:51.130> duo's<00:00:51.430> even<00:00:51.760> though<00:00:51.850> they<00:00:51.970> say<00:00:52.150> the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
super duo's even though they say the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
super duo's even though they say the
same<00:00:52.540> thing<00:00:52.870> same<00:00:53.320> size<00:00:53.590> that<00:00:54.520> being<00:00:54.820> said<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
same thing same size that being said the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530 
same thing same size that being said the
twin<00:00:57.670> beads<00:00:57.910> here<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:59.640> three<00:01:00.640> colors<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.329> have

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
twin beads here are three colors I have

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.460 
twin beads here are three colors I have
the<00:01:01.720> gray<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.489> matte<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.329> then<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.140> blue

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
the gray and the matte and then the blue

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.310 
the gray and the matte and then the blue
they're<00:01:06.130> also<00:01:06.280> different<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:07.119> size<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:07.630> by

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
they're also different in size just by

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.410 
they're also different in size just by
themselves<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.759> blue<00:01:09.939> one<00:01:10.149> here<00:01:10.299> is

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
themselves so the blue one here is

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.030 
themselves so the blue one here is
actually<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.810> little<00:01:10.960> bit<00:01:11.110> bigger<00:01:11.290> than<00:01:11.829> all

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
actually a little bit bigger than all

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.170 
actually a little bit bigger than all
the<00:01:12.100> others<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:12.610> that's<00:01:12.729> something<00:01:13.060> that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the others so that's something that

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.310 
the others so that's something that
you're<00:01:13.299> going<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.450> notice<00:01:13.750> with<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.049> twins

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
you're going to notice with the twins

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.410 
you're going to notice with the twins
with<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.100> Preciosa<00:01:16.500> brand<00:01:17.940> they<00:01:18.940> don't<00:01:19.180> also

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
with the Preciosa brand they don't also

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.920 
with the Preciosa brand they don't also
come<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:19.900> as<00:01:20.049> many<00:01:20.260> colors<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.030> twin<00:01:22.540> C

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
come in as many colors with the twin C

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.899 
come in as many colors with the twin C
with<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.320> super<00:01:23.620> duos<00:01:23.890> here<00:01:24.220> you're<00:01:24.760> going<00:01:24.850> to

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
with the super duos here you're going to

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.450 
with the super duos here you're going to
get<00:01:25.030> more<00:01:25.270> colors<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.020> more<00:01:26.470> finishes<00:01:27.220> on

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
get more colors and more finishes on

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.450 
get more colors and more finishes on
them<00:01:27.700> they<00:01:28.690> are<00:01:28.930> more<00:01:29.260> consistent<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:30.130> size

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
them they are more consistent in size

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580 
them they are more consistent in size
but<00:01:31.270> I'm<00:01:31.390> noticing<00:01:31.720> when<00:01:32.110> we're<00:01:32.229> picking<00:01:32.500> up

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
but I'm noticing when we're picking up

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.140 
but I'm noticing when we're picking up
the<00:01:32.650> neon<00:01:33.040> ones<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.580> they<00:01:33.670> almost<00:01:33.820> have<00:01:34.090> like

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
the neon ones that they almost have like

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.050 
the neon ones that they almost have like
a<00:01:34.270> cross<00:01:35.190> look<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.369> them<00:01:36.520> when<00:01:36.820> they're<00:01:36.909> going

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
a cross look to them when they're going

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940 
a cross look to them when they're going
to<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.390> two<00:01:37.630> holes<00:01:37.869> so<00:01:38.080> they<00:01:38.560> have<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:38.830> you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
to the two holes so they have if you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.590 
to the two holes so they have if you
turn<00:01:39.130> them<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.460> side<00:01:39.700> they<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> little

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
turn them on the side they have a little

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240 
turn them on the side they have a little
point<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.439> middle<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.770> almost<00:01:41.979> looks<00:01:42.159> like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
point in the middle it almost looks like

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.609 
point in the middle it almost looks like
an<00:01:42.430> owl's<00:01:42.610> face<00:01:43.060> whereas<00:01:44.020> most<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.530> other

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
an owl's face whereas most of the other

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.130 
an owl's face whereas most of the other
ones<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:45.280> aren't<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.939> neons<00:01:46.240> are<00:01:46.479> more

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
ones that aren't the neons are more

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.310 
ones that aren't the neons are more
definitely<00:01:47.979> kind<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:48.880> rice<00:01:49.180> shaped<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:50.170> they

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
definitely kind of rice shaped that they

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.230 
definitely kind of rice shaped that they
don't<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.950> point<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.820> middle<00:01:52.119> when

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
don't have that point in the middle when

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880 
don't have that point in the middle when
you're<00:01:52.390> looking<00:01:52.659> at<00:01:52.810> them<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:53.409> both<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> twins

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
you're looking at them so both the twins

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.800 
you're looking at them so both the twins
and<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.280> super<00:01:54.520> duos<00:01:54.820> have<00:01:55.060> two<00:01:55.270> holes<00:01:55.540> they

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
and the super duos have two holes they

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.300 
and the super duos have two holes they
have<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> total<00:01:56.229> hole<00:01:56.439> at<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.590> top<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.220> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
have a total hole at the top and at the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.700 
have a total hole at the top and at the
bottom<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.049> other<00:01:59.200> differences

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
bottom the one of the other differences

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.510 
bottom the one of the other differences
is<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:01.270> twin<00:02:01.900> beads<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.560> all<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
is that the twin beads here all the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.929 
is that the twin beads here all the
twins<00:02:03.820> are<00:02:04.090> based<00:02:04.360> on<00:02:04.630> black<00:02:05.320> or<00:02:05.939> crystal

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
twins are based on black or crystal

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.660 
twins are based on black or crystal
colored<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.110> glass<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.129> what<00:02:09.280> they<00:02:09.399> do<00:02:09.459> is

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
colored of glass then what they do is

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.369 
colored of glass then what they do is
they<00:02:09.819> put<00:02:10.030> coatings<00:02:10.450> over<00:02:10.780> them<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.110> make<00:02:11.140> them

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
they put coatings over them to make them

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.679 
they put coatings over them to make them
the<00:02:11.500> light<00:02:11.709> blue<00:02:11.980> or<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.459> gray<00:02:12.760> or<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.360> matte

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
the light blue or the gray or that matte

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:18.570 
the light blue or the gray or that matte
finish<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.670> super<00:02:16.209> duo<00:02:16.390> beads<00:02:17.550> they<00:02:18.550> are

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
finish with the super duo beads they are

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.150 
finish with the super duo beads they are
actually<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> color<00:02:19.450> glass<00:02:19.780> -<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.739> metallic

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
actually the color glass - the metallic

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
actually the color glass - the metallic
one<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.550> I'll<00:02:21.610> take<00:02:21.819> care

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
one so I'll take care

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.449 
one so I'll take care
-<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.620> neon<00:02:23.620> ones<00:02:23.829> I'll<00:02:23.950> take<00:02:24.099> those<00:02:24.219> off

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
- the neon ones I'll take those off

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.449 
- the neon ones I'll take those off
these<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.019> color<00:02:26.230> glass<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
these are actually the color glass that

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.890 
these are actually the color glass that
you<00:02:27.609> see<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:28.060> they<00:02:28.209> are<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.629> when<00:02:28.780> you're

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you see that they are so when you're

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.690 
you see that they are so when you're
looking<00:02:29.170> at<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.560> tail<00:02:30.099> bead<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.609> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
looking at the tail bead and the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.610 
looking at the tail bead and the
turquoise<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.569> are<00:02:31.719> actually<00:02:32.140> turquoise

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
turquoise they are actually turquoise

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.319 
turquoise they are actually turquoise
glass<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.219> one<00:02:33.370> here<00:02:33.549> is<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:34.030> white

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
glass this one here is actually white

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.000 
glass this one here is actually white
glass<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.989> color<00:02:35.200> goes<00:02:35.469> the<00:02:35.650> whole<00:02:35.829> way

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
glass the color goes the whole way

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.039 
glass the color goes the whole way
through<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.609> did<00:02:36.939> a<00:02:37.060> little<00:02:37.180> experiment<00:02:38.019> here

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
through I did a little experiment here

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.800 
through I did a little experiment here
and<00:02:38.439> I<00:02:38.500> crushed<00:02:38.560> up<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.219> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.810> Preciosa

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
and I crushed up one of the Preciosa

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.199 
and I crushed up one of the Preciosa
twin<00:02:41.650> beads<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.129> then<00:02:42.219> I<00:02:42.310> crushed<00:02:42.639> up<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.879> super

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
twin beads and then I crushed up a super

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.209 
twin beads and then I crushed up a super
duo<00:02:43.389> bead<00:02:43.719> the<00:02:44.260> twin<00:02:44.530> bead<00:02:44.709> definitely<00:02:45.099> is

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
duo bead the twin bead definitely is

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.979 
duo bead the twin bead definitely is
crystal<00:02:45.670> inside<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.569> has<00:02:46.840> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
crystal inside and then just has the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:47.819 
crystal inside and then just has the
gray<00:02:47.200> coating

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
gray coating

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.330 
gray coating
whereas<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.760> super<00:02:49.030> duo<00:02:49.239> here<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:51.010> red

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
whereas the super duo here is the red

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.849 
whereas the super duo here is the red
the<00:02:51.609> whole<00:02:51.639> way<00:02:51.969> through<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:53.230> being<00:02:53.500> said

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
the whole way through that being said

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.199 
the whole way through that being said
when<00:02:54.069> they<00:02:54.189> have<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.730> coatings<00:02:55.060> on

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
when they have the little coatings on

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.059 
when they have the little coatings on
the<00:02:55.299> side<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:55.780> superjoe<00:02:56.169> there<00:02:56.919> is<00:02:57.040> a

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
the side for the superjoe there is a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.920 
the side for the superjoe there is a
possibility<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.760> coating<00:02:58.540> will<00:02:58.659> come<00:02:58.810> off

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
possibility that coating will come off

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.330 
possibility that coating will come off
because<00:02:59.260> it's<00:02:59.470> not<00:02:59.739> going<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.129> whole<00:03:00.159> way

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
because it's not going the whole way

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.619 
because it's not going the whole way
through<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:00.939> has<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.329> Picasso

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
through so if it has like a Picasso

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.890 
through so if it has like a Picasso
coating<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.769> half<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.220> B<00:03:03.430> coating<00:03:03.909> or<00:03:04.180> matte

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
coating or half a B coating or matte

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.690 
coating or half a B coating or matte
coating<00:03:05.139> here<00:03:05.319> on<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> side<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.950> can

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
coating here on the side that can

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.970 
coating here on the side that can
possibly<00:03:07.030> come<00:03:07.659> off<00:03:07.870> whereas<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> twin<00:03:08.799> bead

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
possibly come off whereas the twin bead

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.119 
possibly come off whereas the twin bead
again<00:03:09.129> is<00:03:09.549> going<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.139> possibly<00:03:11.139> come<00:03:11.709> off<00:03:11.859> the

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
again is going to possibly come off the

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.890 
again is going to possibly come off the
whole<00:03:12.370> thing<00:03:12.760> because<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.180> whole<00:03:13.299> thing<00:03:13.629> is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
whole thing because the whole thing is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.170 
whole thing because the whole thing is
coated<00:03:14.349> and<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.219> a<00:03:15.370> fraction<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
coated and not just a fraction of it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.959 
coated and not just a fraction of it
another<00:03:16.930> thing<00:03:17.139> when<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.409> look<00:03:17.439> at<00:03:17.919> them<00:03:18.129> I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:18.969 
another thing when you look at them I

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.909 
another thing when you look at them I
already<00:03:19.299> talked<00:03:19.629> about<00:03:19.719> the<00:03:20.019> size<00:03:20.349> difference

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
already talked about the size difference

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.039 
already talked about the size difference
when<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> look<00:03:21.669> at<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.879> twin<00:03:22.120> beads<00:03:22.599> they<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:23.019> a

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
when I look at the twin beads they are a

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.890 
when I look at the twin beads they are a
little<00:03:23.319> bit<00:03:23.500> smaller<00:03:23.950> than<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.909> super<00:03:25.540> duos

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
little bit smaller than the super duos

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.619 
little bit smaller than the super duos
they<00:03:26.530> do<00:03:26.590> come<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.489> twin<00:03:27.760> beads<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.239> less

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
they do come the twin beads in less

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.680 
they do come the twin beads in less
color<00:03:28.930> variety<00:03:29.470> than<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.949> super<00:03:30.310> duos<00:03:30.699> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
color variety than the super duos the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.089 
color variety than the super duos the
super<00:03:31.959> duo<00:03:32.109> is<00:03:32.319> they<00:03:32.440> tend<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> have<00:03:32.889> at<00:03:33.069> least

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
super duo is they tend to have at least

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.119 
super duo is they tend to have at least
four<00:03:33.489> finishes<00:03:33.940> or<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.449> per<00:03:34.780> color<00:03:35.129> and

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
four finishes or so per color and

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.110 
four finishes or so per color and
they're<00:03:36.250> coming<00:03:36.519> out<00:03:36.609> with<00:03:36.639> different<00:03:37.030> ones

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
they're coming out with different ones

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.399 
they're coming out with different ones
both<00:03:37.389> brands<00:03:37.900> are<00:03:38.079> coming<00:03:38.290> out<00:03:38.379> with

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
both brands are coming out with

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.869 
both brands are coming out with
different<00:03:38.799> colors<00:03:39.099> constantly<00:03:39.699> and<00:03:39.790> we're

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
different colors constantly and we're

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.240 
different colors constantly and we're
kind<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.090> getting<00:03:40.389> them<00:03:40.569> in<00:03:40.810> when<00:03:41.709> I'm<00:03:41.859> working

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
kind of getting them in when I'm working

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.349 
kind of getting them in when I'm working
with<00:03:42.280> them<00:03:42.549> one<00:03:42.760> thing<00:03:42.909> that<00:03:43.060> I've<00:03:43.150> noticed

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
with them one thing that I've noticed

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.969 
with them one thing that I've noticed
with<00:03:43.629> both<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.989> them<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.260> because<00:03:44.439> some<00:03:44.949> of

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
with both of them is because some of

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.369 
with both of them is because some of
them<00:03:45.220> are<00:03:45.430> coated<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.209> some<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.930> them<00:03:47.049> have

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
them are coated and some of them have

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.219 
them are coated and some of them have
the<00:03:47.650> extra<00:03:48.040> finishes<00:03:48.609> on<00:03:48.819> them<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:49.930> both

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
the extra finishes on them for both

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.460 
the extra finishes on them for both
styles<00:03:51.009> sometimes<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.090> second<00:03:52.540> hole

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
styles sometimes the second hole

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.050 
styles sometimes the second hole
one<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:53.979> holes<00:03:54.159> can<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:54.430> blocked<00:03:54.819> if

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
one of the holes can be blocked if

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.520 
one of the holes can be blocked if
that's<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.720> case<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.049> want<00:03:56.199> to<00:03:56.229> take<00:03:56.349> your

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that's the case you want to take your

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.710 
that's the case you want to take your
needle<00:03:56.859> through<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.609> side<00:03:57.970> that's<00:03:58.209> going

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
needle through the side that's going

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.509 
needle through the side that's going
through<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.229> then<00:03:59.590> kind<00:03:59.889> of<00:03:59.979> twisting<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.430> all

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
through and then kind of twisting it all

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.309 
through and then kind of twisting it all
around<00:04:00.639> sometimes<00:04:01.599> it<00:04:01.750> works<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.139> if<00:04:02.229> you

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
around sometimes it works that if you

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.259 
around sometimes it works that if you
have<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.500> block<00:04:02.739> tool<00:04:02.949> you<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.310> get<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.669> hole

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
have a block tool you can get that hole

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.719 
have a block tool you can get that hole
opened<00:04:04.810> up<00:04:04.919> sometimes<00:04:05.919> it<00:04:06.099> will<00:04:06.250> not<00:04:06.489> work<00:04:06.669> so

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
opened up sometimes it will not work so

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.280 
opened up sometimes it will not work so
if<00:04:07.090> you're<00:04:07.239> stringing<00:04:07.629> a<00:04:07.810> bunch<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.169> you're

if you're stringing a bunch and you're
getting<00:04:08.439> putting<00:04:09.009> them<00:04:09.129> on<00:04:09.250> your<00:04:09.400> project<00:04:09.790> if

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
getting putting them on your project if

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.179 
getting putting them on your project if
you<00:04:10.299> see<00:04:10.509> a<00:04:10.540> block<00:04:11.019> tool<00:04:11.229> try<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> recognize

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
you see a block tool try to recognize

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.879 
you see a block tool try to recognize
that<00:04:12.430> right<00:04:12.759> away<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.479> will<00:04:13.930> say<00:04:14.229> I<00:04:14.259> have<00:04:14.379> found

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
crazy neons which apparently are really

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.090 
crazy neons which apparently are really
bright<00:05:08.840> underneath<00:05:09.320> white<00:05:09.560> light<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.039> if

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
bright underneath white light so if

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.320 
bright underneath white light so if
you're<00:05:10.220> going<00:05:10.460> clubbing<00:05:10.760> there<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.240> good

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
you're going clubbing there and good

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.020 
you're going clubbing there and good
colored<00:05:11.720> pick<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.199> pick<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:13.310> then<00:05:13.789> you<00:05:13.910> can

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
colored pick to pick and then you can

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.469 
colored pick to pick and then you can
also<00:05:14.210> lay<00:05:14.660> them<00:05:14.930> flat<00:05:15.320> out<00:05:16.250> make<00:05:17.030> different

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
also lay them flat out make different

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.240 
also lay them flat out make different
bands<00:05:17.900> with<00:05:18.050> them<00:05:18.320> as<00:05:18.590> you're<00:05:18.770> working<00:05:19.100> with

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
bands with them as you're working with

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.640 
bands with them as you're working with
them<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.900> one<00:05:20.900> thing<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:21.320> have<00:05:21.500> noticed

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650

them and one thing that I have noticed
with<00:05:22.010> both<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.729> do<00:05:22.970> not<00:05:23.120> want<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.389> pull<00:05:23.570> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
with both is you do not want to pull the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.170 
with both is you do not want to pull the
strings<00:05:23.990> too<00:05:24.350> tight<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:24.949> have<00:05:25.729> fun<00:05:26.000> with

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
strings too tight so have fun with

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.930 
strings too tight so have fun with
whatever<00:05:26.360> you're<00:05:26.690> working<00:05:27.110> with<00:05:27.940> deciding

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
whatever you're working with deciding

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.420 
whatever you're working with deciding
which<00:05:29.300> one<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.720> use<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:30.139> kind<00:05:30.289> of<00:05:30.410> your<00:05:30.860> your

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
call most patterns will work with both
