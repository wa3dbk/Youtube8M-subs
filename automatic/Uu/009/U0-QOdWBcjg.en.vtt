 half the road was in power 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.019
 rain but then completely dry asphalt 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.730
 it made minor adjustments to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800

 Workout that took place on the newest 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.380
 circuit in Sochi 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.970
 the track is very fast 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.710
 should be very careful about 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.540
 especially now itâ€™s raining 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 other pilots took to the track for more

 new yes there is also rain 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.100
 increased the risk there were concerns because

 nature told us there would be showers and 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.860
 showers were and drainage coped perfectly 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.070

 asphalt adhesion coefficient 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.450
 a little lower on it is not a pool for which 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.979
 the car will be with the opinion of the pilots 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.050
 other experts agreed 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.210
 difficult weather conditions for Sochi 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.740
 the slopes are not a hindrance even when it rains 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.780
 intensified the main judge decided not to 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.820
 stop training runs 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.340
 despite the same training run 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.560
 still going on by international 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.940
 weather conditions competition is not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.250
 interference and now we can observe 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.380

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 pilots so for the organizers 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.850
 competition on the highway 16 turns that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.009

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 rises three times in a matter of 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.440
 seconds 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.950
 other tracks have no such speed 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.960
 turns Zeus and the most Well, how would 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.980
 dangerous it is possible to break the car in 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.710
 high-speed corners if frustrated by the day 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 there are two such places here therefore 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.910
