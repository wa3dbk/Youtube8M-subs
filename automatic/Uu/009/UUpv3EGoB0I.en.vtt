line<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.390> actual<00:02:12.750> pants<00:02:13.020> themselves<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
line the actual pants themselves with a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
line the actual pants themselves with a
nylon<00:02:14.459> mesh<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.209> allows<00:02:15.450> plenty<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.110> air<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
nylon mesh that allows plenty of air to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380 
nylon mesh that allows plenty of air to
flow<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:16.800> through<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.190> there<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.209> he

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
flow right through it there is see he

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.479 
flow right through it there is see he
approves<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:19.080> armor<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.590> these<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.040> its

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
approves me armor in these and its

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.920 
approves me armor in these and its
height<00:02:20.700> adjustable<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.510> there's<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> knee

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
height adjustable so there's the knee

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.990 
height adjustable so there's the knee
armor<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.410> you'll<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.459> might<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.790> hard<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
armor and you'll see it might be hard to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.880 
armor and you'll see it might be hard to
show<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.420> camera<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:25.349> are<00:02:25.500> three

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
show you on camera but there are three

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.980 
show you on camera but there are three
velcro<00:02:26.370> strips

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
velcro strips

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.920 
velcro strips
at<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.410> top<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.070> bottom<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.480> pocket

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
at the top and the bottom of the pocket

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.330 
at the top and the bottom of the pocket
for<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.170> knee<00:02:30.350> armor<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.770> right<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:30.980> it's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
for the knee armor so right now it's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220 
for the knee armor so right now it's
actually<00:02:31.670> down<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.210> lowest<00:02:32.600> position<00:02:32.780> I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
actually down on the lowest position I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.960 
actually down on the lowest position I
could<00:02:33.800> release<00:02:34.100> some<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.490> velcro<00:02:34.670> at<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
could release some of the velcro at the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970 
could release some of the velcro at the
top<00:02:35.180> slide<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.110> there's<00:02:36.560> two<00:02:36.830> more

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
top slide it up and there's two more

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.370 
top slide it up and there's two more
positions<00:02:37.490> above<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.940> which<00:02:38.450> allows<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.050> to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
positions above that which allows you to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.550 
positions above that which allows you to
sit<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.010> armor<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.520> your<00:02:41.060> knees<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.560> optimum

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
sit the armor on your knees for optimum

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.540 
sit the armor on your knees for optimum
position<00:02:42.950> while<00:02:43.400> you're<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.850> bike<00:02:45.550> in

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
position while you're on your bike in

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.430 
position while you're on your bike in
addition<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.390> knee<00:02:47.660> armor<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.200> have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
addition to the knee armor you have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.860 
addition to the knee armor you have
ballistic<00:02:49.070> style<00:02:49.400> nylon<00:02:49.910> over<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> knees<00:02:50.600> so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
ballistic style nylon over the knees so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.630 
ballistic style nylon over the knees so
that's<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.140> really<00:02:51.170> abrasion<00:02:51.890> resistant<00:02:52.400> tough

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that's a really abrasion resistant tough

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.120 
that's a really abrasion resistant tough
material<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.720> area<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.200> then<00:02:54.770> on<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
material in that area and then on the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.340 
material in that area and then on the
back<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.520> pants<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.540> seat<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.170> have

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
back of the pants in the seat you have

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.500 
back of the pants in the seat you have
the<00:02:57.500> same<00:02:57.740> style<00:02:58.070> material<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.090> really

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the same style material so it's really

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.270 
the same style material so it's really
abrasion<00:03:00.020> resistant<00:03:00.440> where<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.680> counts<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
abrasion resistant where it counts you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.460 
abrasion resistant where it counts you
have<00:03:01.430> foam<00:03:01.700> pit<00:03:01.940> pads<00:03:02.210> in<00:03:02.420> these<00:03:02.570> as<00:03:02.750> well<00:03:02.780> so

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
have foam pit pads in these as well so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.290 
have foam pit pads in these as well so
if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.680> do<00:03:03.800> go<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.490> you're<00:03:04.880> sliding<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
if you do go down and you're sliding a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.060 
if you do go down and you're sliding a
little<00:03:05.540> bit<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:06.440> are<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.770> hold<00:03:06.950> up

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
little bit these are going to hold up

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.820 
little bit these are going to hold up
really<00:03:07.370> well<00:03:07.610> where<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.000> matters<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.620> may

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
really well where it matters you may

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.350 
really well where it matters you may
have<00:03:09.860> also<00:03:10.130> noticed<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.760> there<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.000> ton<00:03:11.330> of

have also noticed that there is a ton of

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.360 
have also noticed that there is a ton of
reflective<00:03:11.930> material<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.530> these<00:03:12.650> large
