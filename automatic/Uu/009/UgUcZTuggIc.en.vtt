together<00:01:07.070> very<00:01:07.430> well<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.910> did<00:01:08.360> have<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.600> little

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
together very well I did have a little

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.010 
together very well I did have a little
bit<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:10.030> wrestle<00:01:11.030> getting<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:13.660> left<00:01:14.660> leg<00:01:14.930> I

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
bit of a wrestle getting the left leg I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.010 
bit of a wrestle getting the left leg I
think<00:01:15.050> it<00:01:15.410> was<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.310> fit<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.180> pin<00:01:17.420> didn't<00:01:17.840> seem

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
think it was to fit the pin didn't seem

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.990 
think it was to fit the pin didn't seem
to<00:01:18.259> quite<00:01:18.740> line<00:01:19.009> up<00:01:19.040> properly<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.820> was<00:01:19.970> a

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to quite line up properly so it was a

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400 
to quite line up properly so it was a
little<00:01:20.240> bit<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.509> a<00:01:20.540> struggle<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.200> getting

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
little bit of a struggle just getting

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that to squeeze in there but it did fit

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.660 
that to squeeze in there but it did fit
and<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:24.170> body<00:01:24.350> fits<00:01:24.649> together<00:01:24.830> very<00:01:25.190> well<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
and the body fits together very well the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.760 
and the body fits together very well the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
seam lines on the body look like I might

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.080 
seam lines on the body look like I might
get<00:01:27.890> away<00:01:28.100> without<00:01:28.340> having<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.819> use<00:01:28.940> any

see some shiny in the middle where the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.730 
see some shiny in the middle where the
joint<00:01:40.819> is<00:01:40.940> where<00:01:41.569> there's<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.050> little<00:01:42.350> bit<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.619> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
joint is where there's a little bit of a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.730 
joint is where there's a little bit of a
dip<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.759> there's<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.390> couple<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.110> tiny<00:01:45.380> sink

just<00:01:49.850> down<00:01:50.090> here<00:01:50.450> there<00:01:50.780> will<00:01:50.959> need<00:01:51.140> fill<00:01:51.410> in

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
just down here there will need fill in

without<00:02:05.750> filler<00:02:06.110> some<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.709> them<00:02:06.830> are<00:02:06.950> all

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
without filler some of them are all

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.830 
without filler some of them are all
definitely<00:02:07.429> need<00:02:07.729> bits<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.179> feel<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.569> here

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
definitely need bits of feel like here

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.980 
definitely need bits of feel like here
now<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.160> combination<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.209> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
now this this is a combination of the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.390 
now this this is a combination of the
problem<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.500> was<00:02:12.590> talking<00:02:12.980> about<00:02:13.010> with<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
problem I was talking about with the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
problem I was talking about with the
fairly<00:02:13.670> brittle<00:02:13.970> plastic<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.660> cutting<00:02:15.530> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
fairly brittle plastic and cutting a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 
fairly brittle plastic and cutting a
little<00:02:15.680> divot<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.310> when<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.610> were<00:02:16.730> actually

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
little divot in when you were actually

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.890 
little divot in when you were actually
cutting<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.230> tag<00:02:18.440> off<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.400> sprue

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
cutting the the tag off of the sprue

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.020 
cutting the the tag off of the sprue
it's<00:02:20.900> easy<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.500> hard<00:02:21.830> plastic<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's easy to do on hard plastic and this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's easy to do on hard plastic and this
is<00:02:23.180> what's<00:02:23.360> happened<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.550> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
is what's happened here and and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.220 
is what's happened here and and
further<00:02:26.590> down<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.400> case<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:28.170> there's<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
further down is just a case of there's a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.559 
further down is just a case of there's a
bit<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.129> dip<00:02:30.340> where<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.700> two<00:02:30.849> pieces<00:02:31.150> join

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
bit of a dip where the two pieces join

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.470 
bit of a dip where the two pieces join
so<00:02:32.140> rather<00:02:32.349> than<00:02:32.650> Sun<00:02:33.129> that<00:02:33.340> down<00:02:33.519> too<00:02:33.819> far<00:02:34.150> and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
so rather than Sun that down too far and

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.319 
so rather than Sun that down too far and
ruin<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> profile<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:36.159> little<00:02:36.700> dab<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.000> filler

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329

and<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:38.079> then<00:02:38.200> Sunday<00:02:38.500> down<00:02:38.739> from<00:02:38.980> there

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and then and then Sunday down from there

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.660 
and then and then Sunday down from there
and<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.549> will<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.879> trick<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.340> say

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
and that will do the trick so as I say

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.740 
and that will do the trick so as I say
it's<00:02:42.909> it's<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.690> very<00:02:43.720> easy<00:02:44.310> assembly<00:02:45.750> fits

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
it's it's a very easy assembly fits

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.390 
it's it's a very easy assembly fits
together<00:02:46.930> very<00:02:47.260> well<00:02:47.349> indeed<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.250> give

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
together very well indeed it's just give

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000 
together very well indeed it's just give
you<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.519> little<00:02:48.970> bit<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.450> closeup<00:02:49.900> what's<00:02:50.560> most

something personally I don't think
that's<00:03:28.030> bad<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.359> always<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:29.170> mean<00:03:29.889> it's<00:03:30.340> not

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
that's bad it's always I mean it's not

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.119 
that's bad it's always I mean it's not
particularly<00:03:30.940> dramatic<00:03:31.620> pose<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:32.980> not

particularly dramatic pose it's not

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.119 
particularly dramatic pose it's not
particularly<00:03:33.699> exciting<00:03:34.599> but<00:03:35.349> it's<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
particularly exciting but it's the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.589 
particularly exciting but it's the
detail<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.669> model<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:39.599> so

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
detail of the model that I like so so

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.720 
detail of the model that I like so so
it's<00:03:40.930> got<00:03:41.079> one<00:03:41.230> foot<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> back<00:03:41.859> here<00:03:42.250> one

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
it's got one foot on the back here one

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.369 
it's got one foot on the back here one
foots<00:03:42.970> on<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.150> front<00:03:43.449> I<00:03:43.599> think<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.930> these<00:03:44.109> pegs

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
foots on the front I think on these pegs

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.140 
foots on the front I think on these pegs
which<00:03:44.590> have<00:03:44.739> been<00:03:44.889> retained<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.819> facing

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
which have been retained it's facing

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.589 
which have been retained it's facing
that<00:03:46.540> way<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.889> got<00:03:48.099> its<00:03:48.400> hand<00:03:48.699> up<00:03:48.879> in<00:03:49.209> a

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
that way and it's got its hand up in a

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.050 
that way and it's got its hand up in a
repulsive<00:03:50.079> last<00:03:50.349> motion<00:03:50.919> so<00:03:51.669> it's<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.849> little

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
repulsive last motion so it's a little

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.900 
repulsive last motion so it's a little
bit<00:03:52.209> more<00:03:52.569> dramatic<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.410> there's<00:03:54.310> also

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
bit more dramatic and there's also

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.119 
bit more dramatic and there's also

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
having a look haven't had a look around

simple<00:04:16.090> build<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.659> depending<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.380> how<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
simple build and depending on how the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.469 
simple build and depending on how the
paint<00:04:17.859> goes<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.220> might<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.760> might<00:04:19.239> actually

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
paint goes it might I might actually

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.080 
paint goes it might I might actually
look<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.380> one<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.310> one<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.880> ways

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
look it and one of the one of the ways

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.570 
look it and one of the one of the ways
to<00:04:22.270> mark<00:04:22.479> suits<00:04:22.810> but<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.860> have<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.159> say<00:04:24.310> looking

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
to mark suits but I have to say looking

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.159 
to mark suits but I have to say looking
at<00:04:24.699> comparisons<00:04:25.330> between<00:04:25.479> them<00:04:25.840> because<00:04:26.080> I've

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
at comparisons between them because I've

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.570 
at comparisons between them because I've
been<00:04:26.289> looking<00:04:26.560> at<00:04:26.650> comparisons<00:04:27.159> between<00:04:27.280> the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
been looking at comparisons between the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.580 
been looking at comparisons between the
suits<00:04:27.789> and<00:04:28.090> what-have-you<00:04:29.050> again

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
suits and what-have-you again

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.260 
suits and what-have-you again
for<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> colors<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.810> such<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.940> think

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
for for the colors and such that I think

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.530 
for for the colors and such that I think
I<00:04:34.390> prefer<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.830> far<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.460> mark<00:04:36.700> three<00:04:37.030> suit<00:04:37.300> I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
I prefer so far the mark three suit I

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.270 
I prefer so far the mark three suit I
think<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.810> look<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.290> especially<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
think the look of it especially the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520 
think the look of it especially the
lower<00:04:39.760> leg<00:04:40.060> pieces<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.750> look<00:04:40.900> much<00:04:41.200> more

seen a mark five suit which is
unfortunate<00:05:42.730> because<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:43.060> thought<00:05:43.510> that

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
unfortunate because I thought that

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.290 
unfortunate because I thought that
looked<00:05:43.960> quite<00:05:44.140> nifty<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:45.090> let's<00:05:46.090> face<00:05:46.240> it

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
looked quite nifty and let's face it

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.520 
looked quite nifty and let's face it
we're<00:05:46.570> all<00:05:46.690> like<00:05:46.900> one<00:05:47.110> run<00:05:47.440> away<00:05:47.650> so<00:05:49.350> there<00:05:50.350> we

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
we're all like one run away so there we

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.880 
we're all like one run away so there we
are

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
are

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.580 
are

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
and and position it on the base so that

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.210 
and and position it on the base so that
I<00:06:03.790> can<00:06:03.940> apply<00:06:04.030> some<00:06:04.540> thin<00:06:05.080> glue<00:06:05.380> down<00:06:06.040> the

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
I can apply some thin glue down the

seams of the legs and get those two set
in<00:06:09.010> place<00:06:09.250> because<00:06:09.670> I<00:06:10.030> don't<00:06:10.270> want<00:06:10.540> them

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750

locating<00:06:18.820> on<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.150> base<00:06:19.330> but<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.960> way<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.140> see

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
locating on the base but the way I see

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.830 
locating on the base but the way I see
it<00:06:20.470> is<00:06:20.770> once<00:06:21.430> it's<00:06:21.640> on<00:06:21.790> the<00:06:21.940> base<00:06:22.090> I<00:06:22.540> should<00:06:22.720> be

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
it is once it's on the base I should be

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.660 
it is once it's on the base I should be
able<00:06:22.900> to<00:06:23.020> do<00:06:23.290> that<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:23.680> still<00:06:23.860> lift<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:24.310> up<00:06:24.460> and

able to do that and still lift it up and
off<00:06:24.760> the<00:06:24.790> base<00:06:25.230> should<00:06:26.230> I<00:06:26.290> wish<00:06:26.530> to<00:06:26.680> do<00:06:26.800> so

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
off the base should I wish to do so

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.440 
off the base should I wish to do so
which<00:06:27.190> I'll<00:06:27.340> need<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.610> do<00:06:27.700> for<00:06:27.880> painting<00:06:28.300> and

has mentioned the height of the figure

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.020 
has mentioned the height of the figure
alone<00:06:49.730> is<00:06:53.650> about<00:06:54.650> is<00:06:55.160> just<00:06:55.400> shy<00:06:55.700> of<00:06:55.730> two

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
alone is about is just shy of two

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.850 
alone is about is just shy of two
hundred<00:06:56.240> and<00:06:56.480> thirty<00:06:56.750> five<00:06:57.020> millimeters<00:06:57.740> and

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
hundred and thirty five millimeters and

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.830 
hundred and thirty five millimeters and
that's<00:06:58.040> just<00:06:58.310> shy<00:06:58.550> of<00:06:58.580> nine<00:06:59.000> and<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.300> quarter

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
that's just shy of nine and a quarter

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.230 
that's just shy of nine and a quarter
inches<00:07:00.320> in<00:07:00.560> total<00:07:01.100> so<00:07:01.400> it's<00:07:01.550> just<00:07:01.700> over<00:07:01.910> nine

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
inches in total so it's just over nine

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.530 
inches in total so it's just over nine
inches<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:03.320> total<00:07:04.280> height<00:07:04.520> including<00:07:05.420> the

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
inches the total height including the

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.020 
inches the total height including the
stand<00:07:05.990> is<00:07:07.180> 270<00:07:08.180> millimeters<00:07:09.340> which<00:07:10.340> equates

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
stand is 270 millimeters which equates

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.490 
stand is 270 millimeters which equates
to<00:07:11.680> just<00:07:12.680> over<00:07:13.520> 10<00:07:14.000> and<00:07:14.330> a<00:07:14.450> half<00:07:14.660> inches<00:07:15.200> so

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
to just over 10 and a half inches so

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.160 
to just over 10 and a half inches so
it's<00:07:16.190> a<00:07:16.280> good<00:07:16.400> size<00:07:16.670> there<00:07:17.510> you<00:07:17.630> go<00:07:17.780> the<00:07:17.930> Paint

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
it's a good size there you go the Paint

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.430 
it's a good size there you go the Paint
Pot<00:07:18.380> which<00:07:18.500> comes<00:07:18.770> to<00:07:18.830> about<00:07:19.310> the<00:07:19.490> ankle<00:07:19.880> and

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 
Pot which comes to about the ankle and

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.280 
Pot which comes to about the ankle and
that<00:07:21.520> would<00:07:22.520> be<00:07:22.640> about<00:07:22.900> 3/4<00:07:23.900> of<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.050> way<00:07:24.140> up

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
that would be about 3/4 of the way up

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.060 
that would be about 3/4 of the way up
the<00:07:24.380> shin<00:07:24.620> from<00:07:25.010> the<00:07:25.220> base<00:07:25.400> of<00:07:25.610> the<00:07:25.700> foot<00:07:25.910> so

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
the shin from the base of the foot so

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.910 
the shin from the base of the foot so
you<00:07:28.070> can<00:07:28.220> see<00:07:28.340> it's<00:07:28.460> quite<00:07:28.640> a<00:07:28.670> large<00:07:28.880> figure<00:07:29.920> so

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
you can see it's quite a large figure so

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.830 
you can see it's quite a large figure so
there's<00:07:31.100> the<00:07:31.220> figure<00:07:31.400> built<00:07:31.700> sitting<00:07:32.570> on<00:07:32.690> its

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
there's the figure built sitting on its

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.190 
there's the figure built sitting on its
base<00:07:33.050> once<00:07:33.980> the<00:07:34.160> glue<00:07:34.310> is<00:07:34.340> set<00:07:34.610> on<00:07:34.820> there<00:07:35.200> I've

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 
base once the glue is set on there I've

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.990 
base once the glue is set on there I've
already<00:07:36.560> gone<00:07:36.710> around<00:07:37.010> there<00:07:37.250> with<00:07:37.460> with<00:07:37.970> a

mould lines where the pieces join need
to<00:07:45.710> be<00:07:45.830> hidden<00:07:46.040> so<00:07:47.470> some<00:07:48.470> of<00:07:48.500> them<00:07:48.740> will

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040 
to be hidden so some of them will

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.160 
to be hidden so some of them will
require<00:07:49.070> filler<00:07:49.700> some<00:07:49.970> won't<00:07:50.240> once<00:07:50.930> that's

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.170 
require filler some won't once that's

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.800 
require filler some won't once that's
fully<00:07:51.350> dry<00:07:51.710> I<00:07:52.040> will<00:07:52.220> be<00:07:52.400> attacking<00:07:53.300> the<00:07:53.510> areas

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:53.810 
fully dry I will be attacking the areas

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.930 
fully dry I will be attacking the areas
requiring<00:07:54.140> a<00:07:54.290> bit<00:07:54.410> of<00:07:54.560> filler<00:07:54.800> and<00:07:55.100> then<00:07:55.730> a<00:07:55.760> bit

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:55.940 
requiring a bit of filler and then a bit

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.400 
requiring a bit of filler and then a bit
more<00:07:56.090> sunning<00:07:56.480> down<00:07:56.660> and<00:07:56.930> then<00:07:57.050> it's<00:07:57.230> going<00:07:57.350> to

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:57.410 
more sunning down and then it's going to

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.230 
more sunning down and then it's going to
be<00:07:57.530> followed<00:07:57.830> by<00:07:57.950> a<00:07:57.980> quick<00:07:58.520> wipe<00:07:58.670> over<00:07:59.000> and<00:07:59.180> a

00:07:59.230 --> 00:07:59.240 
be followed by a quick wipe over and a

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.250 
be followed by a quick wipe over and a
primer<00:07:59.510> coat<00:08:00.850> and<00:08:01.850> after<00:08:02.810> that<00:08:02.930> it'll<00:08:03.200> be

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:03.260 
primer coat and after that it'll be

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.200 
primer coat and after that it'll be
another<00:08:03.860> check<00:08:04.190> to<00:08:04.370> see<00:08:04.550> if<00:08:04.670> I've<00:08:04.790> missed<00:08:04.970> any

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.210 
another check to see if I've missed any

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.330 
another check to see if I've missed any
areas<00:08:05.570> that<00:08:05.600> require<00:08:05.870> additional<00:08:06.260> filling<00:08:06.860> if

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.340 
areas that require additional filling if

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.100 
areas that require additional filling if
so<00:08:07.580> that<00:08:07.790> will<00:08:07.910> get<00:08:08.360> the<00:08:08.450> additional<00:08:08.810> filling

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.110 
so that will get the additional filling

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.310 
so that will get the additional filling
and<00:08:09.740> another<00:08:09.950> coat<00:08:10.160> of<00:08:10.340> primer<00:08:10.610> and<00:08:11.320> then

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:12.320 
and another coat of primer and then

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.570 
and another coat of primer and then
we'll<00:08:12.470> be<00:08:12.620> ready<00:08:12.800> for<00:08:12.860> the<00:08:13.040> base<00:08:13.190> coat<00:08:13.400> of

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:13.580 
we'll be ready for the base coat of

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.790 
we'll be ready for the base coat of
