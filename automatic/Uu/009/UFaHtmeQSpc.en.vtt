 projects that seek to combat

 violence in schools but that the work 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.909
 it's the medium to long term 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 still according to the secretariat the

 of adolescents also very affected 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.479
 for parents what guidance is what

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.869
 for this psychopedagogue the increase of

 cases of violence among adolescents 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.480
 surprising as much as the speed in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 that they are posted on the internet 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.860
 according to the specialist in education 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.840
 moment of this youth violence is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.159
 related to several factors 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 It is during adolescence that they are 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.450
 self-affirming they are forming your 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.150
 then they divide into groups until they 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.910
 to feel individuals and within that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.120
 context they begin to even rivalry 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.940
 and this rivalry is creating this for 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 this problem of violence because a 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.290
 want to appear more than the other wants 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.750
 show power and neither in this aspect

 violence is getting more and more 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.769

 share a type of behavior 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.609
 be in social networks videos fotos is a 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.980
 way to encourage error 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.069
 they think this is a trophy which 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.200
 could be done is that people do not 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.950
 to repudiate education specialist

 says that the family mainly 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.390
 parents and the school can and should 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 encourage behavior change 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.920
 of these young people 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.709
 parents have to propose if the students 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 to excuse the children to the adolescents 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.480
 a peaceful environment at home which 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 consequently he is taking this 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.980
 for all the places he goes
