00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.719
 have fun the SG Seehausen style 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.079
 that's right 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.369
 there 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.249
 there 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.050
 Because of this combination guide we have small caves as an aid 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.210
 and to take the small steps forward and then at the right moment 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.930
 push away 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.930
 and also react to the shallow-shot ball 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.740
 very well 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 Have a game ball 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.900
 co2ol of the wanted important are the small steps forward that would 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.010
 Throw me all the way and then just get to the point where I am 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.980
 can really get away 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.330
 since I can also vary it with an intermediate step between the hurdles 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.460
 and every single life 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 You can vary that as well as the bowl i can be flat up as well 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.869
 Sun placer has all possible variations on this one 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.070
 exercise 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 and the last one 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 and built and barely controllable 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 I will not be able to change 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.450
 the belt it goes before all these exercises with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 the small hurdle that the feet and knees are not too high 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.689
 that I can not push away right away that might be fast 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.979
 Contact with the ground has to be able to jump high into the corner 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 under the 16th 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.270
 the belt 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.449
 pity anyway makes good long 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.119
 Of course, WC as coach has to be careful that even the last one 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.780
 Hurdle is still taken reasonable 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.380
 and the goalie is perfect. Both are a big advantage 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.019
 provides 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.769
 then offer 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.170
 Therefore, if possible in the forest then throw 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 when he's over the last hurdle, and has contact, or should he 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.170
 stay away in the moment can push so far in this exercise everything in it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.999
 So speed race it is before the Nations Cup exclusivity Rincon 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.659
 all the answer to that is represented in this exercise 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.469
 Not 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.219
 Vienna 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 w 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.339
 I 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.659
