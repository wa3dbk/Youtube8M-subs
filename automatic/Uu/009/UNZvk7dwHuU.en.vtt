typing some random text here you can see

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
typing some random text here you can see
it<00:00:42.809> defaults<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> inside<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.010> margins<00:00:44.520> we

it defaults the inside of our margins we

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
it defaults the inside of our margins we
can<00:00:45.270> change<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.719> default<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:47.100> I'm

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
little gap on the left so we're going to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.980 
little gap on the left so we're going to
close<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.490> we're<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.450> over

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
close it and we're going to back it over

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.330 
close it and we're going to back it over

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the side of the page a little bit on the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
the side of the page a little bit on the
left<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:52.150> come<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> print<00:02:52.930> preview<00:02:53.020> and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
left and come back to print preview and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.950 
left and come back to print preview and
now<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.850> completely<00:02:55.300> lines<00:02:55.540> up<00:02:55.720> with<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
now it completely lines up with the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.750 
now it completely lines up with the
edges<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.290> our<00:02:56.380> document<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.670> were

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
edges of our document so if you were

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.830 
edges of our document so if you were
printing<00:02:58.120> something<00:02:58.390> with<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> background

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
printing something with a background

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.440 
printing something with a background
this<00:02:59.440> would<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.920> way<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.070> get<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.640> right<00:03:01.270> to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
this would be the way to get it right to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.610 
this would be the way to get it right to
the<00:03:01.540> edges<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.990> page<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.320> don't<00:03:02.380> have

the edges of the page you don't have

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.200 
the edges of the page you don't have
that<00:03:02.740> annoying<00:03:03.100> white<00:03:03.460> strip<00:03:03.760> you'd<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.060> to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
that annoying white strip you'd have to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.850 
that annoying white strip you'd have to
cut<00:03:04.420> off

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
cut off

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.920 
cut off
sidenote<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.090> may<00:03:07.210> lose<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> little<00:03:07.720> bit<00:03:07.840> of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
sidenote you may lose a little bit of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.690 
sidenote you may lose a little bit of
your<00:03:08.080> graphic<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> edges<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:08.980> that's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
your graphic on the edges but that's

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.230 
your graphic on the edges but that's
alright

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
alright
