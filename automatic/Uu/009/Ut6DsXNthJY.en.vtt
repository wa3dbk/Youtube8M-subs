be<00:02:54.090> taking<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:55.200> those<00:02:55.380> headaches<00:02:55.590> really

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
be taking because those headaches really

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.949

were uncomfortable and hard to deal with

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.330 
were uncomfortable and hard to deal with
when<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.170> first<00:02:58.350> started<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.770> training<00:02:59.160> but

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
when you first started your training but

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.300 
when you first started your training but

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
like I said they go away so can't

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.350 
like I said they go away so can't
complain<00:03:02.400> too<00:03:02.790> much
