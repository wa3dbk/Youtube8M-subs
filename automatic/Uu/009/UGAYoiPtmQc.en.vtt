00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
they do that every single week so they

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.360 
they do that every single week so they
need<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.609> be<00:03:12.879> looked<00:03:13.090> after<00:03:13.560> there's<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.680> breed

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
really are an egg pump they will produce

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.220 
really are an egg pump they will produce
up<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.900> 350<00:03:20.889> eggs<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.459> year<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.750> that's<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.049> lot<00:03:23.200> of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
up to 350 eggs a year so that's a lot of

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.319 
up to 350 eggs a year so that's a lot of
eggs<00:03:23.549> alternatively<00:03:24.549> if<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.790> go<00:03:25.000> for<00:03:25.209> other

breeds<00:03:25.750> fancier<00:03:26.590> breeze<00:03:26.829> then<00:03:27.099> you<00:03:27.220> might<00:03:27.430> get

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
breeds fancier breeze then you might get

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.339 
breeds fancier breeze then you might get
down<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:28.000> about<00:03:28.090> 240<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.169> 260<00:03:30.099> eggs<00:03:30.370> per<00:03:31.060> year

down to about 240 to 260 eggs per year
egg<00:03:32.349> production<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.160> most<00:03:33.609> in<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.060> spring<00:03:34.450> and

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
egg production is most in the spring and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.940 
egg production is most in the spring and
the<00:03:34.660> summer<00:03:34.900> when<00:03:35.200> there's<00:03:35.410> more<00:03:35.590> Sun<00:03:35.919> more

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
the summer when there's more Sun more

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.400 
the summer when there's more Sun more
daylight<00:03:36.489> hours<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.629> winter<00:03:37.959> it

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
daylight hours and in the winter it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.430 
daylight hours and in the winter it
really<00:03:38.859> starts<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> ramp<00:03:39.760> down<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.989> although

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
really starts to ramp down so although

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.740 
really starts to ramp down so although
we<00:03:41.560> may<00:03:41.709> love<00:03:41.919> our<00:03:42.069> chickens<00:03:42.519> they<00:03:42.879> do<00:03:42.940> end<00:03:43.389> up

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
we may love our chickens they do end up

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.659 
we may love our chickens they do end up
getting<00:03:44.109> quite<00:03:44.470> smelly<00:03:44.889> especially<00:03:45.489> their

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.119 
getting quite smelly especially their
enclosure<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.780> can<00:03:47.139> reduce<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.919> smell

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
enclosure now you can reduce the smell

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.970 
enclosure now you can reduce the smell
by<00:03:48.519> cleaning<00:03:48.879> them<00:03:49.120> out<00:03:49.209> regularly<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.620> even

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
by cleaning them out regularly but even

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.170 
by cleaning them out regularly but even
then<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.190> might<00:03:51.459> want<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.790> think<00:03:52.060> about

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
then you might want to think about
