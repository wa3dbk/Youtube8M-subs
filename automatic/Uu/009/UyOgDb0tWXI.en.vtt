00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just use his Cybertronian mold since

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
just use his Cybertronian mold since
they<00:00:37.140> were<00:00:37.980> formed<00:00:38.399> since<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.760> showed<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
they were formed since they showed it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970

helicopter there's no gimmick to rotate
the<00:00:54.690> blades<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> spin<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the blades you just have to spin a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.470 
the blades you just have to spin a
manually<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.670> spin<00:00:57.530> fairly<00:00:58.530> well

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
manually but they do spin fairly well

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
manually but they do spin fairly well
you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> back<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.350> tail<00:01:01.590> rotor

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you can see the back here is tail rotor

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
you can see the back here is tail rotor
which<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> gonna<00:01:02.820> become<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> disc<00:01:03.420> launcher<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
which is gonna become a disc launcher in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.719 
which is gonna become a disc launcher in
robot<00:01:04.199> mode

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
robot mode

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
robot mode
just<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> quick<00:01:05.970> size<00:01:06.210> comparison<00:01:06.560> I'm<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.799> he

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just a quick size comparison I'm here he

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.170 
just a quick size comparison I'm here he
is<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.330> Voyager<00:01:09.330> Starscream

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
is with Voyager Starscream

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.609 
is with Voyager Starscream
they<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.420> sing<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.900> idea<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.439> how

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
they just sing get an idea of about how

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
big he is in helicopter mode now he does

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
big he is in helicopter mode now he does
sadly<00:01:16.950> suffer<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> lug

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
sadly suffer a little bit from the lug

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
sadly suffer a little bit from the lug
nut<00:01:18.390> syndrome<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:20.009> due<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.369> he

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
nut syndrome and that just due to how he

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
nut syndrome and that just due to how he
transforms<00:01:21.119> he<00:01:21.270> ends<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.600> while<00:01:22.350> he's<00:01:22.500> very

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
transforms he ends up while he's very

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
transforms he ends up while he's very
much<00:01:23.189> Voyager<00:01:23.640> sized<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.060> vehicle<00:01:24.420> mode<00:01:24.450> he

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
much Voyager sized in vehicle mode he

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
much Voyager sized in vehicle mode he
ends<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.890> small<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> robot<00:01:27.390> mode

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
ends up a little small in robot mode

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.249 
ends up a little small in robot mode
because<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
because of it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.940 
because of it
a<00:01:28.579> small<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.729> bulky<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.100 

they<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.310> helicopter<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
they have my helicopter the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.750 
they have my helicopter the
transformation<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> fairly<00:01:37.440> simple<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.010> want

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
transformation is fairly simple you want

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.240 
transformation is fairly simple you want
to<00:01:38.820> pull<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:41.299> off<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> tail<00:01:42.630> rotor<00:01:42.810> here

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
to pull off the off the tail rotor here

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.469 
to pull off the off the tail rotor here
that<00:01:44.250> wants<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> come<00:01:44.670> off<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.119> go

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that wants to come off there we go

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
that wants to come off there we go
so<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:45.750> snap<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> off<00:01:46.970> set<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> off<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so I snap that off set that off to the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
so I snap that off set that off to the
side<00:01:48.649> we're<00:01:49.649> gonna<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:51.000> legs<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.970> one

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
side we're gonna take the legs this one

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.710 
side we're gonna take the legs this one
down<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.450> split<00:01:54.780> them<00:01:54.840> apart<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:59.720> this

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
down just split them apart like this

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.779 
down just split them apart like this
just<00:02:01.560> split<00:02:01.830> apart<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:04.550> bring<00:02:05.550> them<00:02:05.640> down

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
just split apart here bring them down

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.330 
a quick size idea there he is with
Starscream<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:04.260> he<00:04:04.379> ends<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.620> short<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.160> bulky

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
Starscream so he ends up short but bulky

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.100 
Starscream so he ends up short but bulky
a<00:04:05.670> lot<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.150> love<00:04:06.360> net<00:04:06.540> he's<00:04:06.660> about<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> same

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
a lot like love net he's about the same

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.869 
a lot like love net he's about the same
height<00:04:07.349> as<00:04:07.379> love<00:04:07.709> net<00:04:07.890> actually<00:04:08.190> lug<00:04:08.670> nuts

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
height as love net actually lug nuts

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.910 
height as love net actually lug nuts
head<00:04:09.120> comes<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.629> about<00:04:09.750> right<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.470> with

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
head comes to about right here but with

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.410 
head comes to about right here but with
the<00:04:11.040> overall<00:04:11.370> propeller<00:04:11.849> he's<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.150> little<00:04:12.330> bit

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
the overall propeller he's a little bit

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.189 
the overall propeller he's a little bit
taller<00:04:12.599> than<00:04:12.720> lug<00:04:12.959> nut<00:04:14.840> just<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.959> give<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.139> an

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
pretty good distance and it shoots even

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.040 
pretty good distance and it shoots even
farther<00:04:44.220> depending<00:04:44.669> on<00:04:44.760> how<00:04:44.910> hard<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:46.020> can
