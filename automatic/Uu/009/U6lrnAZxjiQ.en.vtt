00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay before you continue working on the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.880 
okay before you continue working on the
rest<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.300> problems<00:00:03.659> independently<00:00:04.140> I

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
rest of the problems independently I

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.249 
rest of the problems independently I
would<00:00:05.370> like<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:05.970> sure<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.779> kind<00:00:07.080> of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
are on the right track with number three

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.990 
are on the right track with number three
so<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.200> ask<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.830> little<00:00:11.219> shifting<00:00:11.849> to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
so I'm going to ask a little shifting to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.490 
so I'm going to ask a little shifting to
go<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> classroom<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> pair

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
go on in the classroom I'm going to pair

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.220 
go on in the classroom I'm going to pair
you<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.679> differently<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.670> see<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:16.020> can

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you up differently and see if you can

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
you up differently and see if you can
come<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.580> strategy<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.300> solve<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
come up with a strategy to solve the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.269 
come up with a strategy to solve the
problem<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.230> maybe<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.560> already<00:00:19.770> did<00:00:19.980> come<00:00:20.160> up

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
problem or maybe you already did come up

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.160 
problem or maybe you already did come up
with<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> same<00:00:20.640> strategy<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> can

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
perspective of how to solve the problem

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.410 
perspective of how to solve the problem
and<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.439> course<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.180> higher

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and of course if one was a little higher

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
and of course if one was a little higher
level<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> other<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:47.009> explain<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
level than the other they can explain it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270 
level than the other they can explain it
to<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:47.909> almost<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> peer<00:01:48.780> tutor<00:01:49.220> may<00:01:50.220> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
