00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.740
 Dimitri Daeseleire we are still here after 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.700
 to talk to Cynthia after the game 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 the design 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.299
 yes image with your hario cup design against 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.090
 your lord actually 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.850
 syntra de we win how are you 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.949
 for a difficult situation of course 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.289
 but no the is was really its all 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.880
 January wins will also have 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.289
 there is a difficult trace here and then 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 then you come to feel the string 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.789
 farmers so no the victory is that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.170
 tastes really good 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.360
 of course for some people here one 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.820
 supporter in the players' finger joint 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.620
 paraded in finals ticket now and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.329
 first I do money for me 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.289
 personally in what meets you today 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.969
 have 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.680
 that is not a nice night out 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.059
 quickly forget this 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.949
 you can imagine what that would be 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.359
 in terms of supporters if you really would 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.550
 get involved for the prizes and trip 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.579
 yes you will not get away with less 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.530
 Basically it is a take out handbag bag bag 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.050
 fantastic come to 0 2 who i think 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.309
 certainly not unmerited 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.750
 organizational how it played and then 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.160
 on we may counter a breeze 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 can make throat come twice 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.270
 how slightly in this cars one time 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.250
 fantastic right but how we do things 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.860
 things played in as a trainer it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.300
 wheel very short on everyone and if you 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.040
 growth mindset is, and you know we 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.510
 address and then it is actually more to it 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.270
 get this group then well we are now standing 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.920
 We need insurance to top 5 quickly what us 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.600
 especially noticeable in recent weeks he has 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.930
 somewhere that your defenses since hips 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.880
 also westlo now saint we give give 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.170
 very little away though looks very short 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.550
 Baker 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.990
 gosh yeah it's the russians we don't have 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.520
 enough point there though I think if you then 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 nevertheless achieves such a good distribution then must 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.820
 you get more points 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.790
 so a dime in itself 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.320
 but from today on in indeed 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.700
 your machine we defended very strongly though 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.440
 be able to participate in a week and then 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.280
 it was not on roeselare and tubeke 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.720
 so 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.310
 so then we take two and three 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.750
 goals so this needs to weekly 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.790
 it's all it's been improved I guess 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.930
 hear the month of January but it is 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.860
 well not constant enough besides us then 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.650
 can still 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.420
 yes but already done for your season 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.670
 but then they are actually much more 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.310
 found out of this design is week 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.380
 another important match in terms of honor 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.630
 I Ostend and if the most with 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 results day next week champion 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.130
 Playing on the owl also be a 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.890
 competition in itself 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.780
 god can you west come to our champion 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.100
 play so is really your central today 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 I drank from it is where we got the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.780
 three your three top wages in a row we now 4 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.880
 6 to beautiful they had to 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 Can be 5 to 9 or force to 9 and 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.180
 cheek do everything to tune it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 as difficult as possible and what 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
 you gained in the title fight I think 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.390
 for the other teams but it's good 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.340
 too bad you actually have none at all 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.260
 no more opting-in points distribution 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.700
 to belong to stone had a note 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.990
 do for their time 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.459
 for a title the name was something whole 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.280
 otherwise that an angry just one week 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 just packed with genoa now you're sharp 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.580
 Richter in it is actually just 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.050
 just need for our own how you 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.540
 people don't continue that line t that 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.030
 top plowing and then our own watching and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.600
 maybe pick dots ok 3 in a lot 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 good luck 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.720
 good
