00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 Raindrops come closer to the sound of waves 

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:32.300
 On the beach we should be playing together 

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:40.400
 Surely someone is broken in love and disturbs the seed of the rumor 

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:48.700
 Your body will get wet soon 

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:56.900
 When the chest shakes, a drop dances in the sand 

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:05.500
 Summer without giving up words 

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.000

 Shameful girlfriend and Pacific Hotel 

00:01:52.501 --> 00:02:00.400
 I will look at my back on the back of the glass 

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:09.200
 I can not see the swimsuit that cuts down to the waist 

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:17.300
 Drink hot tea with a thin shower meaning 

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:25.500
 My lover is crying Summer of giving up 

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:33.500
 Darlin 'Can't You See? I'll Try To Make It Shine 

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:43.200
 Darlin 'Be With Me! Let's Get To Be So Fine 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.900
 If you can see the shadow in the rocky shadow, a rainbow will appear 

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:13.400
 Enoshima is sleeping far in the distance 

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:25.000
 It is this summer with you
