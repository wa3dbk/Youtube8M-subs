00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello everyone and in this video we are with you 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.040
 we will receive hydrogen chloride that is already 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:16.340
 chlorine in the bulb as you can see and 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.650
 there is a small amount 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 bottom flask food salt sodium chloride 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.099
 the flask has enough volume to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 hydrogen chloride produced in it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.009
 distributed evenly and did not bother us 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 breathe well in the room because bark 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.879
 hydrogen is not pleasant enough 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 smell and it burns the airways not 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 inhale the vapors of hydrogen chlorine and not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 gets all thief hydrogen in too 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.879
 large quantities 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 because 70 can breathe now 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:59.239
 let's add sodium chloride 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:04.589
 a drop of sulfuric acid as you see go 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:10.979
 characteristic whitish steam and I added 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:14.689
 literally a bit of sulfuric acid like 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 see in the flask we can observe 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.369
 characteristic pairs 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 how do we now determine what is in the flask 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 is hydrogen chloride i will take this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:35.909
 here's a wire with a tampon wet and and our 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.600
 thorny with alcohol and bring in our flask as 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.020
 see in the flask immediately appeared smoke that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.540
 so this smoke this smoke 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.540
 nh4 chlorine i.e. ammonium chloride 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.020
 chlorine and hydrogen combines with vapors 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.439
 ammonia 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 ammonium chloride is obtained and so 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.170
 here is the way we can determine what's 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.440
 the flask is really present 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.220
 hydrogen chloride like this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.150
 reaction 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 as you can see the smoke is starting gradually 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:26.239
 come out of the flask and why 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.630
 this smoke was generated because not ours 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.730
 4 chlorine is a solid and it is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.900
 we have formed enough shallow 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.269
 disperse us about this condition in 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.750
 As a result, we have such 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:49.760
 here is a smoke shaped suspension with solid salt 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.519
 mixture with air, that is, we are in this 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.049
 the reactions got as much chlorine that is 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.840
 hydrogen chloride we pro interacted 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.299
 bruce interacted sodium chloride and 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.660
 sulfuric acid as a result we got 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.720
 sodium sulfate and gaseous 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.650
 hydrogen chloride then chlorine gas 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.910
 hydrogen we quenched ammonia vapor and 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.500
 got magnesium chloride 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.880
 subscribe to the channel like 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.940
 A lot of new things are waiting for you 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.150
 interesting thank you for your attention everyone 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.150
 until
