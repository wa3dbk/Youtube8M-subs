generally works is since the dealers

generally works is since the dealers

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
called straw buyers come in that's

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.680 
called straw buyers come in that's
people<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.200> been<00:03:07.320> paid<00:03:07.580> $500<00:03:08.580> or<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.000> to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
people that have been paid $500 or so to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.900 
people that have been paid $500 or so to
go<00:03:09.900> into<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> car<00:03:10.620> dealership<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.520> do<00:03:11.670> buy<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
go into a car dealership and do buy a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450 
go into a car dealership and do buy a
car<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.600> then<00:03:12.750> turn<00:03:13.230> around<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.770> give<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
car and then turn around and give it to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.070 
car and then turn around and give it to
the<00:03:14.550> person<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> had<00:03:15.210> them<00:03:15.330> go<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.630> there<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
the person that had them go in there and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.590 
the person that had them go in there and
then<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> car<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.950> ultimately<00:03:17.580> exported<00:03:18.420> to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
then the car is ultimately exported to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.100 
then the car is ultimately exported to
China<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.740> so<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.360> government<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:21.930> taking

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
China and so the government is taking

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.900 
China and so the government is taking
the<00:03:22.320> position<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.830> using<00:03:23.370> these<00:03:23.550> straw

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the position that using these straw

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.540 
the position that using these straw
Briers<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:25.590> straw<00:03:25.830> buyers<00:03:26.130> will<00:03:26.520> be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
Briers and these straw buyers will be

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.950 
Briers and these straw buyers will be
telling<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> dealer<00:03:27.420> they're<00:03:27.600> not<00:03:27.750> for

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
telling the dealer they're not for

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.540 
telling the dealer they're not for
export<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.830> that's<00:03:29.070> making<00:03:29.460> a

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
export that that's making a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.480 
export that that's making a
misrepresentation<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.980> still<00:03:32.250> has<00:03:32.460> to

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
misrepresentation but it still has to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.590 
misrepresentation but it still has to
cause<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.360> dealer<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:34.440> lose<00:03:34.740> money<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.600> so

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
cause the dealer to lose money and so

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.420 
cause the dealer to lose money and so
the<00:03:36.720> government's<00:03:37.200> theory<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.160> just

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the government's theory and this is just

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.470 
the government's theory and this is just
a<00:03:38.580> theory<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:40.490> manufacturers<00:03:41.490> do

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
a theory is that the manufacturers do

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.510 
a theory is that the manufacturers do
what's<00:03:42.690> called<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.080> chargeback<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:44.160> they<00:03:44.310> find

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
what's called a chargeback if they find

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.460 
what's called a chargeback if they find
a<00:03:44.700> car<00:03:44.910> has<00:03:45.090> been<00:03:45.270> exported<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
a car has been exported that is the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.440 
a car has been exported that is the
dealer<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.100> subject<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.700> having<00:03:48.030> money

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
dealer is subject to having money

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.190 
dealer is subject to having money
charged<00:03:49.140> back<00:03:49.700> as<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.760> result<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.630> allowing<00:03:52.080> a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
charged back as a result of allowing a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.070 
charged back as a result of allowing a
car<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.070> exported<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.480> addition<00:03:54.990> the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
car to be exported and in addition the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.230 
car to be exported and in addition the
manufacturer<00:03:55.860> may<00:03:56.100> cut<00:03:56.400> back<00:03:56.670> on<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
manufacturer may cut back on the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.690 
manufacturer may cut back on the
allotment<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.930> future<00:03:58.320> car<00:03:58.560> purchases<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
allotment of future car purchases that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.670 
allotment of future car purchases that
that<00:03:59.970> particular<00:04:00.180> dealer<00:04:01.020> will<00:04:01.230> be<00:04:01.380> allowed

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
that particular dealer will be allowed

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.570 
that particular dealer will be allowed
so<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:03.060> theory<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.140> government<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.860> that

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
so the theory of the government is that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880 
so the theory of the government is that
that<00:04:05.880> is<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> misrepresentation<00:04:06.890> that's

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
that is a misrepresentation that's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.460 
that is a misrepresentation that's
induced<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.820> dealer<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.930> part<00:04:10.260> with

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
induced that dealer to part with

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.110 
induced that dealer to part with
something<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.010> value<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
something of value that is the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.479 
something of value that is the
chargebacks<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:13.110> well<00:04:13.320> as<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.739> cut<00:04:13.980> back<00:04:14.220> on

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
chargebacks as well as the cut back on

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.080 
chargebacks as well as the cut back on
future<00:04:14.910> allowances<00:04:15.739> now<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.220> joke<00:04:17.520> about<00:04:17.700> all

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
future allowances now the joke about all

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.690 
future allowances now the joke about all
this<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.750> dealer<00:04:19.109> isn't<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.500> victim<00:04:19.890> they

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
this is the dealer isn't a victim they

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.030 
this is the dealer isn't a victim they
know<00:04:20.850> exactly<00:04:21.390> what's<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.109> there<00:04:22.830> are

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
know exactly what's going on there are

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.550 
know exactly what's going on there are
people<00:04:23.460> going<00:04:23.669> into<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.120> dealerships<00:04:24.810> buying

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
people going into the dealerships buying

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.840 
people going into the dealerships buying
multiple<00:04:26.550> cars<00:04:26.960> for<00:04:27.960> full<00:04:28.320> retail<00:04:28.919> price<00:04:28.980> they
