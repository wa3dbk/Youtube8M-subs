dx9 war in Pocket XO 1 and XO 2 speed
ooh<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:29.529> Garten<00:00:29.860> ouch<00:00:29.980> but<00:00:30.460> I<00:00:30.490> swap<00:00:30.790> them

over to get them in the proper speed ooh
and<00:00:33.460> Garnell<00:00:34.739> speedy<00:00:35.739> who<00:00:35.830> obviously<00:00:36.040> is<00:00:36.400> blur

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and Garnell speedy who obviously is blur

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.040 
and Garnell speedy who obviously is blur
Garnell<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:38.050> obviously<00:00:38.710> Ironhide<00:00:39.809> his<00:00:40.809> name

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
Garnell is obviously Ironhide his name

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.430 
Garnell is obviously Ironhide his name
seems<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.440> come<00:00:41.559> from<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.830> mix<00:00:42.040> PTO's<00:00:42.400> obvious

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
seems to come from a mix PTO's obvious

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.479 
seems to come from a mix PTO's obvious
Garnell<00:00:44.440> seems<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.770> be<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> combination<00:00:45.460> of

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
Garnell seems to be a combination of

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.250 
Garnell seems to be a combination of
Guardian<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.180> Sentinel<00:00:46.629> which<00:00:46.989> are<00:00:47.110> both

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
Guardian and Sentinel which are both

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.540 
Guardian and Sentinel which are both
terms<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:47.800> feel<00:00:48.040> you<00:00:48.190> could<00:00:48.309> accurately

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
terms that I feel you could accurately

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.939 
terms that I feel you could accurately
apply<00:00:49.090> to<00:00:49.809> Ironhide<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.590> kind<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.800> makes

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
apply to Ironhide so it kind of makes

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.180 
apply to Ironhide so it kind of makes
sense<00:00:51.190> they<00:00:51.640> come<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.150> just<00:00:52.830> like<00:00:53.830> I'm<00:00:54.070> not

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
sense they come in just like I'm not

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.540 
sense they come in just like I'm not

esque thing blur looks a little more IDW
I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.750> Ironhide<00:01:35.079> does<00:01:35.289> but<00:01:35.820> more

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
I think that Ironhide does but more

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.569 
I think that Ironhide does but more
classic<00:01:37.240> style<00:01:37.479> we<00:01:37.659> are<00:01:37.780> getting<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:39.490> is

smaller<00:01:48.090> fall<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.210> Cybertron<00:01:49.719> designed<00:01:50.259> guys

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
smaller fall of Cybertron designed guys

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.249 
smaller fall of Cybertron designed guys
about<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.159> size<00:01:51.429> including<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.450> brutal<00:01:53.109> kiss

cool so yeah transform you can pull
speedos<00:01:59.140> gun<00:01:59.439> off<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.750> said<00:02:01.869> it's<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.229> nice

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
speedos gun off like I said it's a nice

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.840 
speedos gun off like I said it's a nice
g1<00:02:03.189> looking<00:02:03.429> blur<00:02:03.749> but<00:02:04.749> you<00:02:04.840> pop<00:02:05.049> these<00:02:05.649> off

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
g1 looking blur but you pop these off

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.950 
g1 looking blur but you pop these off
then<00:02:06.850> pick<00:02:07.090> these<00:02:07.240> right<00:02:07.390> here<00:02:07.539> flip<00:02:07.840> these

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
then pick these right here flip these

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.300 
then pick these right here flip these
around<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.740> that's<00:02:08.890> already<00:02:09.100> got

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
around you can see that's already got

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.790 
around you can see that's already got
his<00:02:09.460> hands<00:02:09.899> bring<00:02:10.899> this<00:02:11.020> whole<00:02:11.260> front<00:02:11.560> piece

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
his hands bring this whole front piece

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.820 
his hands bring this whole front piece
down<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.340> around<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.530> rotate<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> at<00:02:14.740> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
down and around and rotate it at the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.970 
down and around and rotate it at the
waist<00:02:14.980> let's<00:02:15.970> put<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> legs<00:02:16.620> rotate<00:02:17.620> them<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
waist let's put the legs rotate them so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.160 
waist let's put the legs rotate them so
the<00:02:18.130> blue<00:02:18.940> t<00:02:19.120> tailings<00:02:19.510> on<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> front<00:02:19.930> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the blue t tailings on the front and

right off will be a gap in in how this

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.559 
right off will be a gap in in how this
sits<00:03:48.859> down<00:03:49.069> once<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.090> get<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.359> start

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
sits down once you get it to start

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.120 
sits down once you get it to start
getting<00:03:50.840> everything<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:51.200> place<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.680> should<00:03:51.709> be

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
getting everything in place it should be

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.309 
getting everything in place it should be
even<00:03:52.730> if<00:03:52.819> that's<00:03:52.910> not<00:03:53.060> exactly<00:03:53.660> lined<00:03:53.989> up<00:03:54.170> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
even if that's not exactly lined up and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.870 
even if that's not exactly lined up and
kind<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.620> pushed<00:03:54.920> down<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.280> should<00:03:55.400> pop<00:03:55.609> into

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
kind of pushed down it should pop into

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.699 
kind of pushed down it should pop into
place<00:03:56.120> but<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.019> helps<00:03:57.260> if<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:57.410> have<00:03:57.470> that

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
place but it helps if you have that

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.849 
place but it helps if you have that
lined<00:03:57.950> up<00:03:58.100> close<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.180> begin<00:03:59.390> with<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.799> yeah

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
lined up close but to begin with so yeah
