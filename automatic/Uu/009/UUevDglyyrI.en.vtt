00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
craft for example feels very heavy it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.399 
craft for example feels very heavy it
probably<00:01:28.740> weighs<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.430> pound<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.450> half<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
some of our crabs will even get up to

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.450 
some of our crabs will even get up to
two<00:01:33.299> pounds<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.290> reason<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.830> want<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.130> heavy

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.410 
two pounds the reason you want a heavy
crab<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.200> fully<00:01:37.710> its<00:01:38.700> shell<00:01:39.090> has

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
crab is because it's fully its shell has

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.500 
crab is because it's fully its shell has
fully<00:01:39.930> formed<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.310> meat<00:01:41.549> inside<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510

the water in the ocean starts getting
warmer<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> crabs<00:01:58.110> themselves

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
warmer and then the crabs themselves

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.820 
warmer and then the crabs themselves
start<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.490> mult<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.030> their<00:02:00.689> shells<00:02:01.110> start<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
start to mult and their shells start to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.330 
start to mult and their shells start to
dissolve<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> new<00:02:03.000> shell<00:02:03.299> under<00:02:03.810> there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
dissolve and the new shell under there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
dissolve and the new shell under there
becomes<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> old<00:02:05.939> shell<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.229> why<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
becomes the old shell so that's why you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.729 
becomes the old shell so that's why you
want<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> pick<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> crab<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.299> very<00:02:09.810> firm<00:02:10.319> and
