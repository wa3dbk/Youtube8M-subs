00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.849
 on-line 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 here very well I love that written 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.680
 You have written me after being red, not 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.680
 wear blue for everything 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.300
 neither one nor two nor three nor eggs and 3 and already 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 triple looping yes yes yes yes yes so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 let's see if we had it in stereo 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.280
 and a kid that is treated with trunk 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.110
 worth it is worth it seems that the logs are 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.340
 they swallow the people in this forest the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.840
 forest of trunks swallows people 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.550
 comrades are going to catch we are going to catch 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.140
 until then hai you create air that is a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 tonic the trunks take care that I told you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.579
 guys because we have here as I say a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 'triple-double' and see how we spent 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.469
 this is as good as here we have the tro 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.760
 from behind stuck we have the trio behind 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.530
 Perez has sounded that sounds a little 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.730
 well no matter if it's worth herrera 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.110
 a trio behind but because they are three 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.150
 madryn ya miami 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.160
 and my oil language but my tongue my 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.420
 sunny that is happening not everything has 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.590
 meaning but nothing makes sense you know 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.320
 like something strange 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.540
 eye eye because we go first and they are 20 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.040
 checkpoints will deny them shorter 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.660
 well but this will stay compare 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.550
 with the triple the pin that you have to give to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.800
 your dad we know this is thinking about doing it 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.300
 interest in the first person but first 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.670
 I will try in third why then 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.250
 because it comes from basically I 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.320
 pursues the guy with glasses and cool 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.280
 so eye has really intimate purple 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 do not leave them forward simply because 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 mola me but not for long 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 here 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:01.210
 a little more 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.210
 besides the eye 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 iTunes 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.069
 this man what kind of problematic is 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.109
 puts to the pine in the looping 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.700
 if I can do the gib as it is 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:20.499
 I could do it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:26.409
 and after 13 minutes and in seconds 5 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:26.409
 4 3 2 1 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.829
 and look at how he works there's a guy who ends up 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.359
 finishes arrested two people so 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.120
 so much just jump the counter the 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.189
 Jan Efe knocks on you Louis Pierre gives me 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.810
 I do not care, it's not going to be good 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.450
 Well, we're back here and we're going 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.040
 with the third attempt already or already the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.500
 Subscribers have left me with two 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.959
 times a one race that have been 13 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.459
 minutes and transit 5 and in all 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 writers have passed the first I do not 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.519
 I know what's up guys, there are things that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.769
 you can get in life to know 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:06.310
 how to get to this harder than 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:15.140
 become a site but not 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.510
 his mother was traveling for 30 minutes 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.380
 here, guys 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 30 controls or another writer is going to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.990
 see that you have to think positive you have to 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.300
 think of nature nothing is going to you 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.820
 to reach the goal there the one that is going to arrive 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.200
 to the goal already and we will win 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.470
 my mother I do not know how I'm doing 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.470
 this 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.950
 you have to think about the nature you have to 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.650
 think about the plants in life in the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.970
 beaches in the beautiful things of life and 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.240
 well I'll have it like that but where did 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.240
 appears 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.239
 ah 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.959
 nothing 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.959
 if the same goes we're going 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.669
 with if I got it I got it 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.669
