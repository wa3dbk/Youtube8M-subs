00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.609 
but we could clearly hear the jingle
bells<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.700> video<00:02:08.390> footage<00:02:08.720> when<00:02:09.470> we

bells on the video footage when we

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:43.039 
bells on the video footage when we
turned<00:02:09.860> up<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.100> sound

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.780 

the<00:02:44.049> last<00:02:44.290> two<00:02:44.500> stockings<00:02:45.069> remaining<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the last two stockings remaining on the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.030 
the last two stockings remaining on the
right<00:02:45.970> hand<00:02:46.180> side<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.629> for<00:02:46.810> our<00:02:46.930> puppies<00:02:47.349> and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
right hand side are for our puppies and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.009 
right hand side are for our puppies and
Santa<00:02:48.670> Claus<00:02:48.819> apparently<00:02:49.420> does<00:02:49.599> both<00:02:49.840> of

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
Santa Claus apparently does both of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.350 
Santa Claus apparently does both of
these<00:02:50.140> at<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.500> same<00:02:50.560> time<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.060> could<00:02:52.180> tell

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
these at the same time as you could tell

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.940 
these at the same time as you could tell
the<00:02:52.599> milk<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> glass<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.319> pretty<00:02:53.709> much

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the milk in the glass is pretty much

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.979 
the milk in the glass is pretty much
done<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:54.790> believe<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.480> cookies<00:02:55.810> are

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
done and I believe all the cookies are

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.110 
done and I believe all the cookies are
gone<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:56.409> it's<00:02:56.530> hard<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.769> tell<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.760> daughter's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
gone but it's hard to tell my daughter's

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.339 
gone but it's hard to tell my daughter's
noticed<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:59.310> little<00:03:00.310> quicker<00:03:00.519> than<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.879> did

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.710 

and<00:03:05.349> finally<00:03:06.030> every<00:03:07.030> year<00:03:07.209> Santa<00:03:07.540> Claus

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
and finally every year Santa Claus

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.420 
and finally every year Santa Claus
leaves<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.110> little<00:03:08.230> letter<00:03:08.530> for<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.920> kids<00:03:09.159> and
