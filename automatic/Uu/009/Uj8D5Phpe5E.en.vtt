00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
really flimsy even the top the bottom

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.110 
really flimsy even the top the bottom
it's<00:02:35.630> not<00:02:35.750> saggy<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.950> covers<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> chrome

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
it's not saggy and it covers the chrome

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.910 
it's not saggy and it covers the chrome
so<00:02:38.420> I'm<00:02:38.570> not<00:02:38.750> worried<00:02:39.020> about<00:02:39.140> dropping<00:02:39.740> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
so I'm not worried about dropping and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.250 
so I'm not worried about dropping and
having<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> get<00:02:40.670> done<00:02:40.880> getting<00:02:41.540> damaged<00:02:41.960> but

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
having it get done getting damaged but

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.090 
having it get done getting damaged but
in<00:02:43.010> general<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.760> kind<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:45.080> flimsy<00:02:45.800> type

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
in general is kind of like flimsy type

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.070 
in general is kind of like flimsy type
silicon<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:47.060> just<00:02:47.270> gonna<00:02:47.480> take<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:47.840> off

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
silicon so I'm just gonna take this off

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.500 
silicon so I'm just gonna take this off
take<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.130> look<00:02:49.370> at<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.520> other<00:02:49.610> one<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.150> video

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
take a look at the other one this video

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.449 
take a look at the other one this video
would<00:02:50.690> actually<00:02:51.320> turn<00:02:51.590> out<00:02:51.620> longer<00:02:52.070> than<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
would actually turn out longer than I

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.960 
would actually turn out longer than I
thought<00:02:52.490> it'd<00:02:52.820> be<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:53.570> very<00:02:53.870> flimsy

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
thought it'd be but it's very flimsy

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.640 
thought it'd be but it's very flimsy
hope<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.150> other<00:02:56.270> ones<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.930> frenzied<00:02:57.410> so

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
hope the other ones not that frenzied so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.470 
hope the other ones not that frenzied so
put<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:57.980> aside

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
put this aside

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.690 
put this aside
check<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.690> down<00:03:05.050> okay<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.370> exact

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
check this down okay so it's the exact

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.640 
check this down okay so it's the exact
same<00:03:07.730> design<00:03:08.209> except<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> actually<00:03:09.320> kind<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
same design except it actually kind of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
same design except it actually kind of
feels<00:03:09.920> different<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.770> once<00:03:12.770> again<00:03:12.950> includes

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
feels different so once again includes

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.350 
feels different so once again includes
nothing<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.510> yeah<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.709> do<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> same<00:03:16.970> design

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
nothing and yeah so do the same design

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360 
nothing and yeah so do the same design
except<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:17.900> one's<00:03:18.110> actually<00:03:18.320> way<00:03:18.800> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
except this one's actually way the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.600 
except this one's actually way the
silicon<00:03:20.090> type<00:03:20.450> thing<00:03:20.870> kind<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.830> rubbery<00:03:22.250> but

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
silicon type thing kind of rubbery but

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.880 
silicon type thing kind of rubbery but
it's<00:03:22.880> way<00:03:23.209> sticker<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.959> more<00:03:24.170> stronger<00:03:24.709> which

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's way sticker and more stronger which

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.690 
it's way sticker and more stronger which
I<00:03:25.070> like<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.320> yeah<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.440> also<00:03:27.560> has<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.920> very<00:03:28.310> nice

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
I like so yeah it also has a very nice

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.070 
I like so yeah it also has a very nice
um<00:03:29.000> pattern<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.130> that's<00:03:31.459> good<00:03:32.080> so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
um pattern that I like so that's good so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920 
um pattern that I like so that's good so
let's<00:03:33.380> put<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:35.390> shouldn't<00:03:35.780> have

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
let's put this in and I shouldn't have

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.050 
let's put this in and I shouldn't have
to<00:03:36.080> teach<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.500> guys<00:03:36.530> how<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:37.010> how<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.760> put<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
to teach you guys how to how to put a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.820 
to teach you guys how to how to put a
silicone<00:03:38.540> case<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.380> know<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:41.769> yeah<00:03:42.769> you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
silicone case and you know so yeah you

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.759 
silicone case and you know so yeah you
just<00:03:42.980> wrap<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.550> around<00:03:44.019> this<00:03:45.019> one<00:03:45.260> actually

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
just wrap it around this one actually

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.130 
just wrap it around this one actually
wraps<00:03:46.070> around<00:03:46.310> more<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.330> totally

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
wraps around more it's like totally

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.790 
wraps around more it's like totally
covered<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.860> if<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.370> see<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:50.090> like

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
covered and if you can see that like

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.500 
covered and if you can see that like
there's<00:03:51.800> space<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.000> screen<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.360> protected

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
there's space so the screen is protected

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.290 
there's space so the screen is protected
which<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.410> good<00:03:54.650> actually<00:03:55.459> like<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.239> one

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
which is good actually like this one

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.710 
which is good actually like this one
better<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:57.050> it's<00:03:57.290> less<00:03:58.030> flimsy<00:03:59.030> type<00:03:59.390> so<00:03:59.690> I

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
better like it's less flimsy type so I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.580 
better like it's less flimsy type so I
can<00:04:00.019> do<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.440> without<00:04:00.950> any<00:04:01.160> worries<00:04:02.380> kids<00:04:03.380> out

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
can do this without any worries kids out

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.400 
can do this without any worries kids out
here<00:04:03.620> better<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.580> here<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.510> doesn't<00:04:05.840> say<00:04:06.049> at

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
here better and here it doesn't say at

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.810 
here better and here it doesn't say at
all<00:04:06.940> like<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.180> pretty<00:04:08.540> nice<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.820> but

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
all like it's pretty nice so but

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.000 
all like it's pretty nice so but
remember<00:04:11.330> guys<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.019> originally<00:04:12.739> for<00:04:12.950> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
remember guys this is originally for the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.060 
remember guys this is originally for the
iPhone<00:04:13.430> 1st<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.030> 2nd<00:04:14.570> gen<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.350> will<00:04:15.530> not<00:04:15.769> be

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
iPhone 1st and 2nd gen so it will not be

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.140 
iPhone 1st and 2nd gen so it will not be
as<00:04:16.220> perfect<00:04:16.760> as<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.390> would<00:04:17.690> on<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.049> frisson<00:04:18.530> I

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
as perfect as it would on the frisson I

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.240 
as perfect as it would on the frisson I
might<00:04:20.150> do<00:04:20.299> video<00:04:20.690> comparing<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.650> on<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.950> first

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
might do video comparing it on the first

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.320 
might do video comparing it on the first
gen<00:04:22.550> but<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:23.030> don't

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
gen but I don't

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.200 
gen but I don't
it<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.629> gave<00:04:24.050> my<00:04:24.289> iPhone<00:04:24.830> away<00:04:25.099> so<00:04:25.689> there<00:04:26.689> it<00:04:26.840> is

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
it I gave my iPhone away so there it is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.110 
it I gave my iPhone away so there it is
fix<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.449> not<00:04:29.659> bad<00:04:30.159> but<00:04:31.159> what<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.969> about

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
fix it not bad but what I like about

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.300 
fix it not bad but what I like about
this<00:04:32.419> one<00:04:32.629> is<00:04:32.870> if<00:04:33.199> you<00:04:33.319> can<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:33.889> that<00:04:34.129> it

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
this one is if you can see that it

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.520 
this one is if you can see that it
actually<00:04:34.460> sticks<00:04:35.000> out<00:04:35.240> more<00:04:35.449> which<00:04:35.990> makes<00:04:36.319> it

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
actually sticks out more which makes it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.830 
actually sticks out more which makes it
more<00:04:36.680> button<00:04:37.069> sensitive<00:04:37.699> type<00:04:38.030> which<00:04:38.629> I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
more button sensitive type which I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.670 
more button sensitive type which I
really<00:04:39.319> like<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.599> here<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.840> same<00:04:42.259> is<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
really like and here the same is the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.619 
really like and here the same is the
power<00:04:42.919> button<00:04:43.069> sticks<00:04:43.759> out<00:04:43.969> more<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.479> it's

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
power button sticks out more so it's
