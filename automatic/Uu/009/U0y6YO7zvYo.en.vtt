I'm going to show you how to make a very

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.079 
I'm going to show you how to make a very
healing<00:00:12.230> nail<00:00:13.230> strengthening<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.400> well<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
healing nail strengthening as well as a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.450 
healing nail strengthening as well as a
cuticle<00:00:15.660> oil<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.049> two<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.680> product<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
cuticle oil it's two in one product and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.240 
cuticle oil it's two in one product and
so<00:00:18.359> there's<00:00:18.539> no<00:00:18.720> need<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.650> nail<00:00:19.920> oil

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
so there's no need to have a nail oil

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
so there's no need to have a nail oil
and<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> cuticle<00:00:20.910> oil<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.480> will<00:00:21.720> strengthen

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and a cuticle oil this will strengthen

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.410 
and a cuticle oil this will strengthen
the<00:00:22.289> nails<00:00:22.529> as<00:00:22.800> well<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.609> moisturize<00:00:24.210> the

the nails as well as moisturize the
cuticles<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.859> completely<00:00:26.490> organic<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
cuticles and it's completely organic and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
cuticles and it's completely organic and
it's<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> fraction<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> cost<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.090> ones<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's a fraction of the cost of ones that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's a fraction of the cost of ones that
you<00:00:30.660> would<00:00:30.810> buy<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> drugstore<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> let's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
may seem expensive upfront but they can

may seem expensive upfront but they can
last<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.300> long<00:00:54.510> long<00:00:54.780> time

last a long long time

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
last a long long time
for<00:00:56.100> example<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.670> lime<00:00:56.940> peel<00:00:57.270> oil<00:00:57.449> from

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
for example this lime peel oil from

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
for example this lime peel oil from
Mountain<00:00:58.079> Rose<00:00:58.230> herbs<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.829> less<00:00:59.070> than<00:00:59.280> ten

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Mountain Rose herbs it's less than ten

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
Mountain Rose herbs it's less than ten
dollars<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.719> last<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.320> long<00:01:01.649> time

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
dollars and this will last a long time

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.600 
dollars and this will last a long time
and<00:01:02.930> olive<00:01:03.930> oil<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> probably<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.309> hand

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and olive oil you probably have on hand

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.460 
and olive oil you probably have on hand
in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> house<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.930> thing<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
in the house this is one thing that a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
in the house this is one thing that a
lot<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.770> people<00:01:08.130> don't<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.210> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
lot of people don't have and it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
lot of people don't have and it's
bioplasma<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.670> toothpaste<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.689> use

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
bioplasma I use it for toothpaste I use

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
bioplasma I use it for toothpaste I use
it<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> take<00:01:13.320> orally<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> topically

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it to take orally and I use it topically

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.289 
it to take orally and I use it topically
because<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.840> brings<00:01:16.140> balance<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because it brings balance to all the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
because it brings balance to all the
minerals<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.900> body<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.470> 12<00:01:20.060> mineral

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
minerals in your body it's 12 mineral

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.300 
minerals in your body it's 12 mineral
salts<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:22.430> are<00:01:23.659> naturally<00:01:24.659> occurring<00:01:24.810> in

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
salts that are naturally occurring in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310 
salts that are naturally occurring in
our<00:01:26.310> bodies<00:01:26.700> anyway<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.110> bring

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
our bodies anyway so this will bring

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
our bodies anyway so this will bring
balance<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.250> those<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.540> good

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
balance to those and it's a very good

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
balance to those and it's a very good
source<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.520> minerals<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.600> nails<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> I'm

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
source of minerals for the nails so I'm

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
source of minerals for the nails so I'm
gonna<00:01:35.400> use<00:01:35.640> also<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> nail<00:01:36.540> oil<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.710> right

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
gonna use also in the nail oil all right

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
gonna use also in the nail oil all right
so<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.430> simple<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.540> gonna

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689

so it's pretty simple all you're gonna
do<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.439> yourself<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.979> nice<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.369> bottle

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
do is get yourself a nice little bottle

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
do is get yourself a nice little bottle
I<00:01:41.880> usually<00:01:42.299> keep<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> Rescue<00:01:43.860> Remedy

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I usually keep this was a Rescue Remedy

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
I usually keep this was a Rescue Remedy
bottle<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.640> usually<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.329> my<00:01:45.360> bottles<00:01:45.899> and

bottle I usually keep all my bottles and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
bottle I usually keep all my bottles and
then<00:01:46.170> sterilize<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> nice

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
then sterilize them and this has a nice

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.300 
then sterilize them and this has a nice
dropper<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> end<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.500> use<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.070> for

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
dropper on the end so you can use it for

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.960 
dropper on the end so you can use it for
your<00:01:50.490> nails<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.079> you're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.740> fill<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
almost all the way to the top you're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399 
almost all the way to the top you're
probably<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> 3/4<00:01:57.329> fill<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:58.380> your

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
probably going to 3/4 fill it with your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:07.279

of<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:52.830> think<00:03:53.830> it<00:03:54.070> might<00:03:54.220> have<00:03:54.340> been<00:03:54.400> 6

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
of this I think it might have been 6

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.900 
of this I think it might have been 6
that's<00:03:55.420> okay<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.110> am<00:03:56.860> we're<00:03:57.010> almost<00:03:57.190> done<00:03:57.640> so

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
four but I'm gonna use two for this size

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.320

bottle<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.240> these<00:04:04.930> little<00:04:05.260> bio<00:04:05.470> plasma<00:04:06.330> cell

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
bottle of these little bio plasma cell

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.930 
bottle of these little bio plasma cell
salts<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:07.960> they<00:04:08.440> are<00:04:08.770> very<00:04:09.160> rich<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.670> minerals

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
salts and they are very rich in minerals

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.660 
salts and they are very rich in minerals
and<00:04:10.420> which<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.050> essential<00:04:11.560> for<00:04:11.590> strong<00:04:12.310> nails

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
and which is essential for strong nails

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.130 
and which is essential for strong nails
so<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> think<00:04:14.610> let's<00:04:15.610> go<00:04:15.790> with<00:04:15.970> four<00:04:16.239> there's<00:04:17.020> no

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
so I think let's go with four there's no

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.210 
so I think let's go with four there's no
real<00:04:17.380> science<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:20.680> right<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.070> I'm

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
real science to this all right so I'm

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.130 
real science to this all right so I'm
gonna<00:04:21.430> crush<00:04:21.730> those<00:04:22.030> four<00:04:22.480> up<00:04:22.780> and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
gonna crush those four up and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.370 
gonna crush those four up and
essentially<00:04:23.919> all<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:25.210> put<00:04:25.960> them<00:04:26.110> in<00:04:26.260> a

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
essentially all I do is put them in a

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.580 
essentially all I do is put them in a
little<00:04:26.560> container<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:28.200> pay<00:04:29.200> them<00:04:29.350> with<00:04:29.470> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
little container and pay them with the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.350 
little container and pay them with the
butt<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.980> knife<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.460> they<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.760> turn<00:04:31.120> into

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
butt of a knife and they just turn into

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.610 
butt of a knife and they just turn into
a<00:04:31.419> powder<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:34.540> can<00:04:34.690> use<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.900> mortar<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.380> pestle

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.590 
a powder you can use a mortar and pestle
my<00:04:36.310> mortar<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.730> pestle<00:04:36.970> smells<00:04:37.930> like<00:04:39.600> cumin

right now so I kind of don't want to use

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.860 
right now so I kind of don't want to use
