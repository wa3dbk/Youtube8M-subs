00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.109
 or the one that I want to teach to do this 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.179
 sheet lamp made with paper and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.600
 You will be surprised how easy it is to do 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:17.050
 and the few materials that we will require 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 The materials we will use are a 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.970
 toilet paper roll white glue 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 and water in the same amounts a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:32.710
 brush a big balloon for party paper 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.330
 Corrugated crepe and fine wire first 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.350
 we will have to make a sphere of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.180
 paper for it we will start the globe 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.720
 and we will attach them to some container 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.810
 so that it does not move so much 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.670
 Y 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.660
 then we will mix the water with the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.660
 white glue 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.900
 and then we will take squares of the paper 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.240
 of bath and we will stick it to the balloon one 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.570
 side by side on riding alone 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.180
 a little 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.370
 you will have to cover all the paper with the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.010
 white glue so that then when 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.420
 dry, keep the shape 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.550
 this you will have to do with the whole globe 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.310
 and then let it dry for a whole 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.260
 day you can also replace all this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.260
 process buying a china lamp 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.619
 when they have dried you will have to make a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.360
 little hole in the balloon so that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.250
 this one deflates very carefully 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.439
 then we will cut the edge so that this one 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.630
 it is quite straight to cut as pretty 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.570
 Well, we will only need a little more 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.700
 Half the sphere 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.690
 but at the top we will have to 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.940
 to make a hole 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.170
 this must be the size of the mouthpiece 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.170
 of the focus that we are going to use 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 and now we will make the sheets for it 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.290
 we will take the crepe paper and fold it 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 so there is a strip of 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.479
 approximately 10 centimeters wide 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.090
 then we will only have to cut 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 when you have this land we will double it 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.620
 in four equal parts 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.190
 in this square that I 'll keep you 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.930
 have to draw a sheet in the way that you 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 you like 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.780
 then we'll just have to cut through 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.780
 this outline 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 Y 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.120
 now we will take the wire and cut 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.920
 a piece of the top of the leaf and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.000
 we will proceed to stick the wire in the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.000
 center of the leaf 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.860
 and we will make the wire is in the middle 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.860
 bent 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 we will turn around and mark the line 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.690
 central where is the wire so that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.250
 resembles even more a leaf like 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.800
 will widen the edges to avoid 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.260
 it's so flat we do this because 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.940
 it's a corrugated paper but if you're 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.640
 using another one you can jump out of this 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.500
 step these are the ones you have to do 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.160
 as many as you need to fill the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.840
 paper sphere 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.840
 and you can also decorate them 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.710
 then all that's left is to paste these sheets 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.680
 the paper balloon starting from the 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.810
 lower part take your time and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.260
 paste them in the right place so that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.810
 they look very good and as you saw is a 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.370
 super simple to do and see 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 very well once placed 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.459
 and finally to place it 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.870
 you just have to pass the mouthpiece of 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.440
 focus for the gap we made 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.880
 previously and screw it directly 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.530
 and remember to use the spotlights 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.380
 savers these that are colored 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.290
 white since they generate very little heat that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.330
 apart they consume very little energy too 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.190
 You can use led lighting that 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.980
 It would be the right thing to do and like the video 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.440
 if you liked sharing it and do not forget 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.610
 leave your opinion below and see you 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.610
 in a next video tutorial
