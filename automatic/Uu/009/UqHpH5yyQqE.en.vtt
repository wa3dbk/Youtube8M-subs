00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.000
 Become a place 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.730
 Though it is difference with Toyota 86 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.650
 Well this might be many people know quite everyone 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.250
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.059
 It is the front It is suspension It is this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.090
 It is 86 when compared with software 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.670
 And 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:49.790
 There is such a difference that brz is slightly stiffer 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.290
 Balance when the gear is referred to in the front but as I relationship is that although I know well the same in 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.079
 Because will change 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:01.730
 It is set that 86 people take out a little roll when they are members 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.790
 Though I know the plot, such as is it is a little Gororu the body 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.560
 By setting the front to roll a little 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.100
 I have created such a characteristic that the direction is changeable 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.720
 On the other hand even though it is what brz Subaru to in 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.060
 When you turn on the corner 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:27.550
 So stick to the quite right and the ground is not so much the front roll 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.770
 The difference of personality not You're such a place to try to turning it will come out to 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.170
 Oh dear 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 Many people are 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.229
 I feel it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.690
 I felt that the Toyota 86 was more fluttered 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.400
 Subaru brz is better 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is a place that feels in such a difference that the plan is stable 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:53.380
 Well, this is the difference between corporate culture or the thought for the movement of the sports car 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.230
 I think it seems like there is something like 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.700
 Well in the first place cars 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.909
 Hey out of the way because it is a fr sports car 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.600
 Both 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.360
 For example , let it drift 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.560
 Such driving is possible, but it is the process to reach there, at that time 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.460
 What kind of driver 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.460
 Do you feel the feeling or that point treatment 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.630
 about 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:29.410
 It can be said that there is a difference of Subaru 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:33.100
 The Although the low center of gravity are you listening to this it is is surprisingly is actually of rain it's like now 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.440
 There is the fact that Do not have quite worked on the road 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.920
 Again it is also to say that since the mounting position of the engine is very low 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 I also talked that it can be sunny and soft . 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.420
 There is almost no role, so that part is very expensive 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 It is quite remarkable compared to other cars , for example, it uses the same fr 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.460
 Pacha Roadster Compared to something like this 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.830
 The movement of that front is very 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.700
 It piled up by I'm determined to have come 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:12.050
 By comparison, the Roadster is still when it enters a turn 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 It is close, but it can be understood that there is a moving part on the front processing Grab It is horizontal 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:20.819
 When I'm greatness of the counter say that I have is why bet that any good at the time of the rain and the rain of the road surface 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.409
 I still have the impression that it is slippery 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.069
 At that time, there is a sense that the nose will enter firmly against the corner 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.370
 is not it 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:33.790
 So give it to the public 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.739
 I wonder if it will come to the end. It is true that such feeling is mostly used 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.520
 It is safe except that you can drive in the rain with this 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.690
 This attraction is also 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.140
 It is a new discovery 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:55.420
 That's it together with the brz 86. The transmission is with a 6-speed manual. 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:04:02.230
 D tee both the six-speed I is also available but 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:04.569
 If you can, I recommend you naturally mt It's still a pleasure to operate such a car 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.760
 Things are 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.850
 Sports because'll controls to just no doubt the high speed It is my 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.060
 Along with Keep driving leads to high joy than I Is 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.120
 If you can do it, you still like mt 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.880
 It 's really bad to say that it is bad 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:31.340
 At ride very much this time with features of brz 86 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.840
 For example, the odd response is very fast and it's fine. 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.820
 Because it will be well early 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.110
 It seems that manual operation is surprisingly well done 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.600
 It said in Asoyuu part 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.850
 There is a reason 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.720
 So by no means it's not because I can not enjoy the sport 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.930
 is not it 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.130
 I think it's pretty good 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.610
 And in fact I also changed the at the reason why still 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:05.009
 Well there are also some people who want to get on 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.189
 and the You're good at can, for example, celebration 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:11.180
 I'm just dissatisfied when I went 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:14.470
 To the fact that there is it about things 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.470
 I bought a key 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:29.640
 Yes, I 've been riding Subaru's brz but it's a real joint I felt it 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:35.070
 It is this car It was thought that it was very up to that brain na 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:39.910
 I think in the sports car very much thinking about various things and taking ground form well 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:44.230
 It is also the part that but I'm a car that has been made quite stuck 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:48.250
 There is, of course, one thing, but you can also use it casually. 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.520
 It's a place you can do It seems easy to use 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:59.930
 I thought that it was a good place Oh 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:02.700
 Of course it is very high level but it is this 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:09.270
 I actually stopped my life and designated it as a short 2 item 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:10.710
 Really something You might also You're that convinced can part at the time was considered to use in daily life 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.870
 I can use it without me 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.870
 It seems that it is a good place to have a buddy-like part
