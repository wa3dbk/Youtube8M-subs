we're going to discuss some in-depth
strategies<00:00:20.380> on<00:00:20.849> offensive<00:00:21.849> gameplay<00:00:22.390> for

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
strategies on offensive gameplay for

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.510 
strategies on offensive gameplay for
inversion<00:00:23.169> alright<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.220> let's<00:00:24.400> talk<00:00:24.460> about

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
inversion alright so let's talk about

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.010 
inversion alright so let's talk about
the<00:00:24.700> graveling<00:00:25.060> first<00:00:25.329> I<00:00:25.480> mean<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.689> gravel

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
the graveling first I mean the gravel

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.510 
the graveling first I mean the gravel
inc<00:00:26.110> is<00:00:26.230> what<00:00:26.380> everybody<00:00:26.800> is<00:00:26.890> always<00:00:27.099> asking

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
inc is what everybody is always asking

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.010 
inc is what everybody is always asking
about<00:00:27.730> right<00:00:27.939> gramlich<00:00:28.509> is<00:00:28.599> essentially

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
about right gramlich is essentially

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.749 
about right gramlich is essentially
what's<00:00:29.259> gonna<00:00:29.380> let<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.739> command<00:00:30.130> gravity<00:00:30.640> I

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
what's gonna let you command gravity I

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.920 
what's gonna let you command gravity I
mean<00:00:31.060> you're<00:00:31.210> gonna<00:00:31.329> always<00:00:31.570> have<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:31.899> with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
mean you're gonna always have it with

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.930 
mean you're gonna always have it with
you<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.860> have<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.100> with<00:00:33.130> you<00:00:33.220> pretty<00:00:33.640> much<00:00:33.730> at

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
you you have it with you pretty much at

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.340 
you you have it with you pretty much at
the<00:00:33.970> start<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.329> game<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:34.930> take<00:00:35.230> it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
the start of the game and you take it

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.590 
the start of the game and you take it
from<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.649> enemy<00:00:35.920> take<00:00:36.370> it<00:00:36.520> use<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:37.000> as<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.120> tool

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
from the enemy take it use it as a tool

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.820 
from the enemy take it use it as a tool
of<00:00:37.630> the<00:00:37.840> range<00:00:38.079> right<00:00:38.290> it's<00:00:38.470> going<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.650> let<00:00:38.740> you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
of the range right it's going to let you

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.070 
of the range right it's going to let you
do<00:00:38.950> all<00:00:38.980> these<00:00:39.310> cool<00:00:39.490> things<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:40.060> grab<00:00:40.870> link

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
do all these cool things and grab link

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.290 
do all these cool things and grab link
itself<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.620> actually<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.340> weapon<00:00:42.640> so<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.090> grab

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
itself is actually a weapon so the grab

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.790 
itself is actually a weapon so the grab
link<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.660> weapon<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.230> just<00:00:44.410> in<00:00:44.530> case<00:00:44.620> you

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
link is a weapon so just in case you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.900 
link is a weapon so just in case you
didn't<00:00:44.980> know<00:00:45.040> use<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.310> graph<00:00:45.640> link

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
didn't know use the graph link

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.760 
didn't know use the graph link
experiment<00:00:46.540> with<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.750> pick<00:00:46.960> things<00:00:47.140> up<00:00:47.380> and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
experiment with the pick things up and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.710 
experiment with the pick things up and
show<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.220> all<00:00:48.310> around<00:00:48.580> let's<00:00:49.210> talk<00:00:49.360> about<00:00:49.540> the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
show it all around let's talk about the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.420 
show it all around let's talk about the
combinations<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.410> you<00:00:50.530> can<00:00:50.770> use<00:00:51.010> with<00:00:51.340> the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
combinations that you can use with the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.460 
combinations that you can use with the
gravel<00:00:51.760> inc<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.090> right<00:00:52.570> now<00:00:52.600> an<00:00:52.870> example<00:00:53.440> that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
gravel inc so right now an example that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.380 
gravel inc so right now an example that
i<00:00:53.590> want<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.890> jump<00:00:54.040> into<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:55.000> use<00:00:55.150> of<00:00:55.180> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
i want to jump into is the use of the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.840 
i want to jump into is the use of the
gravel<00:00:55.780> inc<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.050> low<00:00:56.950> gravity<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.700> the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
gravel inc and low gravity so the

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.550 
gravel inc and low gravity so the
gravelly<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.450> for<00:00:58.840> cheating<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.380> can't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
gravelly is for cheating and you can't

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.080 
gravelly is for cheating and you can't
use<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.800> gravelly<00:01:00.130> anywhere<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.579> want<00:01:00.820> what

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
use the gravelly anywhere you want what

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.430 
use the gravelly anywhere you want what
you<00:01:01.180> have<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.390> do<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.079> have<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.230> kind<00:01:02.320> of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
you have to do is you have to kind of

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.979 
you have to do is you have to kind of
plan<00:01:02.650> on<00:01:02.829> exactly<00:01:03.220> where<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.820> how<00:01:04.449> best<00:01:04.809> to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
plan on exactly where and how best to

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.020 
plan on exactly where and how best to
users<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:05.650> for<00:01:05.860> example<00:01:05.950> when<00:01:06.939> you're

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
users so for example when you're

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.010 
users so for example when you're
starting<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.509> game<00:01:07.689> you're<00:01:07.869> probably

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
starting on the game you're probably

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.050 
starting on the game you're probably
gonna<00:01:08.200> have<00:01:08.290> about<00:01:08.590> two<00:01:08.860> or<00:01:09.070> three<00:01:09.340> shots<00:01:09.610> of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
gonna have about two or three shots of

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.090 
gonna have about two or three shots of
low<00:01:10.630> gravity<00:01:10.899> so<00:01:11.409> what<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.649> can<00:01:11.770> do<00:01:11.859> is<00:01:12.009> you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
low gravity so what you can do is you

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.099 
low gravity so what you can do is you
can<00:01:12.130> use<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.579> on<00:01:12.909> that<00:01:13.270> sniper<00:01:13.630> that's

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
can use that on that sniper that's

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.899 
can use that on that sniper that's
hiding<00:01:14.380> behind<00:01:14.679> cover<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.399> pull<00:01:15.609> up<00:01:15.759> on<00:01:15.880> a

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
hiding behind cover you can pull up on a

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.719 
hiding behind cover you can pull up on a
cover<00:01:16.179> and<00:01:16.600> then<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.289> can<00:01:17.469> use<00:01:17.829> that<00:01:17.979> as<00:01:18.189> a<00:01:18.609> way

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
cover and then you can use that as a way

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.849 
cover and then you can use that as a way
to<00:01:18.850> distract<00:01:19.359> them<00:01:19.539> his<00:01:20.020> aim<00:01:20.319> isn't<00:01:20.560> gonna<00:01:20.710> be

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
to distract them his aim isn't gonna be

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.919 
to distract them his aim isn't gonna be
as<00:01:20.950> good<00:01:21.179> later<00:01:22.179> on<00:01:22.389> once<00:01:22.569> you<00:01:22.689> get<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> little

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
as good later on once you get a little

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.840 
as good later on once you get a little
bit<00:01:23.079> better<00:01:23.200> obviously<00:01:23.530> put<00:01:24.460> them<00:01:24.579> up<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
bit better obviously put them up in the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.120 
bit better obviously put them up in the
low<00:01:24.969> gravity<00:01:25.179> and<00:01:25.869> then<00:01:26.049> mini<00:01:26.289> grab<00:01:26.530> an<00:01:26.649> object

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
low gravity and then mini grab an object

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.499 
low gravity and then mini grab an object
out<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.460> environment<00:01:27.939> throw<00:01:28.179> it<00:01:28.329> at<00:01:28.420> them

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
out of the environment throw it at them

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.359 
out of the environment throw it at them
for<00:01:28.749> one<00:01:28.960> shot<00:01:29.139> kill<00:01:29.380> that's<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:29.950> really<00:01:30.219> really

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
for one shot kill that's a really really

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.830 
for one shot kill that's a really really
cool<00:01:30.490> thing<00:01:30.819> now<00:01:30.969> lets<00:01:31.179> you<00:01:31.420> know<00:01:31.479> we<00:01:31.600> touch<00:01:31.810> a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
cool thing now lets you know we touch a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.959 
cool thing now lets you know we touch a
little<00:01:32.079> bit<00:01:32.170> up<00:01:32.409> on<00:01:32.590> low<00:01:33.189> gravity<00:01:33.460> let's<00:01:33.789> fill

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
little bit up on low gravity let's fill

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.520 
little bit up on low gravity let's fill
them<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.119> on<00:01:34.210> high<00:01:34.509> like<00:01:34.899> what's<00:01:35.109> a<00:01:35.259> cool

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
them in on high like what's a cool

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.550 
them in on high like what's a cool
situational<00:01:36.459> thing<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.850> I'll<00:01:37.209> be<00:01:37.509> put<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:37.959> to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
situational thing that I'll be put in to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.980 
situational thing that I'll be put in to
one<00:01:38.829> opt<00:01:39.100> out<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:39.789> high<00:01:40.090> gravity<00:01:40.359> so<00:01:40.869> high

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
one opt out to use high gravity so high

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.389 
one opt out to use high gravity so high
gravity<00:01:41.259> what<00:01:41.560> that's<00:01:41.709> going<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:41.889> do<00:01:42.069> is<00:01:42.219> going

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
gravity what that's going to do is going

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.039 
gravity what that's going to do is going
to<00:01:42.459> increase<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.030> weight<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.509> know<00:01:43.719> three<00:01:44.020> or

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
to increase the weight you know three or

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.840 
to increase the weight you know three or
four<00:01:44.350> times<00:01:44.590> once<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:45.069> hit<00:01:45.189> an<00:01:45.310> enemy<00:01:45.429> with<00:01:45.700> it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
four times once you hit an enemy with it

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.639 
four times once you hit an enemy with it
you'll<00:01:46.030> see<00:01:46.179> them<00:01:46.270> stuck<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.109> the<00:01:47.229> ground<00:01:47.350> and

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
you'll see them stuck to the ground and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.199 
you'll see them stuck to the ground and
kind<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:47.889> struggling<00:01:48.189> we've<00:01:48.609> got<00:01:48.759> about<00:01:48.850> five

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
kind of struggling we've got about five

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.969 
kind of struggling we've got about five
seconds<00:01:49.719> to<00:01:49.959> decide<00:01:50.380> what<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.619> want<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.859> do

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
seconds to decide what you want to do

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.830 
seconds to decide what you want to do
with<00:01:51.100> them<00:01:51.219> at<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.429> point<00:01:51.639> so<00:01:52.329> for<00:01:52.749> example

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
with them at that point so for example

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.359 
with them at that point so for example

that means grenades they don't land they

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.199 
that means grenades they don't land they
go<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:23.890> float<00:02:24.129> until<00:02:24.280> they<00:02:24.459> blow<00:02:24.609> up<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.060> how

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
go and float until they blow up so how

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.190 
go and float until they blow up so how
am<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.329> going<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.540> kill<00:02:25.750> people<00:02:25.920> ease<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.099> way

am I going to kill people ease this way

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.479 
am I going to kill people ease this way
instead<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.409> trying<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.590> flank<00:02:29.769> them<00:02:29.920> okay<00:02:30.340> can

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
instead of trying to flank them okay can

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.460 
instead of trying to flank them okay can
flag<00:02:30.670> them<00:02:30.700> normally<00:02:31.180> right<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.109> can<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.409> of

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
flag them normally right you can kind of

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.720 
flag them normally right you can kind of
bounce<00:02:32.650> between<00:02:32.859> objects<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.640> the

playing on two different playing fields

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.490 
playing on two different playing fields
I<00:03:06.909> get<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.329> same<00:03:07.540> type<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.780> component<00:03:08.169> and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
I get the same type of component and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.229 
I get the same type of component and
having<00:03:09.099> everything<00:03:09.400> work<00:03:09.730> as<00:03:09.939> they<00:03:10.090> normally

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
having everything work as they normally

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.170 
having everything work as they normally
would<00:03:10.659> but<00:03:10.959> with<00:03:11.200> both<00:03:11.590> priorities<00:03:12.340> mine<00:03:12.819> and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
would but with both priorities mine and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.119 
would but with both priorities mine and
yours<00:03:13.449> so<00:03:14.229> functioning<00:03:14.769> how<00:03:14.889> we<00:03:14.949> would

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
yours so functioning how we would

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.680 
yours so functioning how we would
normally<00:03:15.459> but<00:03:15.669> I<00:03:15.790> would<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.180> see<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.659> a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
normally but I would just see you on a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.240 
normally but I would just see you on a
side<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.139> wall<00:03:17.169> and<00:03:17.440> kill<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.859> mean<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.159> if

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
side of a wall and kill you I mean so if

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.399 
side of a wall and kill you I mean so if
you<00:03:18.340> see<00:03:18.549> becca<00:03:19.030> ships<00:03:19.329> aren't<00:03:19.599> just<00:03:19.840> cosmetic

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
you see becca ships aren't just cosmetic

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.659 
you see becca ships aren't just cosmetic
everything<00:03:20.949> has<00:03:21.099> completely<00:03:21.459> shifted

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
everything has completely shifted

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.280 
everything has completely shifted
enemies<00:03:22.419> are<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.629> to<00:03:22.690> be<00:03:22.780> running<00:03:22.989> at<00:03:23.169> you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
enemies are going to be running at you

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.949 
enemies are going to be running at you
from<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.500> side<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.859> wall<00:03:24.040> as<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:24.549> see

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
from the side of the wall as you can see

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.149 
from the side of the wall as you can see
now<00:03:25.959> because<00:03:26.229> of<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.470> they've<00:03:26.650> got<00:03:26.799> these

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
now because of that they've got these

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.710 
now because of that they've got these
different<00:03:27.549> angles<00:03:27.970> on<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.209> now<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:28.569> your

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
different angles on you now so your

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.939 
different angles on you now so your
normal<00:03:28.989> cover<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.349> you<00:03:29.440> thought<00:03:29.590> was<00:03:29.739> safe

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
it's not necessarily going to work it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.149 
it's not necessarily going to work it
the<00:03:31.930> right<00:03:32.079> way<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.680> they<00:03:32.799> can<00:03:32.919> get<00:03:33.010> these

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
the right way so they can get these

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.189 
the right way so they can get these
shots<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.419> covers<00:03:34.629> already
