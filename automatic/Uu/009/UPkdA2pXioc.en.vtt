00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.340
 hello friends how about greeting you again 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.210
 I'm simulating I had time that did not go up 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.030
 videos because I'm in jig playing the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.280
 gloss this is the novelty horita for me 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.620
 it is the best game of the xbox 360 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.630
 I do not know if they differ in my opinion but 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.450
 well here I am going to here I bring you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.080
 this video of a software trick 3 in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 the multiplayer of put in private and 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.850
 this one goes to the shopping map so 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 call of purchases obviously for what 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.330
 for those who have played it already 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.980
 they know which map and those that barely 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.780
 they are going to play because obviously it's called 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
 purchases this has to be at least 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 two people have to activate all 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.390
 the bots because the votes are going to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 get to do the trick 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 remember zero bots and two minimum two 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.800
 people one on each team to be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990
 can if not not going to agree 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.150
 very well here we go the first thing that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.690
 have to do here when it appears is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.370
 this activate the alarm 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.320
 let's hope that wherever he appears 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.470
 the damper of the soul although it did not come out 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.960
 always appears on the wall that is there 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.390
 to the left 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 but he did not show me I 'll see if my 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.460
 friend is waiting to activate it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 in advance good no matter you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.530
 they look for the alarm button they are where 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.770
 appear and activate it opens this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 door here where are the teles 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.800
 agreement they look for where the monitors are 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.310
 of tele and hit this departure box 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.310
 extinguisher 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.520
 although we are going to see the first step 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.009
 to do this trick 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.460
 fortunately my friend edgar helped me 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:06.270
 to be the the video this 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.810
 to be able to capture he joined me in my 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.239
 departure 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.270
 very well back there of that wall of that 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.890
 pillar is the alarm to be activated 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.050
 I did not manage to record in the video because 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.750
 This one went ahead of me but hey, he does not have 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 much much loss you seek the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 alarm button 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.120
 and then we're going to turn off the next 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.370
 fire 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 for this game it's super cool to be 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.200
 I recommend 110% advice from the first 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.200
 game 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.780
 although there is the first part 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.480
 stay with the extinguisher they give me I was going to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.590
 leave a cart with a red hat on 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.590
 30 shoots on the red 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.510
 they heard that strange noise because 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.330
 be active apart is the hat see 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.960
 does not have his parents to exploit and 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.960
 disappear 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.960
 ready let's go to the other talent point 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.030
 hat disappears that and appears in 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.340
 another place is the same simply 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.240
 change places in that window that you see 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.370
 there 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.460
 although it already came out but the song to 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.330
 hastens to distinguish as part below 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.120
 window where the frame is 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.480
 my parents just because I take care of the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.480
 activity 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.470
 and exploded 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.019
 now let's go to the next point see how 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.260
 is how it looks like it looks cool mini my 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.480
 weapon as if it were electricity wow 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.400
 it looks amazing more in the maps of 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.440
 night looks great I recommend 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.110
 compensate here now they have to go to the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.000
 truck and they have to put out the fire 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.370
 but there is a mannequin in that part 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.140
 outside that has the cane of your 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.239
 partner was going to see when he had to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.709
 extinguish the fire the truck has 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.040
 that disappearing the cane has to do 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.959
 an explosion disappears the cane or that 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.859
 already disappeared and here he saw the smoke now 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.859
 let's go to the other point 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.920
 and to see this trick is great right now 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.920
 they see him 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.669
 and it becomes fast, never check us 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.669
 points 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.560
 in no problem if I went in the order 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.200
 How is it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.290
 because now we go to a bathroom where 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.740
 they have to follow the roof staff 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.270
 leave next to the focus cable of 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.040
 bathroom then this bathroom is let 's go to the other 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.500
 and subsequently they also have to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.300
 shoot the cane 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.520
 they have to see that the cane bleeds 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.520
 but not necessarily the cane 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.730
 something that is within the ceiling bleeds and 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.730
 is 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.940
 and the cane is hidden 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.940
 in the Czech afternoon 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.770
 even if they look up to the cane something that 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.770
 I shot 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.210
 when to see to see this blood 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.970
 and now the cane is hidden now we have 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.479
 to go again where we grab the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.479
 extinguisher 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.840
 is the last step and where are they 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.090
 the televisions where the extinguisher that 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.480
 it's been on this side obviously for 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.440
 those who know the map already know 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.440
 you know the 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.610
 you already recognize on this map and you know 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.419
 where is everything 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.400
 ok and this is the last step we have to 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.540
 turn this off here 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.979
 in agreement it turns it off and finishes paying the 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.630
 missing in extinguishers that are going to be 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.410
 That door did not leave a smoke 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.340
 they denied the extinct and surprise that 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.220
 who is going to go out there 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.740
 music was activated if you hear it is for 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.560
 that invited dancer we have from there 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.610
 I know he was not there dancing he was shot 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.639
 to disappear fast 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.990
 but if you do not shoot this value a 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.840
 fast and dancing and then disappear 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.470
 but see what the beggar is dancing 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.470
 beast that 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:39.409
 it's super cool I do not think so 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.909
