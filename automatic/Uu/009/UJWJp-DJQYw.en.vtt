00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
got a lot of questions this past season

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.570 
got a lot of questions this past season
what's<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.590> deal<00:00:21.740> with<00:00:21.920> this<00:00:22.010> blocking<00:00:22.460> high

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
what's the deal with this blocking high

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.130 
what's the deal with this blocking high
pressure<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.150> what<00:00:23.390> does<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:23.630> have<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:23.840> do

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
pressure and what does this have to do

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.690 
pressure and what does this have to do
with<00:00:24.170> affecting<00:00:24.680> surf<00:00:24.890> for<00:00:25.099> the<00:00:25.160> California

with affecting surf for the California

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.760 
with affecting surf for the California
coast<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:26.750> thought<00:00:27.050> I'd<00:00:27.200> do<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.470> picture

one that's high in the Gulf Alaska we

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.180 
one that's high in the Gulf Alaska we
can<00:00:45.230> see<00:00:45.320> another<00:00:45.530> one<00:00:45.649> that's<00:00:45.769> decided

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
can see another one that's decided

sitting<00:00:46.460> south<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.850> Aleutian<00:00:47.210> chain<00:00:47.239> is

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
sitting south the Aleutian chain is

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.360 
sitting south the Aleutian chain is
coming<00:00:47.780> out<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:47.960> western<00:00:48.289> Pacific<00:00:48.829> as<00:00:48.980> you

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
coming out of the western Pacific as you

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.979 
coming out of the western Pacific as you
move<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.640> models<00:00:49.940> forward<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.359> time<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:50.660> can

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
move the models forward in time we can

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.560 
move the models forward in time we can
see<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.350> happens<00:00:51.859> that<00:00:52.399> storm<00:00:52.969> as<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.359> comes

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
see what happens that storm as it comes

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.329 
see what happens that storm as it comes
across<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.170> Pacific<00:00:54.679> it<00:00:54.829> starts<00:00:55.190> going

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
across the Pacific it starts going

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.520 
across the Pacific it starts going
northward<00:00:55.969> into<00:00:56.179> the<00:00:56.300> Gulf<00:00:56.600> Alaska<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:57.350> here

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
northward into the Gulf Alaska so here

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.930 
northward into the Gulf Alaska so here
we've<00:00:57.739> got<00:00:57.859> one<00:00:58.070> it's<00:00:58.190> very<00:00:58.219> large<00:00:58.640> it's

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
we've got one it's very large it's

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.910 
we've got one it's very large it's
actually<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.449> system<00:00:59.780> with<00:00:59.870> about<00:00:59.989> 35<00:01:00.559> foot

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
actually a system with about 35 foot

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.099 
actually a system with about 35 foot
seas<00:01:01.280> another<00:01:01.850> one<00:01:02.089> coming<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:02.510> behind<00:01:02.719> it

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
seas another one coming in behind it

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.110 
seas another one coming in behind it
huge<00:01:03.710> that's<00:01:03.980> got<00:01:04.129> about<00:01:04.280> 40<00:01:04.610> foot<00:01:04.760> seas<00:01:04.970> but

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
huge that's got about 40 foot seas but

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.700 
huge that's got about 40 foot seas but
look<00:01:05.300> how<00:01:05.449> far<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.930> north<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.230> goes

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
look how far to the north that goes

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.649 
look how far to the north that goes
that's<00:01:07.340> way<00:01:07.670> away<00:01:07.850> from<00:01:08.000> Southern<00:01:08.480> California

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
that's way away from Southern California

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.350 
that's way away from Southern California
directing<00:01:09.620> swell<00:01:10.040> up<00:01:10.280> toward<00:01:10.580> Alaska<00:01:11.090> instead

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
directing swell up toward Alaska instead

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.710 
directing swell up toward Alaska instead
of<00:01:11.480> us<00:01:12.700> take<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.730> look<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.030> pressure<00:01:14.240> map<00:01:14.480> we

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
of us take a look at a pressure map we

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
of us take a look at a pressure map we
can<00:01:14.750> see<00:01:14.930> why<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.680> blue<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.550> high

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
can see why that is blue is high

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.219 
can see why that is blue is high
pressure<00:01:16.939> notice<00:01:17.420> how<00:01:17.540> there's<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.780> lot<00:01:18.079> of

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
pressure notice how there's a lot of

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.139 
pressure notice how there's a lot of
that<00:01:18.350> especially<00:01:18.500> off<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.340> California<00:01:19.520> moving

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
that especially off of California moving

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.389 
that especially off of California moving
up<00:01:20.240> into<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.509> Gulf<00:01:20.659> Alaska<00:01:21.380> red<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.220> low

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
up into the Gulf Alaska red that's low

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.889 
up into the Gulf Alaska red that's low
pressure<00:01:22.700> that's<00:01:22.970> associated<00:01:23.299> with<00:01:23.630> those

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
pressure that's associated with those

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.899 
pressure that's associated with those
same<00:01:24.170> swell<00:01:24.470> making<00:01:24.860> systems<00:01:25.280> at<00:01:25.700> high

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
same swell making systems at high

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.030 
same swell making systems at high
pressure<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.360> rotating<00:01:27.140> clockwise<00:01:27.170> it's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
pressure is rotating clockwise it's

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.469 
pressure is rotating clockwise it's
guiding<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.430> jet<00:01:28.610> stream<00:01:28.880> up<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.270> north

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
guiding the jet stream up to the north

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.999 
guiding the jet stream up to the north
as<00:01:29.689> we<00:01:29.810> move<00:01:29.960> these<00:01:30.079> models<00:01:30.439> forward<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.799> time

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
as we move these models forward in time

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.520 
as we move these models forward in time
we<00:01:31.219> can<00:01:31.460> see<00:01:31.790> how<00:01:32.540> that's<00:01:32.810> spinning<00:01:33.170> clockwise

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
we can see how that's spinning clockwise

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.469 
we can see how that's spinning clockwise
that's<00:01:34.159> pushing<00:01:34.640> those<00:01:34.759> storms<00:01:35.119> up<00:01:35.299> high

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
that's pushing those storms up high

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.120 
that's pushing those storms up high
instead<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.020> allowing<00:01:36.200> those<00:01:36.469> storms<00:01:36.860> then

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
instead of allowing those storms then

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.219 
instead of allowing those storms then
get<00:01:37.310> closer<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.880> our<00:01:38.030> area<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.570> throw<00:01:38.719> surf<00:01:38.960> far

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
get closer to our area to throw surf far

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.230 
get closer to our area to throw surf far
away<00:01:39.380> instead<00:01:39.829> that<00:01:40.280> high<00:01:40.640> works<00:01:41.000> as<00:01:41.210> a

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
away instead that high works as a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.450 
away instead that high works as a
blocking<00:01:41.810> pattern<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.380> keeps<00:01:42.860> pushing<00:01:43.130> those

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
blocking pattern and keeps pushing those

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.700 
blocking pattern and keeps pushing those
systems<00:01:43.969> up<00:01:44.210> far<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.689> north<00:01:44.840> affecting

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
systems up far to the north affecting

we're<00:02:21.710> in<00:02:21.830> either<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.310> El<00:02:22.460> Nino<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:22.790> La<00:02:23.000> Nina

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
we're in either in El Nino or La Nina

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.810 
we're in either in El Nino or La Nina
state<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:24.710> we<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:25.190> by<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.460> graphic

here

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.360 
here
it<00:02:26.870> looks<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.319> we're<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> lining<00:02:28.069> when<00:02:28.310> you

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it looks like we're in a lining when you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.040 
it looks like we're in a lining when you
consider<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.879> we've<00:02:29.209> got<00:02:29.420> strong<00:02:29.840> high

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
consider that we've got strong high

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.080 
consider that we've got strong high
pressure<00:02:30.080> sitting<00:02:30.739> over<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.370> eastern<00:02:31.819> part

of the Pacific guiding that polar jet
stream<00:02:34.159> up<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> north<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:35.180> it's<00:02:35.299> quite

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
stream up to the north so it's quite

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.330 
stream up to the north so it's quite
indicative<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:36.049> what<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.319> would<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.739> right

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
indicative of what we would see right

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.030 
indicative of what we would see right
now<00:02:37.549> if<00:02:37.849> we<00:02:38.060> were<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.450> La<00:02:38.629> Nina<00:02:38.659> state<00:02:39.260> if<00:02:39.709> we

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
now if we were in a La Nina state if we

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.589 
now if we were in a La Nina state if we
were<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.459> an<00:02:40.549> El<00:02:40.670> Nino<00:02:40.700> state<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.360> would<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
were in an El Nino state it would just

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.759 
were in an El Nino state it would just
be<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> opposite<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.290> would<00:02:42.409> have<00:02:42.530> low

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
be the opposite we would have low

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.830 
be the opposite we would have low
pressure<00:02:43.010> sitting<00:02:43.459> up<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> Gulf<00:02:44.090> Alaska

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
pressure sitting up in the Gulf Alaska

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.300 
pressure sitting up in the Gulf Alaska
and<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.200> would<00:02:45.319> be<00:02:45.410> bending<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.920> jet<00:02:46.160> stream

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
and it would be bending that jet stream

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.160 
and it would be bending that jet stream
a<00:02:46.489> lot<00:02:46.730> lower<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.540> guide<00:02:47.660> storms

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
a lot lower and that would guide storms

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.020 
a lot lower and that would guide storms
more<00:02:48.379> directly<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.950> our<00:02:48.980> area<00:02:49.430> but<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:49.940> right

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
more directly to our area but for right

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.150 
more directly to our area but for right
now<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.420> very<00:02:50.690> Lonnie<00:02:51.110> Nia<00:02:51.470> asked<00:02:51.560> although<00:02:52.040> we

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
now is very Lonnie Nia asked although we

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.069 
now is very Lonnie Nia asked although we
are<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.549> somewhat<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.970> neutral<00:02:53.150> state<00:02:53.599> so

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
are in somewhat of a neutral state so

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.720 
are in somewhat of a neutral state so
when<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.290> boils<00:02:54.440> down<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.400> are<00:02:55.549> in

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
when it boils down to it we are in

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.690 
when it boils down to it we are in
somewhat<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.329> normal<00:02:56.840> season<00:02:57.079> this<00:02:57.590> year<00:03:00.700> so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
somewhat of a normal season this year so

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.470 
somewhat of a normal season this year so
there<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.000> it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
there you have it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.360 
there you have it
we're<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.840> actually<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.379> neutral<00:03:03.890> state<00:03:04.129> this

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
we're in actually a neutral state this

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.369 
we're in actually a neutral state this
is<00:03:04.579> considered<00:03:05.000> would<00:03:05.090> be<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.299> normal<00:03:05.989> for<00:03:06.349> a

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
is considered would be a normal for a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.160 
is considered would be a normal for a
California<00:03:07.220> winter<00:03:07.489> we're<00:03:08.450> used<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.870> seeing<00:03:09.109> a

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
California winter we're used to seeing a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.720 
California winter we're used to seeing a

lot of big storms things are changing we
are<00:03:12.680> getting<00:03:12.980> into<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.489> end<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.879> January

toward the February time period we do

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.039 
toward the February time period we do
tend<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.760> see<00:03:16.819> bigger<00:03:17.150> swells<00:03:17.420> because<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
tend to see bigger swells because of the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.900 
tend to see bigger swells because of the
Jetstream<00:03:18.470> lowering<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.519> blocking

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
Jetstream lowering but that blocking

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.670 
Jetstream lowering but that blocking
high<00:03:20.090> pressure<00:03:20.450> well<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:21.049> also<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.470> keeps

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
high pressure well that's also it keeps

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.229 
high pressure well that's also it keeps
something<00:03:21.890> California<00:03:22.489> quite<00:03:22.670> warm<00:03:22.940> quite<00:03:23.209> a

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
something California quite warm quite a

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.569 
something California quite warm quite a
bit<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.440> more<00:03:24.590> indicative<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.220> La<00:03:25.370> Nina

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
bit it is more indicative in a La Nina

bit it is more indicative in a La Nina
season<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.450> anyways<00:03:27.290> either<00:03:27.620> case<00:03:27.920> when<00:03:28.370> I

season but anyways either case when I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.589 
season but anyways either case when I
mentioned<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.760> blocking<00:03:29.209> high<00:03:29.329> pressure

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
mentioned that blocking high pressure

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.150 
mentioned that blocking high pressure
system<00:03:30.049> that's<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.739> talking<00:03:31.099> about

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
system that's what I'm talking about

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.039 
system that's what I'm talking about
disturbing<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.940> jet<00:03:32.150> stream<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.900> course

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
disturbing the jet stream and of course

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.539 
disturbing the jet stream and of course
effect<00:03:33.319> cancer<00:03:33.590> for<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.859> California<00:03:34.340> coast

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
effect cancer for the California coast

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.220 
effect cancer for the California coast
