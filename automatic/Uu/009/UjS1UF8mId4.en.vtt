00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
just take off this pace and inside there

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.630 
just take off this pace and inside there
is<00:03:47.760> i<00:03:48.090> believe<00:03:48.209> just<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.230> red<00:03:49.770> steering<00:03:50.430> wheel

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
is i believe just a red steering wheel

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.090 
is i believe just a red steering wheel
and<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.270> brown<00:03:51.600> seat<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.200> nothing<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:52.680> too

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
and a brown seat so nothing really too

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
and a brown seat so nothing really too
fancy<00:03:53.640> inside<00:03:53.970> i<00:03:54.270> wish<00:03:54.750> they<00:03:54.959> could<00:03:55.110> have

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
fancy inside i wish they could have

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.010 
fancy inside i wish they could have
included<00:03:55.650> something<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.400> bit<00:03:56.640> better

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
included something a little bit better

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.050 
included something a little bit better
but<00:03:58.020> it's<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.739> all<00:03:58.950> right<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.459> i<00:03:59.700> figure

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
but it's it's all right and i figure

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
but it's it's all right and i figure
really<00:04:00.330> easily<00:04:00.870> sits<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.350> there<00:04:01.530> i<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
really easily sits in there i like the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
windmill on the turbine the city the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.500 
windmill on the turbine the city the
kingdom<00:05:17.380> said<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:18.460> can<00:05:18.580> pull<00:05:19.300> those<00:05:19.480> down

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
kingdom said and you can pull those down

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.290 
kingdom said and you can pull those down
and<00:05:19.960> basically<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:21.070> put<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.550> Triceratops

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300

and basically just put the Triceratops
into<00:05:23.140> here<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.690> he<00:05:25.690> fits<00:05:25.990> really<00:05:26.380> well<00:05:26.500> so

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
into here and he fits really well so

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.980 
into here and he fits really well so
that's<00:05:27.040> pretty<00:05:27.340> cool<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:28.660> can<00:05:28.840> actually

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
that's pretty cool and you can actually

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.560 
that's pretty cool and you can actually
fit<00:05:29.380> any<00:05:29.980> Dino<00:05:30.400> from<00:05:30.790> this<00:05:31.000> series<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.420> there

design<00:05:58.360> techniques<00:05:58.810> really<00:05:59.590> cool<00:05:59.830> ways<00:06:00.160> they

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
design techniques really cool ways they

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.920 
design techniques really cool ways they
use<00:06:00.670> some<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:01.000> these<00:06:01.090> pieces<00:06:01.390> some<00:06:01.720> really

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.840 
use some of these pieces some really
cool<00:06:02.080> big<00:06:02.320> pieces<00:06:02.590> that's<00:06:03.460> probably<00:06:03.610> why<00:06:03.760> this

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
cool big pieces that's probably why this

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.090 
cool big pieces that's probably why this
