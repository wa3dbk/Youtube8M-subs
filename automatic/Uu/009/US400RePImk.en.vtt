we<00:02:56.480> played<00:02:56.510> our<00:02:56.930> best<00:02:56.960> game<00:02:57.380> either<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.770> thought

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
we played our best game either I thought

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.480 
we played our best game either I thought
we<00:02:58.280> had<00:02:58.760> players<00:02:59.360> who<00:02:59.680> didn't<00:03:00.680> play<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:01.340> well

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
we had players who didn't play as well

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.790 
we had players who didn't play as well
as<00:03:01.550> they<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:02.050> we<00:03:03.050> didn't<00:03:03.260> execute<00:03:03.350> some

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
as they can we didn't execute some

as they can we didn't execute some
things<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.310> thought<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.180> played<00:03:05.330> very

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
things that we thought we played very

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.180

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
all the time and then tonight we had

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.550 
all the time and then tonight we had
that<00:03:11.420> we<00:03:11.480> didn't<00:03:11.660> execute<00:03:11.780> or<00:03:12.230> they<00:03:12.320> did<00:03:12.440> they

that we didn't execute or they did they
made<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.740> little<00:03:12.920> bit<00:03:13.010> more<00:03:13.130> difficult<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:13.640> us

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
made a little bit more difficult for us

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.330 
made a little bit more difficult for us
to<00:03:13.850> get<00:03:14.060> pucks<00:03:14.240> another<00:03:14.600> zone<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.920> way<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
to get pucks another zone the way that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.970 
to get pucks another zone the way that
this<00:03:16.580> series<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.270> going<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.510> be<00:03:17.600> played<00:03:17.980> that's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
this series is going to be played that's

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.380 
this series is going to be played that's
the<00:03:19.660> last<00:03:20.660> night<00:03:20.959> eh<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.470> thought<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.370> thought<00:03:23.000> we

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the last night eh I thought I thought we

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.430 
the last night eh I thought I thought we
played<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:25.280> loose<00:03:25.720> with<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.900> puck<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.350> I

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
played really loose with the puck and I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.140 
played really loose with the puck and I
thought<00:03:27.620> today<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.130> were<00:03:28.250> slot<00:03:28.550> smarter<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.120> I

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
thought today we were slot smarter and I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.600 
thought today we were slot smarter and I
think<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.360> was<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.600> big<00:03:29.810> difference<00:03:30.200> we<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:31.489> know

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
think I was a big difference we you know

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.310 
think I was a big difference we you know
we<00:03:31.820> put<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.120> puck<00:03:32.300> in<00:03:32.330> areas<00:03:32.780> where<00:03:32.959> we<00:03:33.140> could

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
we put the puck in areas where we could

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.980 
we put the puck in areas where we could
put<00:03:33.470> more<00:03:33.709> pressure<00:03:33.890> on<00:03:34.160> them<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
put more pressure on them and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.080 
put more pressure on them and
last<00:03:35.680> night<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.070> just<00:03:36.100> turned<00:03:36.460> so<00:03:36.640> many<00:03:36.820> parks

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
last night we just turned so many parks

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.400 
last night we just turned so many parks
over<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.360> think<00:03:37.600> we<00:03:37.690> wore<00:03:37.870> ourselves<00:03:38.020> up

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
over I think we wore ourselves up

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.380 
over I think we wore ourselves up
chasing<00:03:38.680> back<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.280> our<00:03:39.430> end<00:03:39.640> tonight<00:03:40.060> we're

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
chasing back in our end tonight we're

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.150 
chasing back in our end tonight we're
smarter<00:03:40.810> outs<00:03:41.200> are<00:03:41.410> saying<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.770> think<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.040> had

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
smarter outs are saying I think we had

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.410 
smarter outs are saying I think we had
more<00:03:42.280> energy<00:03:42.460> because<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:43.030> didn't<00:03:43.240> waste

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
more energy because we didn't waste

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.900 
more energy because we didn't waste
ourselves<00:03:44.170> having<00:03:44.710> to<00:03:44.920> backcheck<00:03:45.100> as<00:03:45.520> much<00:03:45.730> as

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
ourselves having to backcheck as much as

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.330 
ourselves having to backcheck as much as
we<00:03:46.030> did<00:03:46.150> last<00:03:46.210> night<00:03:46.600> jason<00:03:47.170> beck<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.070> RN

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
we did last night jason beck and RN

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.490 
we did last night jason beck and RN
because<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.700> turnovers<00:03:49.180> tonight<00:03:49.390> we<00:03:49.750> kept

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
because the turnovers tonight we kept

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.040 
because the turnovers tonight we kept
advancing<00:03:50.800> things<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.700> tried<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.690> keep<00:03:52.810> more

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
advancing things and tried to keep more

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.780 
advancing things and tried to keep more
pressure<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.440> them<00:03:53.770> and<00:03:54.010> anytime<00:03:54.460> you're

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
pressure on them and anytime you're

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.850 
pressure on them and anytime you're
smart<00:03:55.120> against<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.540> with<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.410> puck<00:03:56.590> against

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
smart against it with the puck against

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.680 
smart against it with the puck against
the<00:03:56.980> checking<00:03:57.370> team<00:03:57.580> you're<00:03:57.790> not<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.630> to
