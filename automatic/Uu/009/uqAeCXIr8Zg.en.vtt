00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.930 
notice how they play through it once and
then<00:01:02.440> he<00:01:02.530> comes<00:01:02.740> back<00:01:02.830> to<00:01:02.980> G<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.460> he<00:01:03.520> hangs<00:01:03.730> out

on<00:01:03.970> G<00:01:04.270> for<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.540> little<00:01:04.750> bit<00:01:04.840> okay<00:01:05.110> that's<00:01:06.070> kind

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
on G for a little bit okay that's kind

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.770 
on G for a little bit okay that's kind
of<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> intro<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.210> intro<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.600> played

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
of like the intro the intro is played

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.930 
of like the intro the intro is played
once<00:01:08.020> through<00:01:08.500> that<00:01:08.620> progression<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:09.340> then

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
once through that progression and then

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.250 
once through that progression and then
you<00:01:10.030> play<00:01:10.180> G<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.450> believe<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:10.870> I<00:01:11.020> think<00:01:11.170> it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
you play G I believe it I think it's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.120 
you play G I believe it I think it's
like<00:01:11.380> four<00:01:11.650> times

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
like four times

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.680 
like four times
um<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.890> once<00:01:14.890> he<00:01:15.730> plays<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.090> four<00:01:16.300> times<00:01:16.450> he

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
um so once he plays that four times he

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.030 
um so once he plays that four times he
goes<00:01:16.810> into<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> song<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:17.740> just<00:01:17.920> that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
goes into the song and it's just that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.950 
goes into the song and it's just that
progression<00:01:18.640> over<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.450> over<00:01:19.600> again<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:19.900> you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
progression over and over again so you

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.760 
progression over and over again so you

on down however all I'm doing is I'm
just<00:02:34.990> not<00:02:35.320> muting<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.040> gets<00:02:36.190> even<00:02:36.400> easier

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
just not muting so it gets even easier

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.220 
just not muting so it gets even easier
you<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:36.820> play<00:02:37.240> all<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> way<00:02:37.540> through<00:02:37.750> it
