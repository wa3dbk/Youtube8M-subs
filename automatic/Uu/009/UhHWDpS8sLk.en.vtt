screw will work but it has to be at
least<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.270> number<00:00:18.539> 10<00:00:18.859> if<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:20.340> doing<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
least the number 10 if you're doing a

small little two-foot wall you could

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
small little two-foot wall you could
probably<00:00:22.109> get<00:00:22.350> by<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.650> drywall<00:00:22.830> screws<00:00:23.220> but

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
probably get by with drywall screws but

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
probably get by with drywall screws but
we<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.640> recommend<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.119> recommend<00:00:24.810> using

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
we don't recommend it recommend using

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.990 
we don't recommend it recommend using
something<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> little<00:00:25.590> heavier<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.789> reason

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
something a little heavier the reason

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.490 
something a little heavier the reason
why<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.420> important<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
why that's so important is this is the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.560 
why that's so important is this is the
key<00:00:28.710> ingredient<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> hold<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> panels<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
key ingredient to hold the panels to the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.139 
key ingredient to hold the panels to the
plastic<00:00:31.170> we've<00:00:31.800> created<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.399> fantastic

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
plastic we've created a fantastic

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.600 
plastic we've created a fantastic
surface<00:00:33.719> for<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> screw<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> tie<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.800> but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
surface for the screw to tie into but

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
surface for the screw to tie into but
without<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> proper<00:00:36.270> screws<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.899> won't<00:00:37.079> have

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
without the proper screws you won't have

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200 
without the proper screws you won't have
the<00:00:37.530> max<00:00:37.770> amount<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.160> strength<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.460> gives

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the max amount of strength that gives

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
the max amount of strength that gives
you<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> best<00:00:39.570> results<00:00:40.079> another<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.190> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you the best results another thing we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.619 
you the best results another thing we
like<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> spend<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> moment<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> type<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
like to spend a moment on it's a type of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.180 
like to spend a moment on it's a type of
drill<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.649> pretty<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:43.890> use<00:00:44.010> any

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
drill you can pretty much use any

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
drill you can pretty much use any
cordless<00:00:44.760> drill<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> Linpack

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
cordless drill but these are the Linpack

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.200 
cordless drill but these are the Linpack
drill<00:00:46.500> seem<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.950> work<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> best<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
drill seem to work the best and the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
drill seem to work the best and the
reason<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.200> once<00:00:49.860> you've<00:00:50.070> driven

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
reason for that is once you've driven

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
reason for that is once you've driven
the<00:00:50.820> screws<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> plywood<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:51.930> soon<00:00:52.050> as

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the screws to the plywood and as soon as

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
the screws to the plywood and as soon as
it<00:00:52.260> makes<00:00:52.410> contact<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> plastic<00:00:53.579> tie

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it makes contact with the plastic tie

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.240 
it makes contact with the plastic tie
behind<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.870> tends<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> push<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> plastic<00:00:56.070> tie

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
behind it tends to push the plastic tie

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
behind it tends to push the plastic tie
away<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> tool<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.840> talk<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
away now the tool will talk about that

inside the wall where you can't see you
don't<00:03:02.110> even<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.410> worry<00:03:02.590> about<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:04.260> okay

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
don't even have to worry about it okay

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:17.750 
don't even have to worry about it okay
we're<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.470> demonstrate<00:03:05.590> how<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.100> works

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.070 

now<00:03:18.760> you've<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.270> you've<00:03:19.390> got<00:03:19.570> an<00:03:19.690> uneven

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
now you've got if you've got an uneven

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.630 
now you've got if you've got an uneven
gap<00:03:20.260> here<00:03:20.500> let's<00:03:20.680> say<00:03:20.770> for<00:03:20.920> example<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.460> gap

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
gap here let's say for example the gap

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.310 
gap here let's say for example the gap
is<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.120> then<00:03:22.420> your<00:03:22.600> whole<00:03:22.840> stack<00:03:23.140> is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
is like this then your whole stack is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.830 
is like this then your whole stack is
not<00:03:23.470> square<00:03:23.830> inside<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.790> tap<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.720> way<00:03:25.810> or

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
not square inside so tap it one way or

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.540 
not square inside so tap it one way or
the<00:03:25.900> other<00:03:25.990> one<00:03:26.650> way<00:03:26.770> or<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:26.920> other<00:03:27.010> until

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
the other one way or the other until

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.190 
the other one way or the other until
this<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.910> nice<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.240> tight<00:03:28.420> now<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:29.050> your

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
this is nice and tight now you know your

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.680 
this is nice and tight now you know your
square<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.710> top<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.010> your<00:03:30.070> plywood

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
square with the top of your plywood

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.600 
square with the top of your plywood
starting<00:03:31.690> at<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.810> top<00:03:31.900> hole<00:03:32.430> take<00:03:33.430> these

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
starting at the top hole take these

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.480 
starting at the top hole take these
screws<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:33.970> we<00:03:34.060> talked<00:03:34.300> about<00:03:35.220> place<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.370> in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
screws that we talked about place it in

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.480 
screws that we talked about place it in
the<00:03:36.580> center<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> hole<00:03:38.370> sometimes<00:03:39.370> it

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
the center of the hole sometimes it

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.680 
the center of the hole sometimes it
helps<00:03:39.580> just<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.850> grab<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.180> tie<00:03:40.300> from<00:03:40.510> behind

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
helps just to grab the tie from behind

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.970 
helps just to grab the tie from behind
on<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.990> starting<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:44.230> suck<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.710> screw

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
on the starting and suck up that screw

till it starts to semi countersink once
it's<00:03:47.230> done<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.740> know<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.250> fact<00:03:48.400> that

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
it's done that you know for a fact that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.980 
it's done that you know for a fact that
the<00:03:48.700> plastic<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.180> tied<00:03:49.360> against<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.690> plywood

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
the plastic is tied against the plywood

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.780 
the plastic is tied against the plywood
on<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.170> inside<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> repeat<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.550> all<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
on the inside and repeat that all the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:11.730 
on the inside and repeat that all the
way<00:03:51.880> down<00:03:52.060> now<00:04:09.540> you'll<00:04:10.540> notice<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.110> in<00:04:11.380> your

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
way down now you'll notice that in your

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.620 
way down now you'll notice that in your
starter<00:04:12.100> tie<00:04:12.250> there's<00:04:12.490> a<00:04:12.520> little<00:04:12.640> slot<00:04:12.850> the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
starter tie there's a little slot the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.030 
starter tie there's a little slot the
purpose<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:13.990> that<00:04:14.110> slot<00:04:14.350> is<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.620> put<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> screw

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
purpose of that slot is to put a screw

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.420 
purpose of that slot is to put a screw
there<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.290> on<00:04:17.290> shorter<00:04:17.620> walls<00:04:17.799> probably<00:04:18.310> not

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
there so on shorter walls probably not

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.890 
there so on shorter walls probably not
necessary<00:04:18.549> but<00:04:18.880> your<00:04:19.090> start<00:04:19.239> getting<00:04:19.420> into

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
necessary but your start getting into

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.599 
necessary but your start getting into
wall<00:04:20.020> is<00:04:20.140> four<00:04:20.380> or<00:04:20.500> five<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.709> six<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.220> 10<00:04:21.430> foot

wall is four or five and six and 10 foot

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.920 
wall is four or five and six and 10 foot
high<00:04:21.640> then<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.150> definitely<00:04:22.450> want<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.780> put<00:04:22.900> a

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
high then you definitely want to put a

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.450 
high then you definitely want to put a
screw<00:04:23.170> there<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.980> aim<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.160> for<00:04:26.370> once<00:04:27.370> you're

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
screw there just aim it for once you're

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.780 
screw there just aim it for once you're
done<00:04:28.080> simply<00:04:29.080> pull<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.670> alignment<00:04:30.670> tool

right<00:04:30.940> up<00:04:31.090> let's<00:04:31.510> talk<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.720> little<00:04:31.900> bit<00:04:32.050> about

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
right up let's talk a little bit about

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.500 
right up let's talk a little bit about
plywood<00:04:32.680> what<00:04:33.280> we<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.520> here<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:34.090> half<00:04:34.300> inch

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
plywood what we have here is half inch

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.920 
plywood what we have here is half inch
HD<00:04:35.080> oh<00:04:35.110> it's<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.160> high-density<00:04:36.520> ply<00:04:37.000> made<00:04:37.390> extra

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
HD oh it's a high-density ply made extra

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.440 
HD oh it's a high-density ply made extra
specially<00:04:38.620> for<00:04:38.860> concrete<00:04:39.370> forms<00:04:39.670> this

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
specially for concrete forms this

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.720 
specially for concrete forms this
happens<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.110> use<00:04:41.380> sheet<00:04:41.650> if<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.550> take

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
happens to be a use sheet if you take

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.100 
happens to be a use sheet if you take
good<00:04:42.910> care<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.150> your<00:04:43.360> plywood<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:44.020> get

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
good care of your plywood you can get

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.230 
good care of your plywood you can get
many<00:04:44.290> uses<00:04:44.530> out<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.640> sheet<00:04:45.880> here<00:04:46.150> we

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
many uses out of it this sheet here we

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.530 
many uses out of it this sheet here we
probably<00:04:46.510> get<00:04:46.780> 15<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.470> 20<00:04:47.830> maybe<00:04:48.100> 30<00:04:48.370> pours<00:04:48.760> if

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
probably get 15 to 20 maybe 30 pours if

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.880 
probably get 15 to 20 maybe 30 pours if
you<00:04:49.630> take<00:04:49.780> real<00:04:49.960> good<00:04:49.990> care<00:04:50.140> of<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.410> this<00:04:50.710> is<00:04:50.860> a

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
you take real good care of it this is a

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.250 
you take real good care of it this is a
brand<00:04:51.100> new<00:04:51.160> sheet<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:51.670> never<00:04:51.850> been<00:04:52.030> used

brand new sheet that's never been used

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.870 
brand new sheet that's never been used
the<00:04:53.260> reason<00:04:53.530> why<00:04:53.650> we<00:04:53.830> like<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.100> use<00:04:54.190> h<00:04:54.400> do<00:04:54.640> is

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
the reason why we like to use h do is

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.980 
the reason why we like to use h do is
because<00:04:55.030> we<00:04:55.180> like<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.420> be<00:04:55.480> able<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.690> pour<00:04:55.870> our

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
because we like to be able to pour our

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.390 
because we like to be able to pour our
forms<00:04:56.320> all<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> way<00:04:56.650> up<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.860> top<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.280> can

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
forms all the way up to the top you can

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.100 
forms all the way up to the top you can
pour<00:04:57.610> four<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:57.940> five<00:04:58.150> foot<00:04:58.419> in<00:04:58.630> one<00:04:58.810> shot

pour four to five foot in one shot

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.440 
pour four to five foot in one shot
without<00:04:59.320> any<00:04:59.620> worries<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.220> blowout<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:00.580> we

without any worries of a blowout but we

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.420 
without any worries of a blowout but we

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
two two and a half feet you let it set

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.570 
two two and a half feet you let it set
up<00:05:12.940> long<00:05:13.300> enough<00:05:13.480> so<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.020> Hydra

mentioned our joint is not landing on a
spider<00:05:35.469> tie<00:05:35.679> stack<00:05:35.979> so<00:05:36.249> we<00:05:36.669> took<00:05:36.879> us<00:05:37.059> a<00:05:37.269> scab

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
spider tie stack so we took us a scab

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.199 
spider tie stack so we took us a scab
piece<00:05:37.989> like<00:05:38.529> this<00:05:38.739> and<00:05:39.009> every<00:05:39.609> six<00:05:39.819> inches<00:05:40.059> or

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:40.209 
piece like this and every six inches or
