 and why today in the world of sports are this investor 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.700
 to prepare such a head 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.910
 big goals 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.590
 we are used to sands has spent two environments in sports practices 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.449
 Although the sport is prepared 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.860
 a lot in the physical 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 much the technician a lot in strategic

 the envoys of what is essential that all of that will go well 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.469
 all that will have 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.120

 and the head rises on a good day 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 because if they decide public, I talk about this because if I had only prepared 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.630
 for example to run a marathon 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 is 5 times the interest of every day 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 making long funds making many passes and the day of the marathon 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.140
 Colon Theater 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.829
 a fear is immense 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.100
 updated with 10 kilometers 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 with a lot of pressure 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 with much 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.790
 percent existence 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.079
 com with a lot there is a lot of anxiety 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.070
 surely I will not be able to achieve the reforms 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.250
 criticized that there are 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.390
 has happened to us 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 very many cases 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 find athlete who are preparing to achieve 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.929
 so longed for career 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.510
 and good days before he gets injured 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.649
 and were injured from injuries that had goals in which 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.549
 they really were not planned 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.719
 and then they prepare for the race it seems foolish 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.650
 and all this is realizing 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.020
 that zaba shobaki company head in the body 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.560
 all conflicts photo 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.549
 these fears 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.269
 what is going to make the athlete can not also compete 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.649
 head 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.019
 It's fundamental 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.040
 and I say it because I work psychology but because through it 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.190
 to lie 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.479
 the experience that he is living is happening to the athlete 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 I ignore that the athlete here 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.790
 as we say and he cares about running with 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.580
 with mental clarity and mental and mental strength to overcome 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.389
 obstacles 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.849
 is the one that will achieve 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.669
 the objectives is to value enjoy 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.500
 i 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.829
 and is that according to the law 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.939
 we understand that the athlete is prepared to run and shout trained and 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.999
 mentally prepared 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.949
 work to do 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.320
 in a time 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.620
 p the important thing was to lower their consumption scare low the time is to lower 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.530
 in the middle of the money 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.450
 what happens 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.359
 with those athletes that run will kill me 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.789
 who prepares to run a marathon his burial will be prepared 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.819
 racquet towards his first marathon and not the last 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.819
 because because the effort is not so important 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.639
 we run with so much suffering 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.510
 that when wolf the sale 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.689
 I promise not to charge it again and that for me 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.730
 esulta before and lose the battle 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.790
 because because the wolf chooses this discipline as 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.519
 Mirkin and 55 to football that runs 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.209
 any report for what to enjoy 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.400
 to have a good time 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.169
 and to 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.620
 vote for yourself 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.659
 quilpuÃ© and that can achieve challenges 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.299
 as important as in all the time 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.739
 things well that we are enough for us and for the deputies 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.089
 we do not work on four pillars 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.539
 what is the motivation that if you want to want 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.690
 do something 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.599
 the ong 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.039
 the desire to grow something that is the push 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.239
 it's funny for me 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.729
 I agreed to collect 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.659
 concentration 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.889
 focus mentally 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.340
 all energy 'in critical danger' 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.059
 imagine what 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.379
 to hit 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.550
 corral 22 kilometers of city around three and a half hours or more 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.860
 less 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 and there are three ideas where one is constantly thinking 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.379
 In the goal 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.229
 and not just the sale if you do not think about the body think what you want to think about 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.509
 a lot of things 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.819
 they say that ccoo 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.770
 and if one 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.270
 by the way the concentration oo is carried away by a lot of executions that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.629
 lead the longtime athlete 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:00.440
 sometimes 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.229
 so it can hurt him to accelerate the pace to lose a lot of 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.130
 since 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.400
 min energy 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.120
 ar the divine button that not that after the deserved at the end 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.280
 after which are the fish controls and videos 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.280
 a very important issue when something of fear 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.190
 the athletic masella when they run their first marathon 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.220
 want the great fear of AIDS 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.730
 it's more they feel 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.180
 sometimes kino valencia 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.469
 this belief 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.759
 so I would like 1 very big pablo great athlete 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.349
 and so many times 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.990
 Its determinant 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.479
 in the race 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.430
 qatar against the pressures that one or the self-demand that is not going to be generated 2 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.270
 and control the flight the fears that one has through him 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.629
 they ask for the passage of time it will allow me 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.159
 want 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.620
 believe that I have done 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.689

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.499

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:20.389
 and pride 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.259
 that after having entered both and after having overcome each 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.330
 situation is complicated so many conflicting situations 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.330
 and there may be 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.250
 trained in situations 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.169
 many times adverse 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.820
 have the area removed lara has valued the goal 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.620
