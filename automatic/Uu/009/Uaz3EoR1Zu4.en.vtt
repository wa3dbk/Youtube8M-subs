00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
whoever interacts with the horses that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.720

they<00:01:01.260> bring<00:01:01.559> life<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> horse<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.579> as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
they bring life to the horse as much as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
they bring life to the horse as much as
the<00:01:02.820> puppeteers<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.439> build<00:01:04.680> up

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the puppeteers do so they build up

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
the puppeteers do so they build up
strength<00:01:05.070> over<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> puppeteers

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
strength over that time the puppeteers

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
strength over that time the puppeteers
because<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.020> physics<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> must<00:01:07.830> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
because it's very physics it must be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.480 
because it's very physics it must be
ripped<00:01:08.130> yeah<00:01:08.520> yeah<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.600> we've<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.500> practical

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
ripped yeah yeah and we've got practical

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
ripped yeah yeah and we've got practical
and<00:01:11.790> emotional<00:01:12.000> indicators<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> horse

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and emotional indicators for the horse

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.350 
and emotional indicators for the horse
so<00:01:13.409> we've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> head<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.610> heart<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

so we've got the head the heart and the
hind<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.400> practical<00:01:17.820> responsibility

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
hind and so the practical responsibility

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
hind and so the practical responsibility
for<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> head<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> eyeline<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
for the head is eyeline and the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
for the head is eyeline and the
emotional<00:01:20.729> indicator<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> ears<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.990> can
