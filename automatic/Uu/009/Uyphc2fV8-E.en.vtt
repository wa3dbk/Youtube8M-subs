nope not quite there is hey I'm so glad
I<00:04:45.510> am<00:04:45.750> where<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.960> think<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:48.590> because<00:04:49.590> if<00:04:49.770> I'm

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
I am where I think it's because if I'm

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.440 
I am where I think it's because if I'm
not<00:04:50.099> wearing<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.669> this<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> big<00:04:51.210> problem

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
not wearing and this is a big problem

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.140 
not wearing and this is a big problem
that<00:04:51.919> that's<00:04:52.919> what<00:04:53.190> that's<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.580> difficulty

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
that that's what that's the difficulty

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.270 
that that's what that's the difficulty
of<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.270> level<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:54.930> guess<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.410> figured<00:04:55.650> out<00:04:56.070> why

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
of that level I guess I figured out why

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.150 
of that level I guess I figured out why
it's<00:04:56.490> difficult<00:04:56.990> because<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.229> can't<00:04:58.860> see

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
it's difficult because you can't see

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.940 
it's difficult because you can't see
where<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.580> are<00:04:59.789> until<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:01.169> at<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.770> end

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
where you are until it's at the end

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.940 
where you are until it's at the end
pretty<00:05:02.280> much<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:03.169> will<00:05:04.169> say<00:05:04.380> this<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.680> computer

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
pretty much I will say this the computer

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.589 
pretty much I will say this the computer
