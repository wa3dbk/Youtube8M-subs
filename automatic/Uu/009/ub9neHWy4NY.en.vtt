00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I had one strand one strand that didn't

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
I had one strand one strand that didn't
work<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:33.870> gonna<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> later<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
work and I'm gonna show you later how I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.600 
work and I'm gonna show you later how I
brought<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> back<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> life

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
brought it back to life

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110 
brought it back to life
so<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.300> cost<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.840> $5.99<00:00:37.829> per<00:00:38.340> section<00:00:38.969> as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so they cost about $5.99 per section as

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
so they cost about $5.99 per section as
opposed<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> $2.99<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.829> even<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.190> these

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
opposed to $2.99 they even have these

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
opposed to $2.99 they even have these
battery<00:00:41.760> operated<00:00:42.210> ones<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:42.960> are

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
battery operated ones which I think are

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
battery operated ones which I think are
awesome<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.340> like
