00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.610
 hello and welcome to the gsm to do it today i want to talk to you about 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.920
 it sucks me wells because I was asked several questions at the level of two 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.500
 pc writing but this to change keyboard change keyboard type 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 to add actions and other features 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.659
 sms or machined 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.169
 so it's very simple we're already going, so it's justifiable 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.759
 while doing drafting and samassa message 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.470
 and so here we are on the phone keypad part then 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.860
 it's very simple so we need to be able to change in e the keyboard that just 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.429
 thanks to this function in the little theater that allow the team fr 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.610
 we press on it we stay in why 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.180
 here we are with two solutions the intuitive writing the t9 we can 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.770
 enable or disable 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.900
 for me to do that you are general but if I do not like it 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.840
 do not hesitate his activism the point with the eu seeing green for them 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.690
 assets one can also change the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.420
 input mode as the keyboard so the share of the excavations in the azerty keyboard 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.109
 but if I want to have a classic phone keypad we 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.220
 let's put a keyboard so the azerty keyboard 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.170
 the full screen writing or the input box so i'll show you so 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 first the keyboard I will apply here we are again on a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 classic phone keyboard so three letters per key 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.740
 to you then to make your messages 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 it does not interest me I will go further I call again so on my 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.229
 little planet so I'm going to come here I create azerty keyboard 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.090
 I apply that we do not forget to apply death here with my 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.770
 keyboard so I do not have intuitive writing so I tap directly on 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.510
 what my keyboard the words the Indians and the others 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.730
 precisely the goal is not to exclude while growing% it will have to 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.290
 maybe I'm adding moment put together to do this is very 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.270
 simple one presses the letter can add an accent go for example 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.730
 people we will rely on and see the letter appears so we will put 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.460
 an accent on the shot the country in the same way we do not see the chargers 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.400
 the leader with my accent 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.520
 then I have handwriting so we find my keyboard cathy planet 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 full screen writing here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.049
 jacky still not even me 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.960
 here I am with a keyboard for a hundred times more than life at all 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.909
 so here I wrote directly on the screen so I do not know if it comes back 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 I will write 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 hi s 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 you can write with a stylus me I wear them 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.509
 uma thurman 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.479
 and tea 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.699
 so I wrote in cocoa greet it's not very obvious because I 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.389
 not very good 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.139
 so to fly all written directly on the screen and finally 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.699
 internet it is always in support on the headrest with the fn 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.149
 penetrating and the peaceful zone so we apply the input area by reminding 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.959
 the palms e or can same area besides scares us a symbol of which you 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.429
 see he tells us how to make the symbol returned so can not she 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:49.640
 titled a small place 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.209
 as well as back 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.689
 so if we want to clearly redo the entry precisely tact inc 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.090
 to close the fact of menzah 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.209
 we do everything we want directly from this keyboard after saint-tite 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.180
 learning with replacing what space is accelerating on the side we're going 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.409
 go back 5th in France 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.370
 aof collects its data from the sources that it prepared to know it I 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.040
 passed in his hands it's a writing not leave the same for those 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.800
 who know 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.540
 I go back to my classic keyboard in the input area I prefer 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.059
 the azerty keyboard 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.559
 I also prefer intuitive writing 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.010
 I want to do and here we are with us 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.129
 my classic keyboard with the words that appear directly I can do 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.770
 scroll if jamel I do not have the word I want 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.240
 and I can even add 1 to add to my taste to do this 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.629
 I spent everything I did on our hunger 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.069
