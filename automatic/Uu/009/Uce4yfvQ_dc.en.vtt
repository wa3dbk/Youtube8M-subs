00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
hello can you band-aid proves it right

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600 
hello can you band-aid proves it right
there<00:00:30.769> when<00:00:31.769> you're<00:00:31.890> doing<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.399> want<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
there when you're doing this you want to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.819 
there when you're doing this you want to
go<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> edge<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.600> close<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.020> possible<00:00:34.079> of

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
go to the edge as close as possible of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.360 
go to the edge as close as possible of
the<00:00:35.250> actual<00:00:35.730> stamp<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.329> order<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> off

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
the actual stamp in order to get it off

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
the actual stamp in order to get it off
so<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.969> even<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.450> possible<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
so that it's as even as possible in the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
so that it's as even as possible in the
backside<00:00:40.649> even<00:00:41.250> though<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.210> some

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
backside even though I did get some

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.420 
backside even though I did get some
uneven<00:00:42.870> stamps<00:00:43.290> during<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.680> process<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
uneven stamps during this process and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
uneven stamps during this process and
they<00:00:44.489> still<00:00:44.760> seem<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> stamp<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.600> fine

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
they still seem to stamp just fine

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
they still seem to stamp just fine
so<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.940> worry<00:00:48.120> too<00:00:48.450> much<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so don't worry too much about that and I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
so don't worry too much about that and I
know<00:00:49.590> some<00:00:49.950> people<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:51.120> heated<00:00:51.600> their

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
know some people have heated their

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
know some people have heated their
stamps<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.320> order<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.770> remove<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
stamps in order to remove them from the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
stamps in order to remove them from the
block<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.360> tried<00:00:54.750> heating<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> wasn't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
block I tried heating it and it wasn't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
block I tried heating it and it wasn't
working<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.309> great<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.360> don't

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
working that great with these I don't

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
working that great with these I don't
know<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.020> maybe<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:59.100> they're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
know if maybe it's just because they're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
know if maybe it's just because they're
the<00:00:59.309> dollar<00:00:59.520> bin<00:00:59.789> stamps<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the dollar bin stamps but for me it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049 
the dollar bin stamps but for me it
didn't<00:01:01.260> work<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.649> great<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.370> again<00:01:02.850> be

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
didn't work all that great and again be

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
didn't work all that great and again be
careful<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.510> pulling<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
careful when pulling it off and if you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
careful when pulling it off and if you
can<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> off<00:01:05.460> after<00:01:06.090> you've<00:01:06.299> kind<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can get it off after you've kind of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
can get it off after you've kind of
maneuvered<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> blade<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
maneuvered the blade in the back of it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
maneuvered the blade in the back of it
you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.580> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> simply<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.210> pull<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you can kind of simply just pull off the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
you can kind of simply just pull off the
rest<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.100> stamps<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.000> off

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
rest of it some stamps will come off

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
rest of it some stamps will come off
easier<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.630> others<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
easier than others and you can see it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.420 
easier than others and you can see it
has<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> slight<00:01:14.880> unevenness<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.080> still

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
has a slight unevenness and it's still

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.780 
has a slight unevenness and it's still
it's<00:01:17.430> still<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.939> fine<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.369> put

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it's still just fine so now you just put

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's still just fine so now you just put
that<00:01:20.820> wood<00:01:21.030> block<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> side<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.229> then

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that wood block to the side and then

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.539 
that wood block to the side and then
you're<00:01:22.500> gonna<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:22.920> glue<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> you're

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you're gonna get your glue and you're

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.539 
you're gonna get your glue and you're
gonna<00:01:23.700> want<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:25.470> enough<00:01:26.189> glue

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gonna want to do just like enough glue

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
gonna want to do just like enough glue
to<00:01:26.880> cover<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.540> area<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:29.159> glue<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
to cover the area but don't over glue it

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.480 
to cover the area but don't over glue it
because<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:30.299> need<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:31.490> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
because you don't need very much you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.300 
because you don't need very much you
need<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> very<00:01:33.000> thin<00:01:33.630> layer<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.409> worst-case

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
need a very thin layer and worst-case

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.679 
need a very thin layer and worst-case
scenario<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.939> didn't<00:01:36.180> feel<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.509> was

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
scenario if you didn't feel like it was

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.149 
scenario if you didn't feel like it was
sticky<00:01:37.140> enough<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.619> always<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
sticky enough you can always go back and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
sticky enough you can always go back and
add<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.329> better<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> thinner

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
add some more but better do a thinner

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.880 
add some more but better do a thinner
layer<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.439> doesn't<00:01:43.439> take<00:01:43.560> too<00:01:43.740> long

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
layer so that it doesn't take too long

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.359 
layer so that it doesn't take too long
to<00:01:43.950> dry<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> same<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.470> tacky

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to dry but at the same time it's tacky

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
to dry but at the same time it's tacky
enough<00:01:47.820> where<00:01:48.509> you're<00:01:48.720> gonna<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.259> cold

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
enough where you're gonna get that cold

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
enough where you're gonna get that cold
that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.970> would<00:01:51.479> say<00:01:51.720> about

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that you need so I would say about

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.960 
that you need so I would say about
depending<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> size<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.549> stamp<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
depending on the size of your stamp of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
depending on the size of your stamp of
course<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.479> maybe<00:01:54.600> first<00:01:55.049> stamp<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
course or maybe first stamp like this a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.120 
course or maybe first stamp like this a
dime<00:01:56.670> size<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.689> possibly<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.350> quarter<00:01:58.680> size<00:01:58.890> but

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
dime size to possibly a quarter size but

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.730 
dime size to possibly a quarter size but
more<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> dime<00:01:59.700> size<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.210> say<00:02:00.479> because

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
more of a dime size I would say because

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
more of a dime size I would say because
the<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.009> use<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.460> longer<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:02.939> gonna

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the more you use the longer it's gonna

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
the more you use the longer it's gonna
take<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.540> dry<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.290> after<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.860> your

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
take to dry and then after you have your

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.560 
take to dry and then after you have your
stamp<00:02:05.430> fully<00:02:05.670> coated<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.390> gonna

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
stamp fully coated you're just gonna

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.960 
stamp fully coated you're just gonna
want<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.860> side<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> allow<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
want to put it to the side and allow it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.960 
want to put it to the side and allow it
to<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> proper<00:02:10.080> drying<00:02:10.379> time<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to have proper drying time and it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.230 
to have proper drying time and it's
shakier<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
shakier that

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.550 
shakier that
how<00:02:13.300> you're<00:02:13.480> gonna<00:02:13.600> know<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.320> dry

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
how you're gonna know when it's dry

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.230 
how you're gonna know when it's dry
these<00:02:14.950> are<00:02:15.130> stamps<00:02:15.310> I've<00:02:15.550> already<00:02:15.940> done

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
these are stamps I've already done

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.910 
these are stamps I've already done
before<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.410> I'm<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.680> showing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
before that one that I'm just showing

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.860 
before that one that I'm just showing
you<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:18.580> how<00:02:18.850> well<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.300> works<00:02:19.330> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
you so you can see how well it works so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.800 
you so you can see how well it works so
far<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:21.370> pulling<00:02:21.790> them<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.150> off<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.570> case

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
far I'm pulling them right off the case

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
far I'm pulling them right off the case
and<00:02:22.840> they<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.290> come<00:02:23.740> right<00:02:23.920> off<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.190> go<00:02:24.550> right

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and they can come right off and go right

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.000 
and they can come right off and go right
back<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:25.090> without<00:02:25.390> leaving<00:02:25.660> any<00:02:26.020> residue<00:02:26.380> on

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
back on without leaving any residue on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.210 
back on without leaving any residue on
the<00:02:27.520> actual<00:02:27.880> clear<00:02:28.350> case<00:02:29.350> itself<00:02:29.770> which<00:02:30.070> is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the actual clear case itself which is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.060 
the actual clear case itself which is
great<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:31.900> stick<00:02:32.170> right<00:02:32.380> back<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.830> there

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
great and they stick right back on there

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.500 
great and they stick right back on there
you<00:02:33.520> know<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.700> would<00:02:33.940> almost<00:02:34.090> think<00:02:34.270> they

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you know you would almost think they

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.750 
you know you would almost think they
were<00:02:34.570> easy<00:02:34.870> mounted<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.250> see<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.580> one

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
were easy mounted and you see that one

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
were easy mounted and you see that one
is<00:02:36.910> slightly<00:02:37.360> uneven<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.440> back<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:38.860> it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
is slightly uneven in the back but it

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.560 
is slightly uneven in the back but it
still<00:02:39.190> stamps<00:02:39.520> just<00:02:39.580> fine<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> tried<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.450> out

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
still stamps just fine I tried it out

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.170 
still stamps just fine I tried it out
and<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:41.080> was<00:02:41.230> fine<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:41.500> I'm<00:02:42.310> just

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and it was fine so I'm just

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.670 
and it was fine so I'm just
demonstrating<00:02:43.480> how<00:02:44.080> they<00:02:44.200> don't<00:02:44.440> come<00:02:44.650> off

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
demonstrating how they don't come off

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.280 
demonstrating how they don't come off
and<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:46.030> mean<00:02:46.180> worst<00:02:46.360> case<00:02:46.540> scenario<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:46.990> do

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and I mean worst case scenario you do

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.530 
and I mean worst case scenario you do
have<00:02:47.440> more<00:02:47.620> tack<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.040> off<00:02:48.160> attack<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.240> back<00:02:49.360> on

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
have more tack it off attack it back on

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.910 
have more tack it off attack it back on
and<00:02:49.690> off<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.080> could<00:02:50.200> always<00:02:50.320> add<00:02:50.590> more<00:02:50.830> if

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
and off so you could always add more if

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.010 
and off so you could always add more if
you<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.430> need<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.780> see

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
you really need it to and if you see

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.450 
you really need it to and if you see
that<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.290> stamp<00:02:53.710> still<00:02:53.920> has<00:02:54.070> those<00:02:54.250> white

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
that that stamp still has those white

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.310 
that that stamp still has those white
parts<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.910> means<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.210> not<00:02:55.420> fully<00:02:55.780> dry<00:02:56.110> yet

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
parts that means it's not fully dry yet

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.990 
parts that means it's not fully dry yet
so<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.950> want<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.190> wait<00:02:57.310> till<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.640> don't<00:02:57.820> see

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
so you want to wait till you don't see

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.450 
so you want to wait till you don't see
any<00:02:58.180> more<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.570> whiteness<00:02:59.170> left<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
any more of that whiteness left on it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.490 
any more of that whiteness left on it
like<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.420> practically<00:03:01.960> dry<00:03:02.200> except

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
like that one is practically dry except

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.290 
like that one is practically dry except
for<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.710> one<00:03:02.860> little<00:03:03.160> white<00:03:03.310> spot<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.910> you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
for that one little white spot and you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.360 
for that one little white spot and you
can<00:03:04.450> even<00:03:04.570> touch<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.200> your<00:03:05.320> finger<00:03:05.710> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
can even touch it with your finger to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.920 
can even touch it with your finger to
touch<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.700> tackiness<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.630> make<00:03:07.780> sure

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
touch the tackiness but just make sure

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.990 
touch the tackiness but just make sure
that<00:03:08.170> all<00:03:08.590> those<00:03:08.800> white<00:03:09.070> spots<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:09.820> gone

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that all those white spots have gone

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.110 
that all those white spots have gone
clear<00:03:10.360> before<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.110> put<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.410> your<00:03:11.560> casing

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
clear before you put it on your casing

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.880 
clear before you put it on your casing
so<00:03:13.120> now<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.420> piece<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.960> did<00:03:14.170> earlier<00:03:14.560> is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
so now the piece that I did earlier is

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.810 
so now the piece that I did earlier is
fully<00:03:15.700> dry<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.100> see<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.430> kind<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.610> has<00:03:18.670> a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
fully dry you can see it kind of has a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.930 
fully dry you can see it kind of has a
coat<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.930> lawsy<00:03:20.440> coat<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.220> if<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.790> can

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
coat to it lawsy coat and if you can

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.080 
coat to it lawsy coat and if you can
hear<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.870> maybe<00:03:23.860> if<00:03:23.950> my<00:03:24.100> dog<00:03:24.280> will<00:03:24.520> stop<00:03:24.760> moving

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
hear it maybe if my dog will stop moving

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.040 
hear it maybe if my dog will stop moving
around<00:03:25.180> you'll<00:03:25.570> hear<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.870> got<00:03:29.020> a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
around you'll hear it it's got a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.480 
around you'll hear it it's got a
tackiness<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.740> it

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.600 

and<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:36.260> want<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.560> wait<00:03:36.680> till<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:37.010> fully<00:03:37.280> dry

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
and you want to wait till it's fully dry

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.460 
and you want to wait till it's fully dry
before<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.450> use<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.080> want<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.320> make<00:03:39.440> sure

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
before you use it you want to make sure

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.530 
before you use it you want to make sure
like<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:40.040> showed<00:03:40.220> earlier<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:40.820> got<00:03:41.000> no<00:03:41.240> white

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
like I showed earlier it's got no white

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.140 
like I showed earlier it's got no white
left<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.190> don't<00:03:43.280> want<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.610> put<00:03:43.820> so

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
left to it and you don't want to put so

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.810 
left to it and you don't want to put so
much<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.320> huge<00:03:45.620> white<00:03:45.860> coat<00:03:46.130> it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
much that it's like a huge white coat it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.200 
much that it's like a huge white coat it
doesn't<00:03:47.270> need<00:03:47.420> very<00:03:47.720> much<00:03:47.960> just<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.470> thin<00:03:48.710> layer

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
doesn't need very much just a thin layer

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.210 
doesn't need very much just a thin layer
so<00:03:50.210> you<00:03:50.270> can<00:03:50.450> see<00:03:50.690> right<00:03:51.020> now<00:03:51.080> it's<00:03:51.680> perfectly

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
so you can see right now it's perfectly

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.350 
so you can see right now it's perfectly
sticking<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.820> my<00:03:52.940> acrylic<00:03:53.330> block<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:54.910> if<00:03:55.910> I

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
sticking to my acrylic block and if I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.100 
sticking to my acrylic block and if I
pull<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.750> up<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:59.600> comes<00:03:59.900> right<00:04:00.110> off<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.470> block

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
pull it up it comes right off the block

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.660 
pull it up it comes right off the block
leaving<00:04:03.110> no<00:04:03.260> residue<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.980> my<00:04:04.310> acrylic<00:04:04.640> block

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
leaving no residue just my acrylic block

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.610 
leaving no residue just my acrylic block
is<00:04:04.970> dirty<00:04:05.210> itself<00:04:05.600> but<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.110> should<00:04:06.440> leave

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
is dirty itself but it it should leave

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.600 
is dirty itself but it it should leave
no<00:04:06.800> residue<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.390> should<00:04:08.540> come<00:04:08.690> off<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.140> on

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
no residue and it should come off and on

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.000 
no residue and it should come off and on
just<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.780> give<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.350> perfectly

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
just like that and give a perfectly

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.440 
just like that and give a perfectly
clear<00:04:13.250> impression<00:04:13.880> which<00:04:14.000> I'm<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.180> gonna

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
clear impression which I'm just gonna

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.600 
clear impression which I'm just gonna
show<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.720> guys<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.440> part<00:04:16.160> of<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.340> reason

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
show you guys and part of the reason

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.220 
show you guys and part of the reason
that<00:04:16.730> I'm<00:04:16.910> doing<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.450> is<00:04:17.690> because<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:18.170> the

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
that I'm doing this is because of the

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.630 
that I'm doing this is because of the
fact<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:20.650> these<00:04:21.650> are<00:04:21.800> my<00:04:21.890> dollar<00:04:22.100> stamps

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
fact that these are my dollar stamps

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.220 
fact that these are my dollar stamps
that<00:04:23.000> I'm<00:04:23.120> always<00:04:23.270> talking<00:04:23.540> about<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:24.110> my

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
that I'm always talking about in my

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.870 
that I'm always talking about in my
hauls<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.190> know<00:04:25.310> take<00:04:25.520> up<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.730> lot<00:04:25.850> of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
hauls that you know take up a lot of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
hauls that you know take up a lot of
space<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:27.650> just<00:04:28.010> want<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:29.290> be<00:04:30.290> able<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.620> have

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
space and I just want to be able to have

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.040 
space and I just want to be able to have
more<00:04:31.250> rooms<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:31.940> figured<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.630> would<00:04:32.780> try<00:04:32.930> this

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
more rooms so I figured I would try this

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.190 
more rooms so I figured I would try this
method<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.680> I've<00:04:33.950> seen<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:35.080> Stampin<00:04:36.080> Up

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
method that I've seen a Stampin Up

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.530 
method that I've seen a Stampin Up
demonstrator<00:04:36.380> show<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.640> forget<00:04:38.270> what<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.450> name

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
demonstrator show I forget what the name

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.600 
demonstrator show I forget what the name
of<00:04:38.690> her<00:04:38.810> video<00:04:39.170> is<00:04:39.380> but<00:04:39.650> if<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.040> find<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.520> I

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
of her video is but if I can find it I

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.130 
of her video is but if I can find it I
will<00:04:40.640> put<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.060> link<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.600> so<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:41.930> see

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
will put a link to it so you can see

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.160 
will put a link to it so you can see
what<00:04:42.260> she<00:04:42.470> does<00:04:42.620> as<00:04:42.830> well<00:04:43.660> she's<00:04:44.660> onna<00:04:44.840> gave<00:04:45.020> me

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
what she does as well she's onna gave me

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.670 
what she does as well she's onna gave me
the<00:04:45.290> idea<00:04:45.650> for<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.050> see<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.500> get<00:04:48.650> a

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the idea for this and you see you get a

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.480 
the idea for this and you see you get a
clear<00:04:48.920> impression<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.850> then<00:04:50.780> afterwards<00:04:51.490> you

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
clear impression and then afterwards you

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.100 
clear impression and then afterwards you
just<00:04:52.700> take<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.210> off<00:04:53.270> like<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.870> would<00:04:54.020> if

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
just take it right off like you would if

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.650 
just take it right off like you would if
it<00:04:54.200> was<00:04:54.290> easy<00:04:54.500> mounted<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.700> you<00:04:56.300> put<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.630> right

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
it was easy mounted and you put it right

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.710 
it was easy mounted and you put it right
in<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.800> case<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.430> what<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.760> love<00:04:59.090> about<00:04:59.270> this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
in the case and what I love about this

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.530 
in the case and what I love about this
method<00:05:00.020> as<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.380> can<00:05:00.650> see<00:05:00.890> is<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:02.000> using<00:05:02.210> right

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
method as you can see is I'm using right

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.510 
method as you can see is I'm using right
now<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.720> clear<00:05:03.110> case<00:05:03.410> from<00:05:03.620> Stampin<00:05:04.100> Up<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.370> no

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
now a clear case from Stampin Up and no

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.400 
now a clear case from Stampin Up and no
I'm<00:05:04.640> not<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.910> demonstrator<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.910> fits<00:05:08.410> all

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
I'm not a demonstrator and it fits all

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.940 
I'm not a demonstrator and it fits all
those<00:05:09.980> clear<00:05:10.400> stamps<00:05:10.910> on<00:05:11.080> all<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.320> stamps<00:05:12.800> on

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
those clear stamps on all the stamps on

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.970 
those clear stamps on all the stamps on
each<00:05:13.190> side<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:13.550> I'm<00:05:14.180> using<00:05:14.900> up<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:15.470> much<00:05:15.620> less

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
each side so I'm using up so much less

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.830 
each side so I'm using up so much less
space<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.670> I<00:05:16.700> can<00:05:16.730> use<00:05:17.000> both<00:05:17.210> sides<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.750> the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
space and I can use both sides of the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.440 
space and I can use both sides of the
case<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.670> continue<00:05:19.670> to<00:05:19.790> fill<00:05:20.030> up<00:05:20.180> with<00:05:20.210> the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
case to continue to fill up with the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.580 
case to continue to fill up with the
rest<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.810> stamps<00:05:21.140> that<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.320> will<00:05:21.470> be

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
rest of the stamps that I will be

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.340 
rest of the stamps that I will be
unmounting<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.940> it's<00:05:23.180> gonna<00:05:23.360> really<00:05:23.810> save<00:05:24.140> me

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
unmounting so it's gonna really save me

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.320 
unmounting so it's gonna really save me
room<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.860> since<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.400> don't<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.760> my<00:05:25.940> own<00:05:26.000> craft

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.000 
room and since I don't have my own craft
room<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.720> have<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> little<00:05:27.170> craft<00:05:27.410> corner<00:05:27.740> within

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
room I have a little craft corner within

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.890 
room I have a little craft corner within

able<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.430> use<00:05:34.550> this<00:05:34.640> method<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:35.180> something

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
able to use this method on something

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.360 
able to use this method on something
maybe<00:05:35.750> similar<00:05:36.140> I<00:05:36.560> wouldn't<00:05:37.220> necessarily

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
maybe similar I wouldn't necessarily

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.310 
maybe similar I wouldn't necessarily
recommend<00:05:37.820> doing<00:05:38.390> this<00:05:38.540> on<00:05:38.750> your<00:05:38.900> favorite

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
recommend doing this on your favorite

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.730 
recommend doing this on your favorite
stamps<00:05:39.740> because<00:05:39.890> I<00:05:40.130> mean<00:05:41.320> just<00:05:42.320> in<00:05:42.440> case<00:05:42.560> when

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
stamps because I mean just in case when

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.110 
stamps because I mean just in case when
you're<00:05:42.860> cutting<00:05:43.040> them<00:05:43.310> sometimes<00:05:43.820> it<00:05:43.940> does

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
you're cutting them sometimes it does

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.969 
you're cutting them sometimes it does
get<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.450> bit

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.249 

tedious<00:05:47.699> and<00:05:47.999> you<00:05:48.060> can<00:05:48.389> maybe<00:05:48.629> cut<00:05:48.960> them

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
tedious and you can maybe cut them

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:50.869 
tedious and you can maybe cut them
slightly<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.919> even<00:05:50.189> when<00:05:50.310> you're<00:05:50.460> using<00:05:50.639> the

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
slightly and even when you're using the

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.179 
slightly and even when you're using the
craft<00:05:51.150> blade<00:05:51.449> if<00:05:51.599> you're<00:05:51.689> not<00:05:51.810> careful<00:05:52.189> but

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
craft blade if you're not careful but

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.309 
craft blade if you're not careful but
for<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.090> most<00:05:54.270> part<00:05:54.389> I<00:05:54.749> don't<00:05:54.930> think<00:05:55.169> that

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
for the most part I don't think that

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.149 
for the most part I don't think that
that<00:05:55.409> matters<00:05:55.830> because<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:58.009> spiderweb<00:05:59.009> I

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
that matters because the spiderweb I

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.189 
that matters because the spiderweb I
just<00:05:59.370> showed<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.639> is<00:05:59.849> slightly<00:06:00.240> cut<00:06:00.599> even<00:06:01.050> and

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
just showed you is slightly cut even and

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.230 
just showed you is slightly cut even and
it<00:06:01.289> still<00:06:01.590> stamps<00:06:01.949> just<00:06:02.039> fine<00:06:02.430> but<00:06:02.819> I'm

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
it still stamps just fine but I'm

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.059 
it still stamps just fine but I'm
amazing<00:06:03.569> mostly<00:06:04.050> doing<00:06:04.259> this<00:06:04.469> from<00:06:04.710> my<00:06:04.860> dollar

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
amazing mostly doing this from my dollar

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.640 
amazing mostly doing this from my dollar
stamps<00:06:05.789> and<00:06:05.909> smaller<00:06:06.779> stamps<00:06:07.169> I<00:06:07.259> may<00:06:07.439> end<00:06:07.560> up

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
stamps and smaller stamps I may end up

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.469 
stamps and smaller stamps I may end up
doing<00:06:07.979> this<00:06:08.099> for<00:06:08.400> my<00:06:08.520> larger<00:06:08.909> stamps<00:06:09.240> but<00:06:09.419> I

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
doing this for my larger stamps but I

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.959 
doing this for my larger stamps but I
would<00:06:09.659> possibly<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:10.319> using<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:10.680> ez<00:06:11.370> mount<00:06:11.669> foam

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
would possibly be using a ez mount foam

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.700 
would possibly be using a ez mount foam
which<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.719> reason<00:06:12.870> I'm<00:06:13.050> not<00:06:13.080> using<00:06:13.229> it<00:06:13.499> for

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
which the reason I'm not using it for

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.019 
which the reason I'm not using it for
these<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:14.009> because<00:06:14.189> I<00:06:14.249> really<00:06:14.490> wanted<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:14.819> try

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
these is because I really wanted to try

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.459 
these is because I really wanted to try
this<00:06:15.060> method<00:06:15.449> and<00:06:15.749> it<00:06:15.900> seems<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.229> be<00:06:16.319> working

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
this method and it seems to be working

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.679 
this method and it seems to be working
