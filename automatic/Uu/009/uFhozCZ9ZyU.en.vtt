to rinse it and chop it up into pieces

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.010 
to rinse it and chop it up into pieces
and<00:00:21.240> dump<00:00:21.509> it<00:00:21.599> into<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:21.869> blender<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.930> this

and dump it into your blender to this
we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> add<00:00:25.700> one<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> half<00:00:27.000> cups

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
we're going to add one and a half cups

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.499 
we're going to add one and a half cups
of<00:00:27.419> pineapple<00:00:28.669> and<00:00:29.669> if<00:00:29.790> you<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.090> frozen

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
of pineapple and if you have frozen

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.080 
of pineapple and if you have frozen
that's<00:00:31.410> great<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.220> frozen<00:00:32.399> peaches<00:00:32.759> here

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that's great I have frozen peaches here

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.610 
that's great I have frozen peaches here
this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> half<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> cup<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> frozen<00:00:34.290> peaches

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this is a half a cup of frozen peaches

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680 
this is a half a cup of frozen peaches
and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> frozen<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.149> better<00:00:36.329> because

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and I think the frozen is better because

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.940 
and I think the frozen is better because
it<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:36.809> makes<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> smoothie<00:00:37.680> really

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it actually makes the smoothie really

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.110 
it actually makes the smoothie really
cold<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.960> tastes<00:00:40.200> butter<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
cold so I think it tastes butter and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
cold so I think it tastes butter and
then<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.510> we're<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.380> to<00:00:43.500> add<00:00:43.670> one

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
then to this we're going to add one

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
then to this we're going to add one
