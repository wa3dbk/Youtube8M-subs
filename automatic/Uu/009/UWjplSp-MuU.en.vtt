00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.290
 they saw each other again at the university 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.660
 of caldas the faces of amazement of 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.309
 questions and expectations and everything 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.960
 because the day of the induction was reached 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:31.149
 for the new students of the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520
 caldas university who in his 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.980
 first day they brought their full backpacks 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.320
 of dreams and many purposes for 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.829
 start what for them was the beginning 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 of a new life 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.050
 from all over the country they arrived at the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.059
 university 1100 young people that we 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.269
 they shared what their expectations are 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 for this start my expectations are 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.089
 to be able to develop very well in my 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 career have my profession very soon 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.430
 I hope and nothing I hope to be very judicious 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.610
 my expectations are basically you can 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.159
 forge a future and you can learn a lot 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.009
 basically that's my expectations here 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.479
 in college they are expanding my 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.610
 knowledge and learn more from the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.959
 culture and already this grow 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.110
 professionally learn to make a 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.789
 better professional and this time the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 induction to the primiparous brought a 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.799
 Special guest was the Peruvian 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 josÃ© falcon who is a philosopher and has 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.520
 studies at harvard university and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.679
 wanted to share with the new 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.110
 students some experiences of their 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.390
 beginnings as a university but he 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.000
 serve something in terms of whether I can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 get there because they do not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.840
 and on the other hand I also think that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.190
 Somehow we are called to innovate 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.650
 supposedly what that world asks for is 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.630
 innovation, innovation, innovation and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.750
 The only way to innovate is to create 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 an own identity to know who is 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.690
 one 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100
 and to be able to achieve that once again the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.420
 university the university years are 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.619
 really important because if one does not 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.610
 manages to articulate a different voice but 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.730
 make others will not be able to innovate 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.360
 that voice the creation of that voice during 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.200
 those years involves a lot of reading like 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.200
 I say a lot of confusion
