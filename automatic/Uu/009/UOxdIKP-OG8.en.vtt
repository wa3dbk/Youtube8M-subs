00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.200 
realize unless you are in the United
States<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:32.320> location<00:00:32.800> services<00:00:33.399> for<00:00:33.760> finding

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
States the location services for finding

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.350 
States the location services for finding
businesses<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.440> everything<00:00:35.920> else<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:37.150> won't

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
businesses and everything else it won't

work unless you're in the United States

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.520 
work unless you're in the United States
but<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.300> thing<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.540> I'm<00:00:40.750> finding<00:00:41.050> is<00:00:41.500> that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
but the thing that I'm finding is that

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.850 
but the thing that I'm finding is that
the<00:00:42.100> language<00:00:42.490> settings<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:44.170> driving<00:00:44.739> the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
the language settings are driving the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.040 
the language settings are driving the
location<00:00:45.370> services<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:47.620> I<00:00:47.860> set<00:00:48.540> Siri<00:00:49.540> to

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
location services so if I set Siri to

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
location services so if I set Siri to
Australian<00:00:51.010> English<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.640> she<00:00:51.760> really

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
Australian English and she really

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.590 
Australian English and she really
understands<00:00:54.640> me<00:00:54.940> really<00:00:55.329> well<00:00:55.570> in<00:00:55.980> Australian

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
understands me really well in Australian

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.870 
understands me really well in Australian
and<00:00:58.600> yes<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.320> separate<00:00:59.739> language<00:00:59.890> you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
and yes it is a separate language you

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.460 
and yes it is a separate language you
think<00:01:00.910> it's<00:01:01.300> English<00:01:01.480> it's<00:01:01.930> not<00:01:02.050> as

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
think it's English it's not as

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.950 
think it's English it's not as
Australian<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.750> strong<00:01:06.270> she<00:01:07.270> understands<00:01:07.810> me

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
Australian or strong she understands me

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.230 
Australian or strong she understands me
really<00:01:08.259> well<00:01:08.439> but<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.310> location<00:01:09.760> services

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
really well but the location services

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.840 
really well but the location services
don't<00:01:10.479> work<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:11.170> Kai<00:01:11.409> she<00:01:11.920> assumes<00:01:12.280> I'm<00:01:12.520> in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
don't work it's Kai she assumes I'm in

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.060 
don't work it's Kai she assumes I'm in
Australia<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.990> guess<00:01:14.470> it's<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.710> subtle<00:01:14.860> way

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
Australia and I guess it's a subtle way

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.420 
Australia and I guess it's a subtle way
of<00:01:15.100> saying<00:01:15.370> go<00:01:15.580> home<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.830> unless<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:21.040> set<00:01:21.340> it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
of saying go home so so unless I set it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.850 
of saying go home so so unless I set it
to<00:01:21.580> English<00:01:21.940> United<00:01:22.180> States<00:01:22.659> then<00:01:23.170> location

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
to English United States then location

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.280 
to English United States then location
services<00:01:24.220> have<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> bit<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.030> problem

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.380

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.629 

oh<00:02:56.489> nice<00:02:57.489> isn't<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:58.510> um<00:02:58.959> watch<00:02:59.769> out<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
oh nice isn't it so um watch out if the

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.129 
oh nice isn't it so um watch out if the
kiddies<00:03:00.879> get<00:03:01.269> their<00:03:01.510> hands<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.349> ciri<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
kiddies get their hands on ciri and

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.559 
kiddies get their hands on ciri and
especially<00:03:05.139> if<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.409> Australian<00:03:05.950> accent

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
especially if I have Australian accent

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.610 
especially if I have Australian accent
you<00:03:07.569> could<00:03:07.749> get<00:03:07.870> into<00:03:08.019> all<00:03:08.109> kinds<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.560> trouble

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you could get into all kinds of trouble

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.599 
you could get into all kinds of trouble
so<00:03:10.170> hopefully<00:03:11.170> when<00:03:11.859> we're<00:03:12.010> out<00:03:12.129> of<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.400> beta

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
so hopefully when we're out of the beta

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.869 
so hopefully when we're out of the beta
testing<00:03:13.120> for<00:03:13.569> Siri<00:03:13.870> we'll<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.879> split

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
testing for Siri we'll get a split

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.059 
testing for Siri we'll get a split
between<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.450> language<00:03:17.260> settings<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
between the language settings and the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.569 
between the language settings and the
location<00:03:18.549> services<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:20.139> mean<00:03:20.709> people<00:03:21.459> have

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
location services I mean people have

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.429 
location services I mean people have
accents<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.269> they<00:03:22.480> don't<00:03:22.689> necessarily<00:03:22.840> live

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
accents and they don't necessarily live

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.679 
accents and they don't necessarily live
in<00:03:23.530> their<00:03:23.680> own<00:03:23.709> country<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.239> would<00:03:25.389> be<00:03:25.510> nice

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
in their own country so it would be nice

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.420 
in their own country so it would be nice
to<00:03:25.719> be<00:03:25.930> able<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.169> search<00:03:26.439> and<00:03:26.680> not<00:03:26.919> be<00:03:27.069> accused

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
to be able to search and not be accused

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.849 
to be able to search and not be accused
of<00:03:27.669> being<00:03:27.730> pornographic<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.200> don't<00:03:29.769> know<00:03:29.829> I

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
of being pornographic and I don't know I

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.229 
of being pornographic and I don't know I
don't<00:03:30.099> think<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.370> want<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.639> go<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:30.939> place<00:03:31.209> that

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
don't think I want to go to a place that

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.580 
don't think I want to go to a place that
has<00:03:31.599> one<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.530> those<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:34.269> hopefully<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.319> don't

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
has one of those so hopefully I don't

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.899 
has one of those so hopefully I don't
know<00:03:35.650> maybe<00:03:35.919> she'll<00:03:36.250> understand<00:03:36.639> me<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> bit
