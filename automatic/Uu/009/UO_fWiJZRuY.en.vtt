00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
side earlier because I think it's my

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:36.550

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.350 

I<00:00:39.800> haven't<00:00:40.490> scraped<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.880> peg<00:00:41.030> on<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.240> other

side

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:12.609 

which<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:01.210> think<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.449> reason<00:01:05.930> for<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.500> is

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.389 

when<00:01:13.280> I'm<00:01:13.460> turning<00:01:13.969> left<00:01:14.710> my<00:01:15.710> throttles<00:01:16.250> on

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
when I'm turning left my throttles on

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.020 
when I'm turning left my throttles on
the<00:01:16.490> outside<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.420> turn<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:19.340> try<00:01:19.759> not<00:01:19.969> to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
the outside of the turn and I try not to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.200 
the outside of the turn and I try not to
put<00:01:20.270> any<00:01:20.570> pressure<00:01:20.810> on<00:01:21.259> my<00:01:21.829> hands<00:01:22.640> at<00:01:22.789> all<00:01:22.909> but

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
put any pressure on my hands at all but

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.270 
put any pressure on my hands at all but
it's<00:01:23.359> still<00:01:23.659> something<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.259> kind<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.859> do<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:25.069> can

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's still something I kind of do I can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.919 
it's still something I kind of do I can
kind<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.549> simple<00:01:25.850> it's<00:01:26.030> not<00:01:26.149> nearly<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:26.659> bad<00:01:26.869> as

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
kind of simple it's not nearly as bad as

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:51.200 
kind of simple it's not nearly as bad as
the<00:01:27.350> first<00:01:28.159> time<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.640> made<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> video<00:01:29.090> like<00:01:29.420> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.890 

I<00:01:51.299> can't<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> feel<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.260> I'm<00:01:52.350> getting<00:01:52.470> twisted

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
I can't I feel like I'm getting twisted

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:21.030 
I can't I feel like I'm getting twisted
that's<00:01:54.900> my<00:01:54.990> problem

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.050 

hey<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.819> getting<00:02:21.940> twisted<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:24.489> my<00:02:24.879> lower

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
hey I'm not getting twisted but my lower

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.910 
hey I'm not getting twisted but my lower
back<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.629> kind<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.019> feels<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.709> little

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
back it kind of feels like it's a little

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920 
back it kind of feels like it's a little
bit<00:02:27.069> twisted<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.640> think<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.150> from<00:02:28.659> my

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
bit twisted but I think that's from my

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.449 
bit twisted but I think that's from my
neck<00:02:29.200> movements<00:02:29.799> looking<00:02:30.220> through<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
neck movements looking through the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.990 
neck movements looking through the
corner<00:02:30.849> I<00:02:32.879> need<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.120> mount<00:02:34.330> like<00:02:34.659> a<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:35.879> have<00:02:36.879> my

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
corner I need to mount like a I have my

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.610 
corner I need to mount like a I have my
GoPro<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.810> back<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.170> seat<00:02:38.440> or

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
GoPro on the back of my seat or

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.410
