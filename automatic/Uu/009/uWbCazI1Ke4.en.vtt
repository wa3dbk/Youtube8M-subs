 but what the hell did you do is a kind of 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:25.869
 Sleeping cock virus resisted pulled 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:29.619
 out who wants success for the exit 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 abrupt earphone ok try to find them in 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.850
 an animus animosa ok animus mousavi per 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.670
 access via helix to memories 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.059
 shay cormack genetic works for 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.160
 the aaps late entertainment you know 20 sounds 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.960
 family members were reminded of a mistake 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.039
 in the session and involves everything 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.649
 the building we find your boss you 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.070
 memories of her true melanie lemay very much 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.280
 active and super ambitious melons yes here 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.289
 keep the communicator use it if you get lost 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.390
 now let's go there is not even time to 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.170
 recover from this shock 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 follow me or arrival arrival this chaos is 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 definitely your fault if the towel 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 we asked with my fault 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.530
 what did I know about that mistake 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.090
 let's get facts as in the exercises of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.640
 safety courage will be all right on 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.579
 cormorants are evacuating I did not think 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.380
 mica was so bad what is 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.299
 happening a file called shaye 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.979
 cormack contained a trap virus 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.170
 it is up to you to prevent this 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.500
 we must contain these memories then there 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.960
 we will destroy isolated I want to study them 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.140
 these memories but with all respect 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.600
 to emails is not a search 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.780
 you felt it right you would need yours 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.340
 touch or ok miss mail I heard 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.350
 maybe it will seem a little weird but 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.240
 I should work for clients there 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.750
 they hired to enhance the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.219
 safety 8 berg and violet from coast only 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.840
 violet please I ask myself to 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.600
 check out our I prepare for 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.969
 print do what they tell you to do 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.969
 ok force team sir 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.280
 technically you are not responsible but you have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 let the virus out so it's right 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.599
 that help me to eliminate him from Mr. 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.260
 who wants us to relive the memories of 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.300
 shay to do that we have to access helix 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 but it didn't work restarting server from 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.260
 basement is fine boss or anyone 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.560
 he designed this virus a genius 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.239
 not only does icloud access prevent us but it has 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.769
 compromised other operating systems 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.480
 that govern the building melanie i 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.430
 elevators are out of order we are blocked 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.940
 here shit I will come technicians to 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.580
 sooner 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.370
 there is a server on this floor for now ce 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.959
 we will make it enough for people from the coast 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 I want regular updates on 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.400
 progress of genetic memories of shay 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.720
 because from what I know it is not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.940
 important 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 he made the choir but whom I suspect he is 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
 this small setback could 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.750
 offer us a reward that is waiting 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.750
 proceed to the server room of this plan 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.430
 then we go 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:22.190
 I had to go there I had not picked the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.190
 message where I will go 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.440
 wait a second this situation me 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.980
 I know a lot about déjà vu I have not already pistulated 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.450
 with servers in the past, nothing 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.450
 ginseng I stopped with that stuff 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.360
 here we see a little I can do 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.090
 mechanical and a wireless signal that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.250
 blinks well then you can still 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.330
 access the systems connected to the flow 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.370
 video button circle restored on 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.230
 server will connect the animate cassation 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.330
 helix aligning the rays and segments 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.010
 of the core I should solve the problem 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.690
 but this is where it gets complicated 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.640
 you have to move the circuses so that each 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.209
 segment is powered by a beam 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.220
 I recommend every secret only 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.410
 for each segment of the core ok 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.160
 when everything will be fed the system 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:24.240
 serious true understood from try again 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 long boss we see this tutorial 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.200
 reflective reflective transparent 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.690
 defesore I have to light up all the parts 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.690
 then the one from before 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.550
 this nucleus was not complex a 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.110
 restarting the year had passed into the rest 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.110
 building will require work 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.290
 the killers want to make you believe that 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.810
 al muallim was a great mentor who 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.880
 he became greedy and corrupt and cooperated 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.480
 with the Templars to get an apple 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.670
 dell'eden 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.020
 I instead see a shrewd and shrewd garment 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.410
 a man who used his killer 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.170
 best altair to eliminate others 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.330
 conspirators and keep the apple for themselves so 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.710
 to use it to ensure peace in 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.720
 world 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.320
 despite the muallim was not a 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.050
 Templar 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.150
 it is interesting to note how his 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.760
 vision of peace was more in line 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.820
 with the Templar philosophy than with that 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.040
 of the killers in the past both 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.470
 factions had peace as their purpose 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.650
 the only difference was the methods with 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.810
 to get it if the muallim was not 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.760
 was killed by altair and had 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.390
 continued his plan 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.460
 maybe today we won't fight alone 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.410
 after altair introduced the new one 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.750
 ideal of free will in 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.650
 brotherhood that the conflict is 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.840
 exacerbates and spread throughout the world 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.360
 because if the so-called essay of the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.250
 mountain can see things from ours 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.200
 point of view 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.560
 certainly others can too 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.560
 killers 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.350
 because I've seen this stuff here I 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.710
 just restarted the server mica ho 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.710
 violated 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.240
 ok i don't know if you should have seen it 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:27.170
 anyway, I better get back to yours 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.420
 animus with servers running again 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.120
 you could restore the workstations of 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.750
 work of your colleagues if you want to give 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.970
 a hand 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.270
 the snake you could find others 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.210
 useful things if you like to be a little 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.760
 sneak maybe another time 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.160
 you say colleague left his 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.500
 communicator in the elevator bramble seat 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.340
 hi tech on the ground collect the could 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.470
 provide us with the beginnings you have now 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.780
 unlocked the memories of sheikh osman 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.990
 we are about to make a big one 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.990
 discovery 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.940
 I know you have a lot of questions on yours 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.490
 new task or on me 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.090
 for now i can only tell you that history 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.070
 of sheikh will provide 6th answers 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.200
 will lead a deeper knowledge 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.110
 okay mr vda ie mr 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.420
 bergher better than you get back to work 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:24.190
 now but what part 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.360
 my post was not from another 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.970
 part once assassin's creed rising 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.700
 phoenix will be another of those projects 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.060
 like the one set in China is yes 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.640
 will have to warn sean and rebecca about it 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:42.730
 here are my comics and my i 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.540
 my books a lot of litter must 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.540
 put in place later 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:56.849
 a model has fallen I pick it up later 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.849
 but let's get back to work
