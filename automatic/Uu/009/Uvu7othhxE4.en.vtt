I find this is the best way to wake up
in<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.569> morning<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.259> turn<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.500> my

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
in the morning when I just turn on my

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
in the morning when I just turn on my
camera<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.370> day<00:00:08.490> hasn't<00:00:08.820> even<00:00:09.000> begun<00:00:09.210> yet

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
camera and my day hasn't even begun yet

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
camera and my day hasn't even begun yet
and<00:00:09.840> it's<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.260> early<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.980> find<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.700> I'm<00:00:11.849> always

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and it's so early I find that I'm always

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.490 
and it's so early I find that I'm always
filming<00:00:12.570> either<00:00:12.840> first<00:00:13.170> thing<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
filming either first thing in the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.049

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
morning or really late at night I think
it's<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> most<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.350> alone

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.210 
just manually type in where you want it
to<00:04:01.450> search<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.350> know<00:04:02.500> coupon<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.190> deal

to search so I know coupon and deal

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.500 
to search so I know coupon and deal
searching<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.880> really<00:04:04.150> big<00:04:04.300> right<00:04:04.450> now

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
searching is really big right now

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.330

there's a lot of sites that are doing it

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.560 
there's a lot of sites that are doing it
but<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.519> think<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.910> one<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.120> good<00:04:07.300> because<00:04:07.450> it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
but I think this one is good because it

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.540 
but I think this one is good because it
just<00:04:07.780> kind<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.080> compiles<00:04:08.680> everything<00:04:09.130> it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
just kind of compiles everything it

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
makes it really easy and I saw a

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.370 
makes it really easy and I saw a
statistic<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.480> wanted<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> ask<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.260> guys

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
about so I read the ninety percent of

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.350 
about so I read the ninety percent of
women<00:04:22.380> would<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> second<00:04:24.030> date<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.330> a
