Hello! I am Andrew from

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.100
www.InMyLingo.com

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.100
SorensonVRS  contacted me and asked me

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.100
if I would be willing to test out their new products

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.100
nTouch.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.100
I was intrigued to find out  more details. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.100
Sorenson explained that a trainer would come and install nTouch PC on my laptop.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.100
Then I will play with it for awhile. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.100
Finally, write up a review on it and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
share my thoughts with Sorenson and with you.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100
I thought that sounds like fun.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.100
So the trainer did come and install nTouch PC

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.100
on my laptop quickly, which was nice.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.100
Then I got to play with it all day and made several different calls. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.100
Finally, I have just completed 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.100
making my review on it.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.100
I posted it on 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.100
http://www.inmylingo.com/blog

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.100
Now, I was thinking that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.100
you all might like to see how to make

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.100
a VRS call or a Point to Point call??? 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.100
Let me show a demo quickly. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.100
There is the icon

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:39.100
and I'm going to click on it. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.100
Now, I'm going to log in.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.100
That's what it looks like. 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.100
I thought it was very clean and easy to use. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.100
Now who should I call? Mmm.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.100
How about calling myself on VP200? 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.100
Let's check that out. 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100
[Ringing]

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.100
Hey! How are you doing?? It's been awhile! 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.100
What do you think of the video quality? 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.100
I'm curious. What do you think? 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.100
Let me know and thank you for watching!
