they're aiming for it's not quite zadran
rabanne<00:02:37.060> territory<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.319> still<00:02:38.440> super

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
rabanne territory but it's still super

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.830 
rabanne territory but it's still super
difficult<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.310> achieve<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.819> izzy<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.569> having

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
difficult to achieve and izzy is having

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.360 
difficult to achieve and izzy is having
to<00:02:40.930> work<00:02:41.049> really<00:02:41.380> hard<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.799> improving<00:02:42.130> those

Martin<00:02:42.700> back<00:02:42.880> skills

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.059 

okay<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.390> noticed<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.680> shop

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
okay so I noticed on that on that shop

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.640 
okay so I noticed on that on that shop
turn<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.599> lost<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.900> bit<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.049> ground<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.500> me

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
turn that you lost a bit of ground on me

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
turn that you lost a bit of ground on me
I<00:02:52.040> could<00:02:52.400> yo<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.610> skidding<00:02:53.120> yeah<00:02:53.569> so<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> think

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
I could yo you skidding yeah so I think

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.270 
I could yo you skidding yeah so I think
what<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.260> did<00:02:54.349> was<00:02:54.409> instead<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.010> breaking

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
what you did was instead of breaking

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.089 
what you did was instead of breaking
before<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> turn<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:57.230> braked<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.890> turn

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
before the turn you braked in the turn

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.559 
before the turn you braked in the turn
and<00:02:58.280> obviously<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.060> happens<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
and obviously what that happens is you

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.539 
and obviously what that happens is you
lose<00:02:59.750> quite<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.019> bit<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.319> momentum<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.340> then

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
lose quite a bit of momentum and then

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.490 
lose quite a bit of momentum and then
you<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.790> really<00:03:02.090> put<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.079> lot<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.230> car

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you have to really put in a lot of car

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.110 
you have to really put in a lot of car
to<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:03.860> again<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:04.340> what<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.579> do<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.849> as<00:03:05.030> soon

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
to get it again so what I do is as soon

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.660 
to get it again so what I do is as soon
as<00:03:05.329> I<00:03:05.420> post<00:03:05.659> the<00:03:05.840> apex<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.319> turn<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.950> really

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
as I post the apex of the turn I really

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.399 
as I post the apex of the turn I really
start<00:03:07.940> powering<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.480> pedaling<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:08.930> you'll

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
start powering and pedaling and you'll

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.559 
start powering and pedaling and you'll
find<00:03:09.650> in<00:03:09.829> fifty<00:03:10.519> corners<00:03:10.879> you<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.000> make<00:03:11.269> 30

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
find in fifty corners you can make 30

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.660 
find in fifty corners you can make 30
