important<00:03:39.190> though<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:40.150> part<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
important though it's part of the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.150 
important though it's part of the
development<00:03:40.810> process<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.709> team<00:03:41.920> to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
development process for the team to

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.610 
development process for the team to
continue<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:43.030> grow<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.239> thought<00:03:43.750> some<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.440> our

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
continue to grow I thought some of our

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.979 
continue to grow I thought some of our
young<00:03:44.769> guys<00:03:44.950> did<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> real<00:03:45.370> good<00:03:45.400> job<00:03:45.840> later<00:03:46.840> in

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
young guys did a real good job later in

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.539 
young guys did a real good job later in
this<00:03:47.110> game<00:03:47.170> compared<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.860> later<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.160> last<00:03:48.340> game

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
this game compared to later in last game

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.890 
this game compared to later in last game
and<00:03:48.670> that's<00:03:48.760> just<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.120> steps<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.600> think

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and that's just the steps that you think

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.360 
and that's just the steps that you think
as<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.079> young<00:03:50.320> players<00:03:50.620> learning<00:03:51.040> how<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.310> in

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
as a young players learning how to be in

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.520 
as a young players learning how to be in
these<00:03:51.489> situations<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.140> think<00:03:53.290> when

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
these situations and so I think when

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.960 
these situations and so I think when
you're<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.739> them<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.040> good<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.820> can

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
you're in them it's good and if you can

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.280 
you're in them it's good and if you can
be<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.239> them<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.480> finally<00:03:55.720> it's<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.049> point

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
be in them and finally it's the point

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.289 
be in them and finally it's the point
that's<00:03:56.530> great<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:57.310> guys<00:03:57.459> had<00:03:57.790> multiple

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that's great you guys had multiple

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.000 
that's great you guys had multiple
opportunities<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.140> power<00:03:59.320> planer<00:03:59.560> person

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
opportunities in the power planer person

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.460 
opportunities in the power planer person
there<00:04:00.370> came<00:04:01.060> up<00:04:01.209> short<00:04:01.450> talk<00:04:02.110> about<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.320> power

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
there came up short talk about the power

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.780 
there came up short talk about the power
play<00:04:02.650> tonight

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
play tonight

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.449 
play tonight
well<00:04:04.689> I<00:04:04.719> think<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:05.230> think<00:04:05.620> their<00:04:05.739> third<00:04:06.129> in<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
well I think I think their third in the

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.880 
well I think I think their third in the
league<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:06.670> PK<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.689> so<00:04:08.290> they<00:04:08.439> do<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.620> real<00:04:08.859> good

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
league in PK and so they do a real good

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.130 
league in PK and so they do a real good
job<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.430> penalty<00:04:09.670> kill<00:04:09.939> I<00:04:10.719> thought<00:04:10.959> we<00:04:11.109> had

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
job with a penalty kill I thought we had

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.809 
job with a penalty kill I thought we had
a<00:04:11.230> couple<00:04:11.530> looks<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.189> first<00:04:12.459> they<00:04:12.640> don't

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
a couple looks in the first they don't

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.399 
a couple looks in the first they don't
they<00:04:13.120> don't<00:04:13.150> over<00:04:13.659> pressure<00:04:13.930> they<00:04:14.140> really

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
they don't over pressure they really

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.780 
they don't over pressure they really
protect<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.950> inside<00:04:15.219> of<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> ice<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.670> so

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
protect the inside of the ice and so

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.860 
protect the inside of the ice and so
you're<00:04:15.909> going<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.090> end<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.269> with<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.539> shots

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
you're going to end up with the shots

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.930 
you're going to end up with the shots
and<00:04:17.259> we<00:04:17.859> weren't<00:04:18.009> able<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.310> get<00:04:18.459> one<00:04:18.639> through

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
and we weren't able to get one through

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.849 
and we weren't able to get one through
there<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.359> didn't<00:04:19.690> love<00:04:19.900> our<00:04:20.109> power<00:04:20.380> play<00:04:20.650> but

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
there I didn't love our power play but

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.490 
there I didn't love our power play but
in<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.000> end<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.330> found<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.660> way<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.840> score<00:04:23.229> late

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
in the end it found a way to score late

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.279 
in the end it found a way to score late
on<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.889> second<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:25.240> power<00:04:25.630> plant<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:26.139> this

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
on the second that power plant in this

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.320 
on the second that power plant in this
second<00:04:26.680> there<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.070> now<00:04:27.580> we'll<00:04:27.850> take<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.150> goal

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
second there so now we'll take the goal

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.659 
second there so now we'll take the goal
you<00:04:28.630> know<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.020> powerpoint<00:04:29.500> third<00:04:29.889> you'd

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
you know that the powerpoint third you'd

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.400 
you know that the powerpoint third you'd
like<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.060> score<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.570> you're<00:04:31.720> certainly<00:04:31.930> real

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
like to score but you're certainly real

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.379 
like to score but you're certainly real
cautious<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:33.130> preventing<00:04:33.699> one<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.030> sometimes

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
cautious of preventing one so sometimes

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.170 
cautious of preventing one so sometimes
those<00:04:34.539> are<00:04:34.720> hard<00:04:34.870> ones<00:04:35.080> due<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.560> be<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:36.430> think

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
those are hard ones due to be in I think

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.879 
those are hard ones due to be in I think
our<00:04:37.300> power<00:04:37.449> play<00:04:37.660> can<00:04:37.810> still<00:04:38.050> be<00:04:38.169> better<00:04:38.380> we're

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
our power play can still be better we're

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.350 
our power play can still be better we're
continuing<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.400> work<00:04:39.490> out<00:04:39.699> it's<00:04:39.849> showing<00:04:40.120> real

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
continuing to work out it's showing real

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.060 
continuing to work out it's showing real
good<00:04:40.630> signs<00:04:40.930> at<00:04:41.110> times<00:04:41.349> but<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.710> think<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:41.949> can

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
good signs at times but I think it can

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.770 
good signs at times but I think it can
still<00:04:42.250> be<00:04:42.280> better<00:04:42.550> one<00:04:43.000> thing<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.300> said<00:04:43.539> to<00:04:43.570> our

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
still be better one thing I said to our

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.200 
still be better one thing I said to our
guys<00:04:43.930> tonight<00:04:44.259> at<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.530> competitive<00:04:44.979> level<00:04:45.250> was

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
guys tonight at a competitive level was

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.360 
guys tonight at a competitive level was
extremely<00:04:46.240> high<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.500> when<00:04:47.650> we<00:04:47.800> compete<00:04:48.250> to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
extremely high and when we compete to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.100 
extremely high and when we compete to
that<00:04:48.550> high<00:04:48.729> high<00:04:49.000> level<00:04:49.389> like<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.720> boy<00:04:49.900> it's

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that high high level like that boy it's

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.249 
that high high level like that boy it's
hard<00:04:50.349> to<00:04:50.530> it's<00:04:51.190> hard<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.970> beat<00:04:52.150> us<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.900> I

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
hard to it's hard to beat us and I

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.140 
hard to it's hard to beat us and I
thought<00:04:53.800> our<00:04:53.919> décor<00:04:54.340> was<00:04:54.550> great<00:04:54.789> at<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.030> they

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
thought our décor was great at that they

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.749 
thought our décor was great at that they
competed<00:04:55.660> extremely<00:04:56.199> hard<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:57.250> when<00:04:57.639> we

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
competed extremely hard and when we

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.400 
competed extremely hard and when we
needed<00:04:58.060> big<00:04:58.240> saves<00:04:58.509> obviously<00:04:58.960> Peter<00:04:59.199> made

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
needed big saves obviously Peter made

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.180 
needed big saves obviously Peter made
him

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190
