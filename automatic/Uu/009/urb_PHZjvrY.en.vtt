here it's kind of the best thing we
could<00:03:40.200> have<00:03:40.319> thought<00:03:40.500> oh<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.069> actually

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:41.249 
could have thought oh but it actually

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.520 
could have thought oh but it actually
works<00:03:41.609> pretty<00:03:41.730> good<00:03:41.969> just<00:03:42.810> holds<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.200> up<00:03:43.349> like

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
works pretty good just holds it up like

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.220 
works pretty good just holds it up like
that<00:03:46.099> this<00:03:47.099> side<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.760> same<00:03:48.230> there's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
that this side is the same there's

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.280 
that this side is the same there's
thinking<00:03:49.590> something<00:03:49.859> like<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:51.139> but<00:03:52.139> we

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
thinking something like this but we

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
thinking something like this but we
haven't<00:03:52.590> got<00:03:52.829> anything<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.340> hold<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.849> door

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
haven't got anything to hold up the door

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.970 
haven't got anything to hold up the door
on<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.419> side<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:55.109> don't<00:03:55.709> know<00:03:55.799> we<00:03:55.949> just

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
on this side I don't know we just

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:07.610 
on this side I don't know we just
haven't<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.519> got<00:03:56.699> to<00:03:56.879> that<00:03:57.030> yet<00:03:57.060> Oh<00:04:06.349> your<00:04:07.349> top

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
haven't you got to that yet Oh your top

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.000 
haven't you got to that yet Oh your top
is<00:04:07.859> like<00:04:07.889> slanted<00:04:08.849> back<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.569> guess<00:04:10.469> so<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:10.980> just

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
is like slanted back I guess so we just

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.439 
is like slanted back I guess so we just
did<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.730> makes<00:04:11.879> me<00:04:11.969> kind<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.239> look

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
did that and makes me kind of look

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.959 
did that and makes me kind of look
through<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.689> and<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.169> rain<00:04:13.500> would<00:04:13.969> slide

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
through it and see the rain would slide

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.629 
through it and see the rain would slide
back<00:04:18.409> we<00:04:19.409> also<00:04:19.560> go<00:04:19.799> out<00:04:19.919> left<00:04:20.130> your<00:04:20.250> prints<00:04:20.549> all
