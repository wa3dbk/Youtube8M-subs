00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:57.409

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.409

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.769
 Special crossfire frames do not have 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.120
 much use, but it's very 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.300
 interesting 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.540
 they put it right here for the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.030
