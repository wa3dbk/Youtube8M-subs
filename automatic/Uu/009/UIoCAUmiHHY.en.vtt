the most surprising thing here for me is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.710 
the most surprising thing here for me is

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
this phone and the tablet itself and by

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.729 
this phone and the tablet itself and by
the<00:02:54.610> way<00:02:54.820> that's<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.150> one<00:02:55.600> data<00:02:56.410> plan

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.070 
the way that's just one data plan
instead<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.250> two<00:02:57.430> data<00:02:57.640> plans<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> separate

instead of two data plans for a separate

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.190 
instead of two data plans for a separate
phone<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.769> tablet<00:03:00.370> alright<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.360> insert<00:03:02.019> it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
to the back of the tablet just slide it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.740 
to the back of the tablet just slide it
in<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:07.269> should<00:03:07.510> power

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
in like like this and that should power

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.190 
in like like this and that should power
up<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.319> tablet<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.209> 9<00:03:10.420> inch<00:03:10.690> display

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
up the tablet so it's a 9 inch display

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.449 
up the tablet so it's a 9 inch display
lots<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.920> bezel<00:03:12.250> here<00:03:12.730> that's<00:03:13.390> pretty<00:03:13.780> thick

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
lots of bezel here that's pretty thick

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.100 
lots of bezel here that's pretty thick
again<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.640> doesn't<00:03:15.819> feel<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.390> premium

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
again it doesn't feel like a premium

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.750 
again it doesn't feel like a premium
device<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.250> price<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:19.000> only<00:03:20.340> $199<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.579> a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
device but the price is only $199 with a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.240 
device but the price is only $199 with a
two-year<00:03:22.239> contract<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:23.350> it's<00:03:23.620> not<00:03:23.860> that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
two-year contract so it's not that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.140 
two-year contract so it's not that
expensive<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:26.320> get<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:27.610> sort<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:28.000> get

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
expensive and you get you sort of get

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.410 
expensive and you get you sort of get
two<00:03:28.450> devices<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.829> hybrid<00:03:30.420> if

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420
