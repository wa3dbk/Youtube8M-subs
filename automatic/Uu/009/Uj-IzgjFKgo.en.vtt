00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.260
 So we'll start by calling the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.880
 and put two drops 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.880
 olive oil well the center of the planet 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.800
 look so much olive oil well the center 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.470
 the pan 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 Let's not move, let's leave it alone. 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.230
 stopped until it heated up when 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 that it spreads so along the sides 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 It's because it's already good. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 so let's add two onions 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.989
 large cut into cubes 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.430
 Let's pray stirring the onion not to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 let it drop a lot of water 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.260
 after gilding well the onion, she 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.320
 already starting to help fund because 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.170
 have accepted we will add the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.940
 garlic and let it fry very little and already 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.950
 Let's add the tomato 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.190
 a lot of people asked me what I think 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.930
 is the one that I use this normal helium 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.340
 it is not of this treatise alone that it is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.780
 minced and frozen natural looking 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.640
 Only he's coming like that. 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.180
 frozen 2 cloves garlic 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.180
 I'll use 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.250
 after getting a little garlic now 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 We'll have to take it here, I have. 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 3 large tomatoes cut into 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 squares and now the tomato will come back 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.830
 some water let's cook 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.320
 here until almost melt the tomato 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.330
 Tomato had already got all the water and I 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.330
 I added half a red pepper 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 cut and mail green pepper now and 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.050
 only a little water 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.000
 We'll wait and see if we can dry a little. 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.490
 also when it starts to stick to the bottom 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.730
 we'll put some 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.209
 water and will also love your 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.209
 topics 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.520
 good now that it has started to change in 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.900
 future we will also add three 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.590
 water fingers 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.780
 look has reported half a glass of water 3 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.880
 tablespoons of tomato paste 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.230
 mass of tomatoes in the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.700
 normal chocolate but if you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 find better light 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.640
 and now I'm going to grind 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.830
 mix with one month 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.660
 who does not have a mix can add a 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.430
 little more water with a glass of water 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.480
 to stay warm and hit the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.440
 blender 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.440
 it's the same thing 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 after grinding or returning to the fire 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.730
 medium and I 'll put another 8 spoons 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.730
 of chocolate dough 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:52.520
 and now we are going to add two 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.780
 tablespoons vegetable stock and 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.780
 uses and Latin 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.880
 but you do not have light 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.880
 you put half the normal full talent 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.590
 we will also add a little bit of 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.580
 chili 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:29.240
 this normal black pepper a spoon 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:29.240
 of salt dessert the river 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.350
 this is pimentel powder 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.930
 look for frei captain before it 's chili 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.830
 on bad ball I put him just one 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 little just to give a little taste 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.440
 so it contained only one spoon 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.770
 and finally we'll put a little bit 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:14.990
 of parsley and natural parsley that I 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:17.210
 I chilled and a little chives 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.190
 also this is also natural chives 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.190
 that I stayed can read 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.360
 ah ah ah ah 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.150
 Now let's cook on fire. 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.879
 down for about ten minutes 10 15 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.219
 minutes and it's done, he's fine 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.099
 stubborn as you can see 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.530
 thick yields and what I do 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.719
 now divide it into several dots 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.120
 because when I need to make a 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.879
 recipe using moneo it is already 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.590
 soon and clear 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.240
 and for those who are in the second phase 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.219
 They put me but to those who are already in the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.460
 third stage you can already put there 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.460
 also 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.039
 So that's what this was today's recipe 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.560
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.080
 like that who like me is a 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.180
 recipe super easy but that is super useful 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.169
 also many people have doubts about how 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.870
 make an eye without using almost anything 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.969
 olive oil and hope you have 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.719
 liked a kiss and until the next video 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.719
 bye
