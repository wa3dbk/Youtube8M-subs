black<00:02:14.080> string<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.770> guess<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.310> a

black string so I guess this is a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
black string so I guess this is a
terrible<00:02:15.580> unviable<00:02:16.270> tactic<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:16.990> should

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
terrible unviable tactic and should

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.690 
terrible unviable tactic and should

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
never be used in a real match but I

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.350 
never be used in a real match but I
managed<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.090> survive<00:02:19.300> thanks<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.290> watching
