actually see what it actually looks like
to<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.220> reverse<00:03:24.579> but<00:03:25.510> as<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.230> said<00:03:26.410> before<00:03:26.590> this

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
to the reverse but as I said before this

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.099 
to the reverse but as I said before this
is<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.250> Schaefer<00:03:29.190> stainless<00:03:30.190> steel<00:03:31.109> recessed

is the Schaefer stainless steel recessed

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.229 
is the Schaefer stainless steel recessed
nib<00:03:32.440> I'll<00:03:32.829> just<00:03:33.040> say<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.709> 620<00:03:36.519> XG

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
nib I'll just say on the on the 620 XG

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.520 
nib I'll just say on the on the 620 XG
and<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.989> 630<00:03:38.560> these<00:03:39.489> nibs<00:03:39.849> were<00:03:40.090> actually

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and the 630 these nibs were actually

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.400 
and the 630 these nibs were actually
14-karat<00:03:41.530> gold<00:03:42.389> if<00:03:43.389> we<00:03:43.599> unscrew<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.230> barrel

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
14-karat gold if we unscrew the barrel

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.970 
14-karat gold if we unscrew the barrel
here<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:46.030> particular<00:03:46.209> pen<00:03:46.780> comes<00:03:47.200> as<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
here this particular pen comes as a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.330 
here this particular pen comes as a
cartridge<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:49.440> cartridge<00:03:50.440> fill<00:03:50.859> if<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.160> like

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
cartridge a cartridge fill if you like

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.339 
cartridge a cartridge fill if you like
and<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.579> believe<00:03:51.819> they<00:03:52.030> had<00:03:52.180> some<00:03:52.870> sort<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.260> a

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
and I believe they had some sort of a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.110 
and I believe they had some sort of a
converter<00:03:53.829> they<00:03:54.160> could<00:03:54.370> actually<00:03:54.519> use<00:03:54.790> at<00:03:54.970> its

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
converter they could actually use at its

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.830 
converter they could actually use at its
own<00:03:55.359> but<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:56.109> was<00:03:56.260> mainly<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.739> cartridge<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
own but it was mainly a cartridge and

own but it was mainly a cartridge and
cartridge<00:03:58.840> fountain<00:03:59.440> pen<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.819> if<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.209> just

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
cartridge fountain pen and if it just

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.589

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
popped them down for a moment there's

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.039 
popped them down for a moment there's
actually<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> pockets<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.709> old<00:04:07.049> script

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
actually a pockets of old script

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.759 
actually a pockets of old script
cartridges<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.389> if<00:04:10.389> we<00:04:10.720> open<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.109> up<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.349> you
