just<00:02:10.869> do<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.140> traditional<00:02:11.290> way<00:02:11.709> let's<00:02:12.160> go

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
just do the traditional way let's go

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.760 
just do the traditional way let's go
back<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.910> first<00:02:13.120> choice<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.990> just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
back to the first choice here and just

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.620 
back to the first choice here and just
start<00:02:14.980> typing<00:02:15.130> this

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
start typing this

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.020 
start typing this
is<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:18.120> test<00:02:19.120> okay<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.770> I've<00:02:21.310> got<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.520> backspace

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
is a test okay and I've got a backspace

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.540 
is a test okay and I've got a backspace
key<00:02:22.090> here<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.930> backspace<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
key here so I can backspace that out so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.430 
key here so I can backspace that out so
that's<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.940> first<00:02:25.120> way<00:02:25.390> normally<00:02:26.140> what<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.320> do

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
that's the first way normally what I do

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.980 
that's the first way normally what I do
if<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.890> don't<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> physical<00:02:27.640> keyboard<00:02:28.060> but

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
if I don't have a physical keyboard but

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.360 
if I don't have a physical keyboard but
just<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.380> show<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.980> does<00:02:30.160> do

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
just to show you that it does do

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.880 
just to show you that it does do
handwriting<00:02:30.700> recognition<00:02:30.970> let's<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.260> I'm

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
handwriting recognition let's do the I'm

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.800 
handwriting recognition let's do the I'm
going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.130> skip<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.490> thumb<00:02:33.730> keyboard<00:02:33.970> let's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
going to skip the thumb keyboard let's

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
going to skip the thumb keyboard let's
do<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.290> third<00:02:35.560> option<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.250> which<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
do the third option here which is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.510 
do the third option here which is
handwriting<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.750> if<00:02:37.930> i<00:02:38.050> print<00:02:38.620> letters<00:02:38.890> so

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
handwriting so if i print letters so

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.710 
handwriting so if i print letters so
let's<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:44.460> test<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:46.510> will

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
let's do this is a test it will

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320 
let's do this is a test it will
recognize<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:47.770> handwriting<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.940> if<00:02:49.150> that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
recognize my handwriting and if that's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.420 
recognize my handwriting and if that's
what<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.570> want<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.110> that's<00:02:50.230> correct<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.250> just

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
what I want if that's correct I can just

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.630 
what I want if that's correct I can just
simply<00:02:51.730> say<00:02:51.940> insert<00:02:52.770> press<00:02:53.770> ENTER<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.490> will

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
simply say insert press ENTER that will

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.050 
simply say insert press ENTER that will
take<00:02:54.820> me<00:02:54.850> down<00:02:55.120> another<00:02:55.450> line<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.880> let's<00:02:57.880> go

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
take me down another line and let's go

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.770 
take me down another line and let's go
out<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.950> t<00:03:00.340> EST<00:03:01.240> in<00:03:02.220> G<00:03:03.780> misspelled

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
out here and do t EST in G misspelled

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.560 
out here and do t EST in G misspelled
that<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.110> purpose<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.640> automatically<00:03:07.300> I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
that on purpose and it automatically I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.240 
that on purpose and it automatically I
was<00:03:07.840> close<00:03:08.080> enough<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.740> automatically

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
was close enough that it automatically

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.990 
was close enough that it automatically
did<00:03:09.490> auto<00:03:10.150> correct<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.260> if<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:12.370> was<00:03:12.580> not<00:03:12.790> what

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
did auto correct so if that was not what

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.670 
did auto correct so if that was not what
I<00:03:13.030> wanted<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.660> does<00:03:13.840> support<00:03:14.050> strikethrough

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
I wanted it does support strikethrough

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.440 
I wanted it does support strikethrough
so<00:03:15.220> let's<00:03:15.400> say<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.700> didn't<00:03:16.060> want<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.270> put

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
so let's say that I didn't want to put

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.630 
so let's say that I didn't want to put
the<00:03:16.570> word<00:03:16.690> testing<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:18.010> strike<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.430> out

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the word testing I can strike that out

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.490 
the word testing I can strike that out
and<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.450> say<00:03:20.250> test<00:03:22.890> okay<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:24.130> don't<00:03:25.060> want<00:03:25.240> that

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and just say test okay I don't want that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.900 
and just say test okay I don't want that
let's<00:03:26.500> see<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.710> it<00:03:26.830> will<00:03:26.920> recognize<00:03:27.400> cursive

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
let's see if it will recognize cursive

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:36.450 
let's see if it will recognize cursive
handwriting<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:33.390> test<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.400> you

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
handwriting here this is a test and you

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.000 
handwriting here this is a test and you
can<00:03:37.090> see<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.840> does<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.080> very<00:03:38.200> good<00:03:38.440> job<00:03:38.620> with

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
can see it does a very good job with

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.150 
can see it does a very good job with
that<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.370> really<00:03:39.520> does<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:41.680> good<00:03:41.800> job<00:03:41.950> of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
that it really does a pretty good job of

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.130 
that it really does a pretty good job of
recognizing<00:03:42.520> both<00:03:43.150> my<00:03:43.330> printed<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.840> in

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
recognizing both my printed in in

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.310 
recognizing both my printed in in
handwritten<00:03:44.670> letters<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.180> usually<00:03:47.080> change

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
handwritten letters so I usually change

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.080 
handwritten letters so I usually change
this<00:03:47.470> back<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.220> standard<00:03:48.670> style<00:03:48.820> keyboard

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
this back to the standard style keyboard

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.640 
this back to the standard style keyboard
because<00:03:49.510> that's<00:03:49.810> what<00:03:49.959> i<00:03:49.990> use<00:03:50.200> ninety<00:03:50.500> percent

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
because that's what i use ninety percent

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.890 
because that's what i use ninety percent
of<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> time<00:03:51.250> now<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.600> desktop

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
of the time now this is on the desktop

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.010 
of the time now this is on the desktop
site<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.560> things<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:54.520> let's<00:03:55.270> go<00:03:55.480> down<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.750> this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
site of things so let's go down to this
