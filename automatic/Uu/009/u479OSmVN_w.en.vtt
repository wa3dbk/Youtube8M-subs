in<00:02:13.930> black<00:02:14.230> ops<00:02:14.349> 2<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.459> basically<00:02:15.849> you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
in black ops 2 and so basically you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.449 
in black ops 2 and so basically you
don't<00:02:16.150> really<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.629> any<00:02:17.200> means<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:18.160> until

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
don't really have any means up until

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.729 
don't really have any means up until
your<00:02:18.580> first<00:02:18.790> UAV<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.629> know<00:02:19.959> where<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> enemies

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
your first UAV to know where the enemies

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.100 
your first UAV to know where the enemies
are<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:21.459> can't<00:02:21.700> depend<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.629> teammates<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
are you can't depend on teammates you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.320 
are you can't depend on teammates you
can't<00:02:23.290> depend<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.620> flags<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> lot

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
can't depend on flags and so what a lot

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.160 
can't depend on flags and so what a lot
of<00:02:25.540> people<00:02:25.629> do<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.800> lot<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.980> people<00:02:27.220> sort<00:02:27.519> of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
of people do and a lot of people sort of

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.130 
of people do and a lot of people sort of
accept<00:02:29.170> themselves<00:02:29.560> doing<00:02:30.249> also<00:02:30.999> is<00:02:31.239> running

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
accept themselves doing also is running

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.630 
accept themselves doing also is running
things<00:02:32.349> like<00:02:32.590> shock<00:02:32.859> charges<00:02:33.340> and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
much more passive but anyway the point

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.979 
much more passive but anyway the point
being<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.220> its<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.209> find<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.810> disappointing
