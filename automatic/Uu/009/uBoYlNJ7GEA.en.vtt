00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.439 
I've got no leaking at all little drips
coming<00:01:00.550> out<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.820> end<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:01.300> squeeze<00:01:01.720> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

creasing that dripping just a little bit
but<00:01:06.220> it's<00:01:06.940> really<00:01:07.060> not<00:01:07.300> much<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> worry<00:01:07.780> about

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
but it's really not much to worry about

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.109 
but it's really not much to worry about
I'm<00:01:08.410> not<00:01:08.470> suggesting<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.280> submerge

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
I'm not suggesting that you submerge

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.730

these<00:01:10.390> things<00:01:10.690> completely<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.290> water<00:01:11.410> but

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
these things completely in water but

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.200 
these things completely in water but
should<00:01:12.220> work<00:01:12.340> great<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.090> shower<00:01:13.710> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
should work great for the shower as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.580 
should work great for the shower as
protection<00:01:16.210> in<00:01:16.300> case<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.630> want<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.810> read<00:01:17.470> in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
protection in case you want to read in

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.620

the<00:01:17.680> bath<00:01:17.860> something<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.700> all<00:01:19.570> right

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the bath something like that all right

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.180 
the bath something like that all right
so<00:01:19.930> now<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.170> we've<00:01:20.350> ensured<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:21.009> is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
so now that we've ensured that is

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.900 
so now that we've ensured that is
relatively<00:01:22.030> watertight<00:01:23.550> take<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.580> look<00:01:24.820> at

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
relatively watertight take a look at

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.040 
relatively watertight take a look at
what<00:01:25.030> we<00:01:25.149> do<00:01:25.270> with<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.540> iPhone<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.020> just

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
what we do with the iPhone and just

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.260 
what we do with the iPhone and just
write<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.950> safety<00:01:30.399> other<00:01:30.490> side<00:01:30.700> go

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
write a safety other side go

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.150 
write a safety other side go
the<00:01:31.600> double-bagging<00:01:34.800> so<00:01:35.800> how<00:01:35.920> you're<00:01:36.130> just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
the double-bagging so how you're just

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.060 
the double-bagging so how you're just
going<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.430> place<00:01:36.700> your<00:01:37.000> device<00:01:37.800> down<00:01:38.800> in<00:01:39.009> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
going to place your device down in the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.779 
going to place your device down in the
corner<00:01:39.690> like<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.920> air<00:01:42.070> out<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.610> the

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
corner like so the air out so that the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.180 
corner like so the air out so that the
bag<00:01:43.509> can<00:01:43.780> be<00:01:43.810> flat<00:01:44.229> which<00:01:44.680> we<00:01:44.800> might<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.070> work

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
bag can be flat which we might get work

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.550 
bag can be flat which we might get work
best<00:01:45.460> for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:47.100> capacitive<00:01:48.100> touchscreen<00:01:48.670> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
best for the capacitive touchscreen and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.580 
best for the capacitive touchscreen and
for<00:01:50.560> sake<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.310> clarity<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.909> screen<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:53.439> you

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
for sake of clarity the screen when you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.429 
for sake of clarity the screen when you
can<00:01:53.799> fold<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.490> any<00:01:55.390> way<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.540> want<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:57.430> it

can fold this any way you want make it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.570 
can fold this any way you want make it
nice<00:01:59.439> and<00:01:59.470> flat<00:01:59.680> on<00:01:59.920> there<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.189> as<00:02:00.400> you'll

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
nice and flat on there and as you'll

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.999 
nice and flat on there and as you'll
notice<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.290> passive<00:02:02.290> screen<00:02:02.500> actually<00:02:02.680> it

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
notice the passive screen actually it

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.649 
notice the passive screen actually it
works<00:02:03.250> great<00:02:03.610> through<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:03.939> plastic<00:02:04.360> folder

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
works great through this plastic folder

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:18.660 
works great through this plastic folder
full<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:06.189> I'm<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.119> take<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> other<00:02:07.420> bag

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.920 

it's<00:02:19.670> gonna<00:02:19.820> be<00:02:19.970> extra<00:02:20.240> tricky<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:20.720> can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
it's gonna be extra tricky you can

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.330 
it's gonna be extra tricky you can
reverse<00:02:21.260> whether<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> zippers<00:02:21.950> are<00:02:22.100> just

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
reverse whether the zippers are just

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.280 
reverse whether the zippers are just
make<00:02:22.490> sure<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.670> don't<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.180> little<00:02:24.110> bit<00:02:24.200> of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
make sure you don't get a little bit of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.540 
make sure you don't get a little bit of
water<00:02:24.410> does<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:24.950> there's<00:02:25.190> no<00:02:25.310> chance

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
water does get in there's no chance

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.940 
water does get in there's no chance
really<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.240> can<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:27.530> down<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.770> your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
really that it can get down to your

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:37.590 
really that it can get down to your
device<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.830> squeeze<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> air<00:02:34.370> out<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.620 

now<00:02:38.600> we've<00:02:38.750> got<00:02:38.930> double<00:02:39.500> bag<00:02:40.840> very<00:02:41.890> watertight
