00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.890
 This time, mounted in even degrees 8 multi 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:12.850
 I will explain how to wear the nodal shading 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:17.260
 Mod Hatch Marichi features modal shading 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.340
 You can now set the material by concentration in the schematic view 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.950
 The 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:30.920
 This allows for more flexible setting of detailed materials 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:34.130
 Even though it is possible to set the material by concentration , it is possible to use the conventional shader tree 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.790
 The material setting is not abolished 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.750
 With material setting and hybrid by shader tree 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:48.810
 You will be able to set the material even in concentration 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.140
 Let's look at the functions added to make this setting for matialial with this concentration. 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.370
 Let's go 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 First of all, let's look at the render tab 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.430
 In the window at the lower left of the Render tab , check in the preview 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.250
 Incorporates a schematic view so you can go through the modes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.150
 is 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:15.280
 If you look at the add popup of the schematic view 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:21.580
 Two new categories of shader input shader density are added 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:27.430
 Shader input In this category there are densities for getting shading information 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 In addition, the shader density expresses various textures familiar in the shader tree 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.380
 Node has housed 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.920
 On the basis of actually these newly added farm roads in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:45.580
 Let 's set the material by concentration 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:49.420
 The sample scene is simply a ball and floor mesh 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:55.130
 The shadow of the ball is falling on the floor 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:02.270
 Let's put a halftone effect only on this shadow part 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:06.610
 First of all, the floor material Add a layer to this material custom material 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.610
 Apply halftone material from 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:18.300
 You can see that the halftone has been applied to the entire floor 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.300
 Let's change the pattern of futon a little 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:31.300
 Pattern of halftone is in the texture layer 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.300
 Because it appears in the property of this pattern alpha 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.629
 Since it has become to appear in such a feeling 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:47.300
 Only for shadows 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.060
 Putter there looks good and to apply the fur Nutter to 100% only for the portion of the shadow 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.290
 is 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.800
 Now drag this halftone material into the schematic view 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.800
 Drop 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.600
 Then shader input from additional popup 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.710
 Add the irradiation concentration here node 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.060
 Then 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.630
 The concentration of this winner 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.790
 Two nodes are added automatically : here and the shader input connected to it 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.990
 Was 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:28.410
 This is the density for acquiring shading information 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:32.440
 The winner density is the color and brightness of the shaded area 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.480
 You can get shadow information etc. 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.100
 Looking at the properties of the winner concentration 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.569
 The board is the front light here 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:53.469
 That is that to get the winner information from all of the lights on the trust 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:58.090
 If you want this to get winner information only from certain lights, 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.930
 Drag and drop to the schematic view and it is in the input part of the winner concentration 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.040
 Light 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:08.719
 It will be connected It is here and here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:13.590
 This time there is only directional light as default . 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:21.030
 Leave the concentration before light this setting 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:22.229
 This time , information on which part of the floor is in the shadow can be obtained from the winner concentration road 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.400
 By can you of 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.720
 Fight the output of the road with a pattern of halftone material 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:36.310
 Try to connect 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:41.340
 Then , only to the part where the shadow from the sphere had fallen to the floor originally 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 You can now express the effects of halftone patterns 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.910
 In this way set of Matty real itself of half-tone is carried out here of the shader tree 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:58.370
 Putter alpha of the property in it 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.370
 It becomes possible, such as performing a control at a concentration of only hand for this property
