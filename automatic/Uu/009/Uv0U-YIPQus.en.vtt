00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
go to the library all that often cuz

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.500 
go to the library all that often cuz
that's<00:04:57.860> where<00:04:57.979> people<00:04:58.070> take<00:04:58.669> showers<00:04:59.090> stop

that's where people take showers stop
it's<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.560> weird<00:05:00.800> library<00:05:01.310> really<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.610> could<00:05:01.789> do

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
it's a weird library really you could do

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.640 
it's a weird library really you could do
that<00:05:01.940> now<00:05:02.240> cuz<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:02.600> would<00:05:02.780> do<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:02.960> oh<00:05:03.320> well

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
that now cuz I would do that oh well

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.040 
that now cuz I would do that oh well
yeah<00:05:04.310> if<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.090> want<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.360> come<00:05:05.600> on<00:05:05.720> down<00:05:05.900> with

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
yeah if you want to come on down with

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.629 
yeah if you want to come on down with
the<00:05:06.110> San<00:05:06.199> Francisco<00:05:06.289> Public<00:05:06.680> very<00:05:07.160> common

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
the San Francisco Public very common

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.010 
the San Francisco Public very common
done<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:08.060> go<00:05:08.120> ahead<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.330> live<00:05:08.780> there

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
done so go ahead and live there

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.340
