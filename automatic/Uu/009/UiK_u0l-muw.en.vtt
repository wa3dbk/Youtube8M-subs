00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone will interfere with you and transfer 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.330
 easy digest 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.250
 This is the same program in which you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.030
 always get fresh and interesting 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.030
 information 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.900
 it became known that some straight tanks 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.789
 in patch 96 cheaper 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.680
 but you shouldn't be too early to rejoice 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 straight and which we now have in 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.930
 the game and only those that will be added 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.509
 amx-13 57 click on the price of seven thousand 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.100
 gold to five and an instant now Interior Ministry Charles 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.710
 11 thousand seven hundred 50 gold to 7000 450 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.860
 but Japanese premium esteshka sta-2 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.350
 now we donâ€™t have 11500 gold a7 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.390
 400 it feels like wargaming 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.950
 remembered that premium medium tanks 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.740
 stand not as heavy 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.590
 I want to believe that you have 343 also lowered 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.160
 the price is well and the last one is straight with us m56 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.220
 scorpion 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.020
 he now costs not 10,000 a7 gold but 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.060
 it is only for the reason that he is now on 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.269
 seventh level for those who ask 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.939
 question when the test is the answer is possible 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.009
 this thursday i.e. january 22 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.780
 rumor has it that the client has long been collected 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.700
 now it is tested for stability 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.649
 just recently one of the European 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.899
 Wargaming staff gave answers to 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.600
 some glitches of interest questions and 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.890
 I 'll read his world right now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 developers know that the e100 yagdpanzer 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.150
 fictional machine this is what they did 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 they consider quite normal 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.770
 therefore modify and change it no one 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.630
 going so that for those who experienced 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.760
 Now you know what with yaga and all is well 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.130
 out of the game and no one will go anywhere 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.140
 developers know that the labels are german 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.880
 pt machines are very diverse and not 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.260
 always branch goes logical but 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.150
 monotonous them to do no 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.610
 going to this branch will remain so 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.610
 how are they represented us american 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.680
 ptt 30 to the heavy tank branch nobody 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 not going to return and why 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 Generally return it there completely 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 unclear who could ever ask such 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.009
 it is also unclear, it seems, t30 is already 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.930
 suffered like tt10 qv-4 will not lose 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.790
 its capital machine gun on the tower and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.070
 this is true as our cap and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 so suffers a breakthrough of eighths and tenths 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.250
 there will be no levels yet 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.709
 pererabatyvatsya and indeed so far 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.840
 it's unclear how this will be done but done 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.480
 it will be exactly if you saw my video 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 about changing tanks when moving to hd 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.020
 modelki you us 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720
 you already know that the e100 has changed a lot 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.610
 like lukash not so mask size so in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 The whole body and of course that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.080
 developers about this strongly 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.910
 bombed the answer to this question is already in 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.860
 Reale at e100 tower was not therefore 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 developers are allowed to customize 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.230
 the tower in the game because they want to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.709
 such things are in the update 095 and go 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.050
 215b 183 was slightly changed in terms of 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 booking developers note that 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.550
 this particular booking option 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 is and capital waffle change hundred to 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.440
 12 80 meter long flags no vines 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.870
 we are going to probably ask 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.790
 why should I change waffles vista 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 but the fact is that the waffle and 100 it was 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.299
 Generally anti-aircraft gun and it was intended 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.680
 completely for another in our game and and 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.110
 presented as pt 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.930
 and in general, in principle, and clocked and tth 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.220
 completely from the air so many want 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.319
 to be replaced 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.120
 This is what kind of car and will change so far 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.709
 what is unknown but as soon as it becomes 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.019
 known from me will come out right away 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.420
 full movie about this is not 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.180
 only the waffenter sheet line have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.980
 balance problems developers are answering 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.019
 that the mark that the tiger has also 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.880
 serious balance problems 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.530
 not at all surprising for the assault 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.019
 cars because it is to machines 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.060
 is both a bombard and a tiger strain in them 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.459
 there is a good reservation and very 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.380
 heavy weapons so developers 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.450
 don't know what to do with them either 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.819
 do a separate class assault machines whether 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.370
 leave them on todays 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.440
 all hope you were interested with you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.200
 was rude thank you all for watching
