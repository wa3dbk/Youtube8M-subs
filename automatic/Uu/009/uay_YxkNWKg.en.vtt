00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.559
 I think nobody trusted me 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.860
 the island was there to open the 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.990
 framed to be one or two weeks 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 after 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.150
 I do not remember how the move was 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 but I can tell you about plays with the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 Mallorca as I chose the ball as I 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 It was like I did that as I anticipated the other 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.350
 here I am sending the message to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640
 opportunity 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.810

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.930
 because they are the good ones who always leave 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.340
