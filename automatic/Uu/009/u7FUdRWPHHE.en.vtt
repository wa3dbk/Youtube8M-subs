immediately let's sell it for 9,000

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.380 
immediately let's sell it for 9,000
and<00:02:31.080> that's<00:02:31.320> how<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.620> create<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.400> market<00:02:33.120> crash

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and that's how you create a market crash

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.650 
and that's how you create a market crash
once<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.680> very<00:02:35.130> simple<00:02:35.460> for<00:02:36.030> example<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
once it's very simple for example if you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
once it's very simple for example if you
would<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.960> like<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.530> Apple<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> store

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
would have like one Apple in the store

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.700 
would have like one Apple in the store
and<00:02:39.120> everybody<00:02:39.630> wants<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.020> Apple<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.500> store

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
and everybody wants the Apple the store

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.890 
and everybody wants the Apple the store
could<00:02:40.890> actually<00:02:41.070> ask<00:02:41.460> 10,000<00:02:42.270> coins<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
could actually ask 10,000 coins for it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
could actually ask 10,000 coins for it
or<00:02:43.140> 10,000<00:02:43.890> euros<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.250> ten<00:02:44.490> thousand<00:02:44.850> dollars

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
or 10,000 euros or ten thousand dollars

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
or 10,000 euros or ten thousand dollars
or<00:02:45.240> whatever<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.250> probably<00:02:47.250> there<00:02:47.490> will<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.760> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
or whatever and probably there will be a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.180 
or whatever and probably there will be a
rich<00:02:48.270> dude<00:02:48.570> buying<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:49.830> happens

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
rich dude buying it that's what happens

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.880 
rich dude buying it that's what happens

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that's why I'm always saying watch the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
that's why I'm always saying watch the
price<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.410> because<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.100> you're<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.460> example

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
price is because if you're for example

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.740 
price is because if you're for example
investing<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.930> certain<00:03:49.230> player<00:03:49.680> well<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
investing in one certain player well it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.360 
investing in one certain player well it
could<00:03:52.020> be<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.650> certainly<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.160> 10

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
could be that you certainly have 10

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.850 
could be that you certainly have 10
pieces<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.030> player<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:55.140> price<00:03:55.500> drops

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
pieces of the player and the price drops

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.620 
pieces of the player and the price drops
under<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.160> price<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.640> bought<00:03:56.670> them<00:03:57.060> then
