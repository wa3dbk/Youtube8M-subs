00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:13.289
 consignment are already much better 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 recently google has the cromcast 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.300
 imagined it to be such a small hdmi 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 stick that connects to the tv 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.320
 and thus various contents about wlan too 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.360
 Received apple had with the apple tv 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.640
 had such a similar product in the program 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.080
 a little bigger box which you can also get in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 tv connects and with the man 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.770
 and content such as eg from itunes received 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 but the two do not have the bill 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.420
 Made with the biggest mail order company 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.160
 namely amazon world has the amazon 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 now ev celebrates what she's into 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 riege the tv boxes line because loud 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.700
 the company are the current tv 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 box simply in your search bad or 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.420
 bad in her performance or she 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.220
 are bound an ecosystem and that wants 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.200
 Amazon and do better and bring too 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 a full hd playback with and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.020
 an interpreter 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 the included remote control is very 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 kept minimalist and brings the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.660
 most necessary box with the cool 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 but this remote is that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 you have a microphone with which you then 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.549
 also the box can control by language 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.830
 also to be able to stream movies like that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.870
 amazon instant video service supports 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 but also more third-party apps 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.990
 such as netflix or hulu but 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.490
 the focus should not only be on video 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.720
 be laid but also on games 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.470
 and there must have and well-known manufacturer 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 got into the boat like ea games sega 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 or even ubisoft and then on the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 tv box players can then 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.600
 with a smartphone with a tablet 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 or with a special one for that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.380
 developed amazon controller operated 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 become this amazon controller becomes 39 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 99 cost around to come with 1001 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 With this krantz you can relax in the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 in-house app store celebrates the purchase of games 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 ev will cost $ 99 and currently only 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.490
 a germany planned for the usa 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 Unfortunately, release is not available yet 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.570
 turn is apple on the train because loud 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 latest speculation you should 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.350
 a new version of apple tv tinker 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.150
 This should be in the next few weeks 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 to be introduced 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.600
 according to the statistic was from statista 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 every sixth uses that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 now twelve years old 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.610
 operating system windows xp the official 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.400
 support from microsoft ends however 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.930
 already with the eighth april 10 14 and 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.610
 after this date will be no further 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 security updates released 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.570
 Microsoft is therefore so gracious and wants 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.190
 all changeable with a little one 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.020
 persuade bonus to a new one 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.520
 operating system to change 100 euro 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.620
 You get discount in the microsoft store 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 if you have a service pro or service 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.060
 pro 2 buys a similar action there was 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 already in the usa the action applies 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890
 but only if the microsoft 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.070
 store with a computer on the calls 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.090
 also installed under xp 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.890
 But there are some video platforms 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 none is as successful as youtube 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 many have already tried youtube from 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.380
 thrusting it is yet none 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 succeeded a primitive of the internet 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.520
 namely yahoo supposedly now now 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 to have a new video portal in planning 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.850
 and compete with youtube 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 but not everyone should upload there 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.630
 can our existing youtube 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.790

 morschach sense or the fine out on 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.739
 the competition platform of yahoo 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.810
 Again the other question is why 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.370
 These youtube stars should be yours 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.260
