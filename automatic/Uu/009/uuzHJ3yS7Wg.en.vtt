00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.510
 today I have the lake roma of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.180
 The old hobby how to like the state 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.550
 popular the individual functions in the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.540
 video first show the city â€‹â€‹sequence 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.520
 if you want to start the head 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.770
 wear out on the start from where he 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.730
 should start 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.720
 when we first of all the sender 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.720
 then turned on the head 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.559
 the fesche and sc 10 plus of unic resp 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.329
 blade offers various possibilities 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.879
 the attitude what for example the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.300
 flight modes also affects how fast the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.210
 the agile he can fly is his head 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.949
 We have normal in the gasteig we 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 We have two flight modes 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.119
 can turn on that is mainly 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770
 once the smart mode if i'm in here 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.200
 middle position here is that of the angel 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.270
 mode and then I have the under 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.580
 high standing return roam mode the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.280
 agility of the comes that I can here 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.610
 about setting of very slow 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 acting up very fast so flying 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.009
 that they also get something action richer 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.240
 create film scenes 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:39.289
 and now I will just start 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:42.770
 43 seconds on it and how to press 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.659
 sees the rotors up high 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.159
 I do not need states with the stick 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.159
 give a little more gas 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.400
 He even stays in this height 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.830
 I would like to understand that the head 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.470
 I fly even higher 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.850
 just a little more gas should now 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.890
 in about three meters height 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.750
 after four meters this will be about 10 minutes 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.489
 just the nasty again 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.870
 neutralize if the head 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:18.700
 stay there if I'm here now 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.090
 For example, the agility of the talkers 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 Supervisor including setting and there would like 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:32.600
 I float one to the side 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 he did that very slowly, I understand 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.090
 this once again in the countries 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
 where you can see them clearly 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.950
 that the 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.159
 I start the camera by pressing a button 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.680
 you can press it once 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.079
 to film again press on it now 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.340
 I want to save the recording 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.670
 take a photo 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.909
 Impressive on this button photo 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.909
 made 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.370
 Movements of the head join in 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 photos and in the video not noticeable 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.600
 one would like to change the angle of inclination to 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.520
 for example, directly down film 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.350
 Can you use the camera lens over the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 slider to remote transmitter 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.800
 move 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.730
 bring the flight mode switch in the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.310
 high present 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.349
 returns the roma to his 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.329
 start place back 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.680
 however, this feature requires one 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.680
 existing gps signal 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.810
 with a perfect landing, the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.230
 Koma on and turns the motors themselves 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.230
 have
