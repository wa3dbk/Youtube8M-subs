00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 hey people what 's up i'm angry and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 I have two new world in this video 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.850
 beaches on the spot or one of the storm 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 xynthia but probably patched and goes 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.779
 now again that should also be 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 you go to various other buildings 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.519
 You can definitely test that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.160
 and then in the comments write at 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.460
 which buildings do we go ? 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 In any case, mega cool and indeed come 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.890
 we'll go straight to the first one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 which is located here behind the leaves 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 office building 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.530
 there you can go in there as well 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 closer inside you have to be full of fun 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 definitely cover it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 even with friends is definitely whole 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 funny testify only once even on the map 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.580
 where that is for all those 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.590
 who do not know yet where this is possible 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.739
 Office building is located or factory or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.550
 Anyway, everybody knows 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.370
 and then you go behind the building 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.500
 then the lad climbs up so runs in 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.510
 continue straight ahead and that there 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 another leader the class the authors 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 then be completely on top of that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 building 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.980
 and here you go as the second who 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 roof lookout window no idea how 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.470
 to call that and then you have it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.120
 here so 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.030
 now she needs another mission from 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.040
 zion last or gerald it really 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 Shit you start her only once 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.120
 short and if you have been in the mission ever since 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 then you can already directly with 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.020
 circle and nothing go out again and then 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 you will notice 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.790
 you are in the building at once 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.460
 that could be a little bit here 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.680
 Exploring is like him and funny 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
 Above all, the closer they are there 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.120
 Just sit at the building 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.970
 I did not think I actually thought 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.110
 that we are teachers or so but neder sits 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.540
 only three keys renÃ© vollath on each 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.030
 The case should definitely be out 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.570
 Of course, Jamaica leaves the office 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.360
 purely 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.789
 to that, imagine this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.980
 Office door and makes the same normal 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.020
 they go back to a mission 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.470
 then again directly by circle for nothing out 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 and you are already here investors office 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.310
 you can rummage through the files that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.150
 is also a laptop there you can too 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.480
 The internet is very funny and should 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.550
 You have seen it again 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 come out that works completely 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 just it's just the select 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.450
 button or just have to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.020
 your menu will open the quick start menu 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.200
 and then we go on your own 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.650
 kill 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.410
 But let's get to the next one 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.790
 has ever been that human here 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.920
 Labs building 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 I show again on the map where 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.570
 but this is definitely the one 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.450
 after hais missions everyone knows where 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.000
 that's and then you just have to 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.880
 just as stairs run at the two 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.750
 the 2 and then you run right after 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.890
 left there are such chimneys 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.290
 or whatever 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.730
 and then climbs there are both there 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.040
 so three blue pipes 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.690
 there is just between you 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.739
 eight the same again opened 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.570
 like your mission 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.340
 and when you arrived in the mission 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.739
 you just go out again and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.530
 that has been possible since the last one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.299
 in upper customers rather what that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.299
 video here yes maybe I should still 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.890
 say the money or the 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.260
 solo gate bridge and the friend out 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.900
 Cambridge is still going though 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.360
 there was an update update yesterday 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 actually in principle no innovation only 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.720
 a bit of bugs were apparently 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.370
 But I have not swept yet 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.709
 much of ge more I have to be honest 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.420
 but I'll come back to that later 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.890
 Upload video for all those who 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.330
 we just did not know it yet 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.070
 that he cares even less 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.190
 posted on my facebook page and the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.200
 title changed from the other video 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.610
 but I'll be there again later a 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 to make video and that again 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.120
 then upload I would say 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.890
 thanks for watching 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.290
 Of course you would have fallen for 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.069
 any case cool would be easier last and 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.359
 then 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.750
 I say we'll see each other next 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.750
 video people is on 23
