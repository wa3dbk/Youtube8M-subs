hello<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.130> name<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.400> Josiah<00:00:05.730> ray<00:00:06.029> I'm<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.660> to

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
hello my name is Josiah ray I'm going to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.870 
hello my name is Josiah ray I'm going to
show<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.080> how<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.350> draw<00:00:07.680> speedometer<00:00:08.429> using

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
show you how to draw speedometer using

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.020 
show you how to draw speedometer using
Java<00:00:09.440> so<00:00:10.440> here<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> am<00:00:10.740> inside<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.280> NetBeans<00:00:11.639> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Java so here I am inside of NetBeans and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.480 
Java so here I am inside of NetBeans and
this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.960> speedometer<00:00:13.410> project<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
this is my speedometer project and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
this is my speedometer project and
design<00:00:15.389> wise<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.289> form<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
design wise it's just a form with a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
design wise it's just a form with a
panel<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.029> top<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.230> panel's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
panel on top of it and the panel's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.380 
panel on top of it and the panel's
basically<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> box<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
basically just a box that I'm going to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
basically just a box that I'm going to
use<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.810> draw<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> speedometer<00:00:22.680> inside<00:00:23.010> all

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
use to draw the speedometer inside all

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
use to draw the speedometer inside all
the<00:00:24.090> real<00:00:24.300> action<00:00:24.689> happens<00:00:24.840> over<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the real action happens over here in the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.870 
the real action happens over here in the
code<00:00:26.340> panel<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
code panel so you can see right here

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.720 
code panel so you can see right here
I've<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.830> sort<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:31.980> event<00:00:32.279> listener<00:00:32.700> for

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
I've got a sort of an event listener for

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.240 
I've got a sort of an event listener for
when<00:00:33.210> somebody<00:00:33.630> clicks<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> panel<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
when somebody clicks on the panel and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
when somebody clicks on the panel and
that's<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.700> code<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> we're<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> use

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that's the code that we're going to use

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.700 
that's the code that we're going to use
to<00:00:36.780> kick<00:00:37.440> off<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.890> drawing<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.290> very

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to kick off this drawing it's not very

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 
to kick off this drawing it's not very
complicated<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.600> mostly

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
complicated as you can see it's mostly

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.100 
complicated as you can see it's mostly
just<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.940> draw<00:00:44.940> commands<00:00:45.420> preceded<00:00:46.079> by

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
just a lot of draw commands preceded by

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
just a lot of draw commands preceded by
color<00:00:46.950> changes<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.700> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> mix<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
color changes to kind of mix things up a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139 
color changes to kind of mix things up a
little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> first<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.030> do

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
little bit so the first thing that we do

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.799 
little bit so the first thing that we do
is<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.420> define<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.430> graphics<00:00:53.430> variable<00:00:53.910> G<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
is we define the graphics variable G and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.040 
is we define the graphics variable G and
I'm<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.800> setting<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.239> panel<00:00:57.719> which

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
I'm just setting that to the panel which

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.189 
I'm just setting that to the panel which
I<00:00:58.170> left<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> default<00:00:58.949> name<00:00:59.100> J<00:00:59.340> panel<00:01:00.199> dot

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I left as the default name J panel dot

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
I left as the default name J panel dot
get<00:01:01.649> graphics<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> command<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
get graphics and that's the command to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
get graphics and that's the command to
get<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> graphics<00:01:04.680> variable<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> panel

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
get the graphics variable of the panel

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.550 
get the graphics variable of the panel
and<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.450> setting<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> over<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.380> own

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and I'm setting it over to my own

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
and I'm setting it over to my own
variable<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.850> whenever<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
variable so that I can use it whenever I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
variable so that I can use it whenever I
want<00:01:09.390> instead<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.960> having<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.350> write<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
want instead of having to write that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
want instead of having to write that
whole<00:01:11.310> long<00:01:11.549> line<00:01:11.820> out<00:01:12.000> every<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> first

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
whole long line out every time so first

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.179 
whole long line out every time so first
what<00:01:14.970> we're<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.149 
what we're going to do is we're going to
fill<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.430> art<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.170> basically<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
fill this art which is basically the the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.740 
fill this art which is basically the the
backlight<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> dial<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:23.750> these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
backlight of the dial and these

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.499 
backlight of the dial and these
coordinates<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:27.049> just<00:01:28.049> relating<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> where

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
coordinates are just relating to where

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.420 
coordinates are just relating to where
you're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> start<00:01:31.200> where<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> center

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
you're going to start where the center

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're going to start where the center
of<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.790> arc<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.960> arc<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of this little arc is and an arc is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
of this little arc is and an arc is
basically<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.829> circle<00:01:35.220> that's<00:01:35.909> been<00:01:36.119> cut<00:01:36.299> into

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
basically a circle that's been cut into

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
basically a circle that's been cut into
a<00:01:36.479> pie<00:01:36.659> slice<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.250> where<00:01:38.939> you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
a pie slice and so this is where you're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
a pie slice and so this is where you're
going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> start<00:01:39.540> drawing<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> circle<00:01:40.409> how

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
going to start drawing the circle how

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
going to start drawing the circle how
big<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> radius<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> circle<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.840> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
big the radius of the circle is going to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
big the radius of the circle is going to
be<00:01:43.140> both<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.740> height<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> width<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
be both the height and the width and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450 
be both the height and the width and
then<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.560> extra<00:01:46.950> parameters

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then it's got actually extra parameters

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.389 
then it's got actually extra parameters
for<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> 0<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> 180<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.310> I'm

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
for you can see is 0 and 180 so I'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
for you can see is 0 and 180 so I'm
going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> start<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.030> angle<00:01:51.329> 0<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going to start at angle 0 and go all the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
going to start at angle 0 and go all the
way<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.130> 180<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> draw

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
way over to 180 and it's going to draw

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.490 
way over to 180 and it's going to draw
for<00:01:55.049> me<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.270> little<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.840> basically<00:01:58.200> half<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
for me this little the basically half a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
for me this little the basically half a
pie<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> fill<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
pie and then it's going to fill it with

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.499 
pie and then it's going to fill it with
the<00:02:00.780> color<00:02:00.899> white<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.619> I've<00:02:01.799> specified<00:02:02.509> G

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the color white because I've specified G

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.730 
the color white because I've specified G
set<00:02:03.990> color<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.500> white<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.290> that's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
set color as white so that's the that's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
set color as white so that's the that's
pretty<00:02:08.099> simple<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> first<00:02:08.879> command<00:02:09.239> then

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
pretty simple as the first command then

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.910 
pretty simple as the first command then
what<00:02:10.259> we're<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.890> is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
what we're going to do is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.979 
what we're going to do is
draw<00:02:13.920> another<00:02:14.159> arc<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.670> black<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.930> is

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
draw another arc in black and this is

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.740 
draw another arc in black and this is
just<00:02:16.409> kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.709> aesthetics<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:18.269> draw<00:02:18.480> an<00:02:18.569> arc

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
just kind of aesthetics we draw an arc

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.360 
just kind of aesthetics we draw an arc
and<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.019> line<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.799> you'll<00:02:20.069> notice

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
and then a line and it's you'll notice

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
and then a line and it's you'll notice
that<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.640> exactly<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.329> same<00:02:21.540> size<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:22.049> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
that it's exactly the same size as the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.009 
that it's exactly the same size as the
white<00:02:22.439> arc<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.299> line<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.659> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.930> be

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
white arc and the line is going to be

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.420 
white arc and the line is going to be
right<00:02:25.319> along<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> bottom<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.189> just

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
right along the bottom and that just

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.429 
right along the bottom and that just
kind<00:02:26.579> of<00:02:26.670> outlines<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.599> speedometer<00:02:28.170> dial

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
kind of outlines your speedometer dial

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.770 
kind of outlines your speedometer dial
you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.159> have<00:02:29.909> that<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.239> don't<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you can have that or don't have that I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.059 
you can have that or don't have that I
kind<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> look<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:34.069> draw

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
kind of like the look of it this draw

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.410 
kind of like the look of it this draw
line<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:36.060> red<00:02:36.689> is<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.739> speedometer

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
line here in red is the speedometer

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.610 
line here in red is the speedometer
indicator<00:02:39.420> where<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.870> pointing<00:02:40.409> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
indicator where it's pointing and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.649 
indicator where it's pointing and
there's<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.519> couple<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.909> different<00:02:42.299> commands

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
there's a couple of different commands

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.420 
there's a couple of different commands
and<00:02:42.840> they're<00:02:42.930> almost<00:02:43.290> exactly<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.189> same<00:02:44.219> but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and they're almost exactly the same but

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.160 
and they're almost exactly the same but
you<00:02:44.670> notice<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.030> coordinates<00:02:45.540> changed<00:02:46.019> by

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you notice the coordinates changed by

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.539 
you notice the coordinates changed by
one<00:02:46.980> pixel<00:02:47.659> usually<00:02:48.659> along<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> x-axis<00:02:50.040> so

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
one pixel usually along the x-axis so

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.360 
one pixel usually along the x-axis so
the<00:02:51.000> starting<00:02:51.480> X<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> ending<00:02:52.889> X<00:02:53.099> all

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the starting X and the ending X all

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.539 
the starting X and the ending X all
increment<00:02:54.299> by<00:02:54.510> one<00:02:54.720> pixel<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.310> reason

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
increment by one pixel and the reason

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.979 
increment by one pixel and the reason
for<00:02:56.669> that<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.970> there's<00:02:57.180> no<00:02:57.299> really<00:02:57.540> easy<00:02:57.720> way

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for that is there's no really easy way

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.589 
for that is there's no really easy way
to<00:02:58.049> change<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.560> thickness<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.220> line<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.209> I'm

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
to change the thickness of a line so I'm

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.080 
to change the thickness of a line so I'm
drawing<00:03:01.079> several<00:03:01.620> lines<00:03:01.829> right<00:03:02.549> next<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.970> each

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
drawing several lines right next to each

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.550 
drawing several lines right next to each
other<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.689> pixel<00:03:04.139> of<00:03:04.430> apart<00:03:05.430> basically

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
other one pixel of apart basically

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.990 
other one pixel of apart basically
manually<00:03:07.560> changing<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.310> thickness<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.849> that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
manually changing the thickness of that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.250 
manually changing the thickness of that
line<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.299> leave<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.629> as<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:12.810> draw

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
line so you can leave it as one draw

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.720 
line so you can leave it as one draw
commander<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:13.889> have<00:03:14.010> several<00:03:14.280> depending

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
commander you can have several depending

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.759 
commander you can have several depending
on<00:03:14.849> on<00:03:15.060> your<00:03:15.569> taste<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.349> aesthetic

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
on on your taste and aesthetic

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.550 
on on your taste and aesthetic
preferences<00:03:17.479> this<00:03:18.479> is<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.900> hard<00:03:19.139> part<00:03:19.349> down

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
preferences this is the hard part down

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.430 
preferences this is the hard part down
here<00:03:19.829> though<00:03:20.299> there<00:03:21.299> really<00:03:21.510> isn't<00:03:21.750> any<00:03:22.139> easy

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
here though there really isn't any easy

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.640 
here though there really isn't any easy
way<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.859> draw<00:03:23.340> numbers<00:03:23.879> around<00:03:24.840> an<00:03:25.079> arc<00:03:25.379> you

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
way to draw numbers around an arc you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.229 
way to draw numbers around an arc you
kind<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.129> have<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.489> play<00:03:26.760> around<00:03:26.940> with

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
kind of have to play around with

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.550 
kind of have to play around with
different<00:03:27.599> values<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.079> see<00:03:28.260> how<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:28.530> looks

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
different values and see how it looks

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.559 
different values and see how it looks
and<00:03:28.949> move<00:03:29.069> them<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.400> forth<00:03:29.609> but<00:03:30.449> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
and move them back and forth but the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.069 
and move them back and forth but the
command<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.280> G<00:03:32.280> draw<00:03:32.790> string<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.419> so<00:03:33.959> you're

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
command is G draw string and so you're

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.449 
command is G draw string and so you're
going<00:03:34.199> to<00:03:34.290> give<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.620> text<00:03:34.919> you<00:03:35.010> want<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> draw

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
going to give it a text you want to draw

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.099 
going to give it a text you want to draw
and<00:03:35.699> then<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.030> x<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.389> y<00:03:36.479> coordinates<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
and then the x and y coordinates of

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.530 
and then the x and y coordinates of
where<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.349> want<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> put<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.359> kind

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
where you want to put it and I just kind

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.030 
where you want to put it and I just kind
of<00:03:39.569> experimented<00:03:40.229> these<00:03:40.409> are<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.709> values

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
of experimented these are the values

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.819 
of experimented these are the values
that<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> got<00:03:41.519> based<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.449> the<00:03:43.019> position<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.650> my

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
that I got based on the position of my

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.059 
that I got based on the position of my
arc<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.340> my<00:03:45.209> speedometer<00:03:45.870> dial<00:03:46.440> inside<00:03:46.949> the

arc or my speedometer dial inside the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.189 
arc or my speedometer dial inside the
panel<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.400> drawing<00:03:47.729> and<00:03:47.940> how<00:03:48.449> big<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:48.930> all

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
panel I'm drawing and how big it is all

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.530 
panel I'm drawing and how big it is all
of<00:03:49.319> that<00:03:49.470> stuff<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.729> just<00:03:50.760> began

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
of that stuff and I just began

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.149 
of that stuff and I just began
experimenting<00:03:51.959> with<00:03:52.379> different<00:03:52.680> values<00:03:52.979> and

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
experimenting with different values and

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.129 
experimenting with different values and
this<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.459> kind<00:03:53.729> of<00:03:53.879> what<00:03:54.419> I<00:03:54.449> found<00:03:54.720> worked

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
this is kind of what I found worked

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.099 
this is kind of what I found worked
fairly<00:03:55.739> well<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.180> run<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.750> we<00:03:57.959> can

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
fairly well so if we run this we can

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.080 
fairly well so if we run this we can
kind<00:03:58.349> of<00:03:58.439> see<00:03:58.709> what<00:03:59.370> our<00:03:59.489> speedometer<00:04:00.030> is

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
kind of see what our speedometer is

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.439 
kind of see what our speedometer is
going<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.359> look<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:03.859> and<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:06.060> doesn't<00:04:06.090> look

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
going to look like and it doesn't look

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.300 
going to look like and it doesn't look
like<00:04:06.599> anything<00:04:06.930> yet<00:04:07.290> because<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:07.829> you

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
like anything yet because as you

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.009 
like anything yet because as you
remember<00:04:08.729> we<00:04:08.909> have<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.269> click<00:04:09.569> event<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
remember we have that click event to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.809 
remember we have that click event to
kick<00:04:10.470> off<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> drawing<00:04:11.009> so<00:04:11.579> I'm<00:04:11.639> going<00:04:11.790> to

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
kick off the drawing so I'm going to

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.960 
kick off the drawing so I'm going to
click<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.329> middle<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:13.970> there's

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
click right in the middle and there's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.629 
click right in the middle and there's
our<00:04:15.150> speedometer<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.530> outlined<00:04:17.430> with

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
our speedometer and it's outlined with

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.789 
our speedometer and it's outlined with
the<00:04:17.759> black<00:04:17.970> lines<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.599> it's<00:04:19.169> got<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.470> numbers

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
the black lines and it's got the numbers

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.339 
the black lines and it's got the numbers
drawn<00:04:20.039> on<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.280> as<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:21.000> quick<00:04:21.359> side<00:04:21.659> note<00:04:21.719> if<00:04:22.109> you

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
drawn on it as a quick side note if you

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.540 
drawn on it as a quick side note if you
put<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.950> outline<00:04:23.580> commands

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
put the outline commands

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.939 
put the outline commands
before<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.419> fill<00:04:25.629> command<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.500> won't<00:04:26.680> see

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
before the fill command you won't see

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.159 
before the fill command you won't see
them<00:04:27.099> because<00:04:27.819> that<00:04:27.970> arc<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.389> same<00:04:28.780> size

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
them because that arc is the same size

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.529 
them because that arc is the same size
and<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.520> going<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.849> cover<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
and so it's going to cover up the

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.779 
and so it's going to cover up the
outline<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.169> it's<00:04:32.800> important<00:04:33.159> to<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.370> your

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
outline so it's important to have your

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.040 
outline so it's important to have your
your<00:04:34.150> fills<00:04:34.720> before<00:04:35.710> your<00:04:35.860> outlines<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:37.419> this

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
your fills before your outlines so this

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.339 
your fills before your outlines so this
is<00:04:38.229> our<00:04:38.409> extra<00:04:39.370> thick<00:04:39.699> indicator<00:04:40.509> pointing

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
is our extra thick indicator pointing

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.529 
is our extra thick indicator pointing
toward<00:04:41.680> probably<00:04:42.280> about<00:04:42.490> 19<00:04:43.000> miles<00:04:43.180> an<00:04:43.389> hour

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
toward probably about 19 miles an hour

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.420 
toward probably about 19 miles an hour
or<00:04:43.930> kilometers<00:04:43.990> per<00:04:44.590> an<00:04:44.680> hour<00:04:44.770> which<00:04:45.099> either

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
or kilometers per an hour which either

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.850 
or kilometers per an hour which either
way<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.639> pretty<00:04:45.819> slow<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.409> all<00:04:47.409> the<00:04:47.530> numbers

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
way is pretty slow and all the numbers

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.189 
way is pretty slow and all the numbers
arranged<00:04:48.789> basically<00:04:49.419> around<00:04:49.690> in<00:04:49.900> an<00:04:49.990> arc

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
arranged basically around in an arc

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.309 
arranged basically around in an arc
colored<00:04:50.919> blue<00:04:51.900> I've<00:04:52.900> done<00:04:53.139> some

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
colored blue I've done some

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.499 
colored blue I've done some
experimenting<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.280> can<00:04:54.490> replace<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
experimenting and you can replace the

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.580 
experimenting and you can replace the
line<00:04:55.780> with<00:04:56.259> another<00:04:56.830> arc<00:04:57.099> and<00:04:58.259> program<00:04:59.259> its

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
line with another arc and program its

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.450 
line with another arc and program its
angle<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:01.150> respond<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:02.080> user<00:05:02.380> input<00:05:02.650> so<00:05:03.220> that

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
angle to respond to user input so that

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.180 
angle to respond to user input so that
would<00:05:03.880> be<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> way<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.270> program<00:05:04.960> this<00:05:05.650> kind<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.159> a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
would be a way to program this kind of a

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.899 
would be a way to program this kind of a
speedometer<00:05:06.940> for<00:05:07.599> a<00:05:07.930> game<00:05:08.500> where<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.639> car<00:05:09.819> is

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
speedometer for a game where the car is

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.159 
speedometer for a game where the car is
accelerating<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:10.870> want<00:05:11.050> the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
accelerating and you want the

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.589 
accelerating and you want the
speedometer<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.830> reflect<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.490> but<00:05:13.389> right

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
speedometer to reflect that but right

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.149 
speedometer to reflect that but right
