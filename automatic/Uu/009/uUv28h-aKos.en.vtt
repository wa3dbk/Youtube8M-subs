00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
just start rolling in and pretty soon

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.100 
just start rolling in and pretty soon
you'll<00:01:48.830> see<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.369> bone<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:51.710> come<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.100> life

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
fingerprints on it after you bake it you

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.450 
fingerprints on it after you bake it you
can<00:01:58.070> just<00:01:58.100> easily<00:01:58.610> sand<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.330> off<00:01:59.619> and<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:01.250> like

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
can just easily sand it off and I like

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.890 
can just easily sand it off and I like
when<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:01.939> little<00:02:02.090> bit<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:02.659> got<00:02:02.840> a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
when I get a little bit of it I got a

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.960 
when I get a little bit of it I got a
little<00:02:02.960> bit<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.530> black<00:02:03.770> paper<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.400> here<00:02:04.759> and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
little bit of a black paper in here and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.149 
little bit of a black paper in here and
it<00:02:05.750> actually<00:02:05.930> kind<00:02:06.229> of<00:02:06.320> looks<00:02:06.500> neat<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:06.830> it

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
it actually kind of looks neat and it

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.639 
it actually kind of looks neat and it
looks<00:02:07.310> more<00:02:07.549> realistic<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.570> not<00:02:09.229> everybody

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
looks more realistic but not everybody

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
looks more realistic but not everybody
likes<00:02:09.890> realistic<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.759> guess<00:02:10.970> they<00:02:11.209> just<00:02:11.239> like

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540
