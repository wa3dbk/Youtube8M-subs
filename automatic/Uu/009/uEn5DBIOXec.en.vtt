00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.589
 how to install the optimal mode in 1.4 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.480
 points 5 vouchers that is to decrease the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.599
 current we have are called graph to the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.299
 time to record is worth making 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.920
 where error first we go to the link that you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.800
 I left in the description of the video 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.020
 ok we go down and talk about ultra social 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.810
 standard online dairy for computers

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.140
 powerful and ultra medium computers is already 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.890
 for powerful computers we are going to double 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.450
 in our case I chose subscription here 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.880
 we have to wait for these seconds 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.880
 and then we give you jump advertising 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.310
 here we are going to bend optics in 1.4 point 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.910
 5 that in the middle 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.410
 if you download us 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.410
 we open it with you find 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 and this we leave here after we go to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.780
 this controlled 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620
 but we close 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.960
 suppress yes 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.979
 now the optimal that we have downloaded 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.450
 we copy two files worth all of us 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.970
 we drag to the folder that 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.260

 let's escape 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.790
 vision field options this what 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.659
 we put 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.659
