00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:06.439 
I'm just Nick and today we're gonna mess

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.700 
I'm just Nick and today we're gonna mess
around<00:00:06.700> with<00:00:07.700> the<00:00:08.029> boomerang<00:00:08.629> three<00:00:09.200> looper

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
around with the boomerang three looper

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.890 
around with the boomerang three looper
pedal<00:00:09.740> I'm<00:00:10.639> going<00:00:11.090> to<00:00:11.180> go<00:00:11.299> right<00:00:11.660> to

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
pedal I'm going to go right to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.049 
pedal I'm going to go right to
demonstrating<00:00:12.590> it<00:00:12.709> but<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:13.219> promise<00:00:13.639> you<00:00:13.789> I'm

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
demonstrating it but I promise you I'm

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.060 
demonstrating it but I promise you I'm
not<00:00:14.119> just<00:00:14.510> wanking<00:00:14.930> there's<00:00:15.500> a<00:00:15.590> point<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:15.920> what

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
not just wanking there's a point to what

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.550 
not just wanking there's a point to what
I'm<00:00:16.190> playing<00:00:16.369> okay<00:00:17.300> I<00:00:17.330> am<00:00:17.600> just<00:00:17.810> linking<00:00:18.199> but

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
I'm playing okay I am just linking but

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.960 
I'm playing okay I am just linking but
there's<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:18.800> point<00:00:18.980> in<00:00:19.190> my<00:00:19.220> wanking<00:00:19.699> how<00:00:19.820> about

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
there's a point in my wanking how about

00:00:19.970 --> 00:02:26.869 
there's a point in my wanking how about
that

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.530 

and<00:02:28.109> so<00:02:29.109> on<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.980> forth<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:31.269> was<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and so on and so forth what was the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.089 
and so on and so forth what was the
friggin<00:02:31.840> point<00:02:32.049> of<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.590> slightly

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
friggin point of that slightly

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.599 
friggin point of that slightly
half-assed<00:02:33.489> version<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:34.120> creep<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.340> point

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
half-assed version of creep the point

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.920 
half-assed version of creep the point
was<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.139> looper<00:02:38.650> doesn't<00:02:39.579> just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
was this that this looper doesn't just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370 
was this that this looper doesn't just
record<00:02:40.930> one<00:02:41.200> loop<00:02:41.440> at<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.130> time<00:02:43.079> record<00:02:44.079> in<00:02:44.170> play

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
record one loop at a time record in play

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.270 
record one loop at a time record in play
or<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:46.120> loops<00:02:46.389> at<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.660> time<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:47.349> even<00:02:47.680> three

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
or two loops at a time or even three

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.580 
or two loops at a time or even three
loops<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.359> record<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.049> play<00:02:50.079> back<00:02:50.410> up

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
loops but it can record and play back up

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
loops but it can record and play back up
to<00:02:51.099> four<00:02:51.430> loops<00:02:51.669> at<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.880> time<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.299> right<00:02:52.930> there

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
to four loops at a time and right there

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.870 
to four loops at a time and right there
we<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.620> used<00:02:53.859> two<00:02:54.099> separate<00:02:54.459> loops<00:02:54.579> now

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
we just used two separate loops now

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.180 
we just used two separate loops now
what's<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.959> possible<00:02:56.470> advantage<00:02:56.889> of<00:02:57.010> such<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
what's the possible advantage of such a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.599 
what's the possible advantage of such a
thing

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
thing

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.740 
thing
well<00:02:58.889> for<00:02:59.889> me<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.519> main<00:03:00.700> advantage<00:03:01.180> would<00:03:01.569> be

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
well for me the main advantage would be

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.710 
well for me the main advantage would be
in<00:03:01.989> live<00:03:02.410> performance<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:04.359> it<00:03:04.450> allows

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
in live performance is that it allows

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.789 
in live performance is that it allows
you<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.079> create<00:03:05.290> maybe<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.519> one<00:03:06.970> bar<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:08.109> sort<00:03:08.739> of

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
you to create maybe a one bar a sort of

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.280 
you to create maybe a one bar a sort of
rhythmic<00:03:09.310> pattern<00:03:09.910> or<00:03:10.419> beat<00:03:10.690> type<00:03:10.959> pattern

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
rhythmic pattern or beat type pattern

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.039 
rhythmic pattern or beat type pattern
like<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.590> did<00:03:11.799> there<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.359> then<00:03:13.359> play<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> whole

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
like I did there and then play a whole

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.809 
like I did there and then play a whole
damn<00:03:14.230> song<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.799> another<00:03:15.040> loop<00:03:15.250> over<00:03:15.669> that

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
damn song on another loop over that

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.690 
damn song on another loop over that
pattern<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:17.680> makes<00:03:17.919> this<00:03:18.099> fairly<00:03:18.370> easy

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
pattern and it makes this fairly easy

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.449 
pattern and it makes this fairly easy
because<00:03:19.599> this<00:03:19.900> particular<00:03:20.109> looper<00:03:20.859> when<00:03:21.340> you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
because this particular looper when you

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.339 
because this particular looper when you
kick<00:03:22.090> on<00:03:22.299> record<00:03:22.989> for<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.769> next<00:03:24.040> loop

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
kick on record for that next loop

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.569 
kick on record for that next loop
sorry<00:03:26.349> Street<00:03:26.680> noise<00:03:26.859> don't<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.220> hate<00:03:27.310> street

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
sorry Street noise don't you hate street

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.039 
sorry Street noise don't you hate street
noise<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:28.030> people's<00:03:28.329> stupid<00:03:28.629> demos<00:03:28.930> why

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
noise on people's stupid demos why

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.390 
noise on people's stupid demos why
didn't<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.290> close<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.590> window<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:30.340> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
didn't I close the window it's a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430 
didn't I close the window it's a
beautiful<00:03:30.760> day<00:03:30.940> with<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.389> air<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.629> come<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.810> so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
beautiful day with the air to come in so

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.110 
beautiful day with the air to come in so
when<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.680> kick<00:03:32.859> on<00:03:33.010> record<00:03:33.430> for<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.730> second

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
when you kick on record for that second

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.240 
when you kick on record for that second
loop<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.930> actually<00:03:35.200> doesn't<00:03:35.379> start<00:03:35.709> recording

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
loop it actually doesn't start recording

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.460 
loop it actually doesn't start recording
until<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:37.120> get<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.510> downbeat<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.079> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
until you get to the downbeat of the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.879 
until you get to the downbeat of the
first<00:03:38.680> loop<00:03:38.919> so<00:03:39.699> it's<00:03:40.090> real<00:03:41.049> easy<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.650> know

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
first loop so it's real easy you know

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.499 
first loop so it's real easy you know
you<00:03:41.949> don't<00:03:42.100> have<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.370> do<00:03:42.489> any<00:03:42.669> fancy<00:03:42.940> footwork

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:43.509 
you don't have to do any fancy footwork

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:44.400 
you don't have to do any fancy footwork
or<00:03:43.840> nail<00:03:44.109> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
or nail the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.250 
or nail the
switch<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.890> exactly<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.820> right<00:03:45.970> time

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
switch it exactly the right time

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.710 
switch it exactly the right time
basically<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.680> loop<00:03:47.920> started

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
basically you get that loop started

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.390 
basically you get that loop started
going<00:03:49.720> rhythmically<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.890> click<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
going rhythmically you click on the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
going rhythmically you click on the
other<00:03:51.520> one<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.090> just<00:03:52.420> come<00:03:52.600> in<00:03:52.720> on<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
other one and you just come in on the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.380 
other one and you just come in on the
downbeat<00:03:53.320> where<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.530> feel<00:03:53.770> it<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.120> it

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
downbeat where you feel it and it

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.260 
downbeat where you feel it and it
records<00:03:55.660> beautifully<00:03:56.790> very<00:03:57.790> very<00:03:58.090> useful

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
records beautifully very very useful

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.480 
records beautifully very very useful
because<00:03:59.230> with<00:03:59.710> a<00:03:59.740> looper<00:04:00.100> that's<00:04:00.280> only

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
because with a looper that's only

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.340 
because with a looper that's only
playing<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:00.940> loop<00:04:01.210> yes<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.020> stack<00:04:02.320> your

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
playing one loop yes you can stack your

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.160 
playing one loop yes you can stack your
rhythmic<00:04:02.950> part<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.640> your<00:04:04.270> harmonic<00:04:05.050> and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
rhythmic part with your harmonic and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.490 
rhythmic part with your harmonic and
melodic<00:04:05.290> parts<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.480> have<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.110> play<00:04:08.320> that

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
melodic parts but you have to play that

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.740 
melodic parts but you have to play that
rhythmic<00:04:08.890> part<00:04:09.130> for<00:04:09.340> however<00:04:09.730> long<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.390> period

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
rhythmic part for however long a period

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.200 
rhythmic part for however long a period
of<00:04:11.020> time<00:04:11.560> or<00:04:11.620> however<00:04:11.980> many<00:04:12.250> bars<00:04:12.580> as<00:04:12.940> the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
of time or however many bars as the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.270 
of time or however many bars as the
other<00:04:13.360> parts<00:04:13.660> are<00:04:13.780> gonna<00:04:13.870> be<00:04:14.080> otherwise<00:04:15.010> you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
other parts are gonna be otherwise you

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.710 
other parts are gonna be otherwise you
won't<00:04:15.430> have<00:04:15.550> room<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:16.239> play<00:04:16.390> those<00:04:16.540> other

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
won't have room to play those other

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.690 
won't have room to play those other
parts<00:04:17.080> so<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.650> get<00:04:17.830> to<00:04:17.980> loop<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.280> beat<00:04:18.489> and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
parts so here you get to loop a beat and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.270 
parts so here you get to loop a beat and
then<00:04:18.760> play<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> whole<00:04:19.720> damn<00:04:19.900> song<00:04:20.170> pretty<00:04:21.040> cool

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
then play a whole damn song pretty cool

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.860 
then play a whole damn song pretty cool
of<00:04:21.730> course<00:04:21.820> there<00:04:22.180> are<00:04:22.210> other<00:04:22.330> loopers<00:04:22.720> that

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
of course there are other loopers that

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.330 
of course there are other loopers that
can<00:04:22.990> do<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.470> they<00:04:23.620> tend<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.920> be<00:04:24.040> larger

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
can do this but they tend to be larger

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.370 
can do this but they tend to be larger
this<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> pretty<00:04:27.880> small<00:04:28.030> format<00:04:28.690> looper<00:04:29.080> and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
this is a pretty small format looper and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.130 
this is a pretty small format looper and
I<00:04:29.950> think<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.990> important<00:04:31.990> thing<00:04:32.020> to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
I think that the important thing to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.720 
I think that the important thing to
recognize<00:04:32.380> about<00:04:32.650> this<00:04:33.010> looper<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.610> it

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
recognize about this looper because it

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.850 
recognize about this looper because it
does<00:04:33.970> lack<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.390> lot<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.840> features<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.530> current

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
does lack a lot of features of current

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.350 
does lack a lot of features of current
loopers<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.310> are<00:04:36.400> out<00:04:36.520> there<00:04:36.550> namely<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
loopers that are out there namely the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.900 
loopers that are out there namely the
ability<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.720> store<00:04:38.110> loops<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.590> an<00:04:38.680> SD<00:04:38.830> card<00:04:39.250> you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
ability to store loops on an SD card you

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.050 
ability to store loops on an SD card you
know<00:04:40.000> take<00:04:40.240> them<00:04:40.390> off<00:04:40.540> via<00:04:40.930> USB<00:04:41.350> whatever<00:04:42.060> is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
know take them off via USB whatever is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.600 
know take them off via USB whatever is
that<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.540> looper<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.590> very<00:04:45.130> good<00:04:45.310> looper

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that this looper is a very good looper

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.910 
that this looper is a very good looper
for<00:04:45.820> live<00:04:46.060> performance<00:04:46.720> partly<00:04:47.590> because<00:04:47.770> that

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
for live performance partly because that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.040 
for live performance partly because that
multiple<00:04:48.310> loop<00:04:48.550> ability<00:04:49.180> but<00:04:49.420> also<00:04:49.480> because

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
multiple loop ability but also because

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.540 
multiple loop ability but also because
it's<00:04:50.230> got<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.380> whole<00:04:50.530> lot<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.740> switches<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.310> top

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
it's got a whole lot of switches on top

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.450 
it's got a whole lot of switches on top
of<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:52.020> which<00:04:53.020> means<00:04:53.200> that<00:04:53.530> pretty<00:04:54.040> much<00:04:54.220> all

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
of it which means that pretty much all

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.640 
of it which means that pretty much all
the<00:04:54.730> features<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.300> be<00:04:55.450> reached<00:04:55.720> with<00:04:56.080> just

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
the features can be reached with just

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.470 
the features can be reached with just
one<00:04:56.890> button<00:04:57.160> press<00:04:57.400> or<00:04:57.730> maybe<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.120> little<00:04:58.240> knob

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
one button press or maybe a little knob

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.330 
one button press or maybe a little knob
twist<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.080> button<00:04:59.320> press<00:04:59.470> and<00:04:59.770> there's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
twist and a button press and there's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.159 
twist and a button press and there's
flexibility<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.060> assigning<00:05:01.780> some<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.080> these

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
flexibility in assigning some of these

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.290 
flexibility in assigning some of these
features<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.919> two<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.790> buttons

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
features to two of the buttons

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.590 
features to two of the buttons
here's<00:05:04.720> your<00:05:04.930> multiple<00:05:05.260> loop<00:05:05.440> buttons<00:05:06.600> you

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
here's your multiple loop buttons you

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.180 
here's your multiple loop buttons you
can<00:05:07.780> set<00:05:07.960> separate<00:05:08.320> volumes<00:05:08.740> for<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:08.980> loops

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
can set separate volumes for the loops

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.630 
can set separate volumes for the loops
you<00:05:09.520> can<00:05:10.060> set<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.390> fade<00:05:10.690> time<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.380> assign<00:05:12.160> fade

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
you can set a fade time and assign fade

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.190 
you can set a fade time and assign fade
out<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:13.090> one<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.330> these<00:05:13.450> buttons<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.900> know<00:05:14.080> all

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
out to one of these buttons you know all

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.990 
out to one of these buttons you know all
of<00:05:14.230> these<00:05:14.380> are<00:05:14.650> kind<00:05:14.919> of<00:05:15.040> common<00:05:15.460> features<00:05:15.790> on

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
of these are kind of common features on

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.690 
of these are kind of common features on
bloopers<00:05:16.419> a<00:05:16.600> couple<00:05:17.200> things<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:18.550> might

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
bloopers a couple things that you might

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.880 
bloopers a couple things that you might
not<00:05:18.850> find<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.240> other<00:05:19.360> loopers<00:05:19.810> on<00:05:20.110> this<00:05:20.530> looper

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
not find on other loopers on this looper

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.140 
not find on other loopers on this looper
not<00:05:21.070> only<00:05:21.310> do<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.550> have<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.760> ability<00:05:22.120> to

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
not only do you have the ability to

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.120 
not only do you have the ability to
reverse<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.020> loop<00:05:23.200> at<00:05:23.410> any<00:05:23.560> time<00:05:23.800> with<00:05:24.040> a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
reverse the loop at any time with a

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.490 
reverse the loop at any time with a
single<00:05:24.280> button<00:05:24.580> push<00:05:25.050> which<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.169> can<00:05:26.290> do<00:05:26.350> on<00:05:26.380> a

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
single button push which you can do on a

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.080 
single button push which you can do on a
lot<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.770> loopers<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.280> they<00:05:27.460> also<00:05:27.640> figured

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
lot of loopers but they also figured

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.450 
lot of loopers but they also figured
they<00:05:28.210> throw<00:05:28.510> in<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.990> sort<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.650> reverse<00:05:29.860> effect

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
they throw in a sort of reverse effect

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.159 
they throw in a sort of reverse effect
for<00:05:30.669> your<00:05:30.820> guitar<00:05:30.970> it's<00:05:31.360> basically<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.810> reverse

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
for your guitar it's basically a reverse

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.920 
for your guitar it's basically a reverse
delay<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.280> sounds<00:05:33.700> like<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> reverse<00:05:34.600> delay

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
delay and it sounds like a reverse delay

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.830 
delay and it sounds like a reverse delay
so<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.680> can<00:05:35.830> kind<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.330> do<00:05:37.330> your<00:05:37.480> reverse

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
so that you can kind of do your reverse

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.659 
so that you can kind of do your reverse
solos<00:05:38.260> over<00:05:38.560> your<00:05:38.680> reverse<00:05:38.950> loop<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.430> just<00:05:39.550> be

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
solos over your reverse loop and just be

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.010 
solos over your reverse loop and just be
maximally<00:05:40.360> psychedelic<00:05:42.540> but<00:05:43.540> essentially

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
maximally psychedelic but essentially

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.690 
maximally psychedelic but essentially
again<00:05:44.320> what<00:05:44.500> sets<00:05:44.740> this<00:05:44.860> loop<00:05:45.070> apart<00:05:45.460> is

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
again what sets this loop apart is

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.810 
again what sets this loop apart is
multiple<00:05:46.240> loop<00:05:46.419> ability<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.400> really<00:05:48.400> easy

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
multiple loop ability and really easy

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.290 
multiple loop ability and really easy
sort<00:05:49.480> of<00:05:49.600> switch<00:05:50.230> based<00:05:50.590> interface<00:05:51.520> that's

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
sort of switch based interface that's

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.120 
sort of switch based interface that's
quick<00:05:52.600> and<00:05:52.780> easy<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.080> like<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.590> feel<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.890> the

on<00:06:02.830> other<00:06:03.310> loopers<00:06:04.770> that's<00:06:05.770> really<00:06:06.099> about<00:06:06.280> all

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
on other loopers that's really about all

I<00:06:06.460> have<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.759> say<00:06:06.910> about<00:06:07.389> it<00:06:07.810> is<00:06:08.020> it's<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.830> sound

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039

conversion<00:06:12.880> must<00:06:13.180> be<00:06:13.360> pretty<00:06:13.569> good<00:06:13.840> in<00:06:14.319> here

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
conversion must be pretty good in here

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.249

and<00:06:15.009> I<00:06:15.460> would<00:06:15.849> really<00:06:16.060> recommend<00:06:16.599> a<00:06:16.960> sleeper
