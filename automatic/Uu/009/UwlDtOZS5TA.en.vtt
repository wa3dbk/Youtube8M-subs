iphone<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> talk<00:00:26.310> about

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
iphone now it's going to talk about

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.470 
iphone now it's going to talk about
something<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.240> sure<00:00:27.300> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
something that we know for sure is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.779 
something that we know for sure is
coming<00:00:27.960> that's<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> iphone<00:00:29.160> 5s

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
coming that's going to be the iphone 5s

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.099 
coming that's going to be the iphone 5s
so<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so this is going to be just like the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.600 
so this is going to be just like the
iphone<00:00:31.260> 4s<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.309> probably

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
iphone 4s was going to look probably

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.209 
iphone 4s was going to look probably
exactly<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> iphone<00:00:34.200> 5<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> some

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
exactly like the iphone 5 but have some

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
exactly like the iphone 5 but have some
different<00:00:35.610> things<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.850> under<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> hood<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
different things going under the hood in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
different things going under the hood in
this<00:00:37.320> particular<00:00:37.500> case<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> big

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this particular case one of the big

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
this particular case one of the big
changes<00:00:38.820> may<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.450> fingerprint<00:00:40.320> sensor<00:00:40.710> on

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
changes may be a fingerprint sensor on

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
changes may be a fingerprint sensor on
the<00:00:41.340> home<00:00:41.610> button<00:00:41.640> itself<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.989> be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the home button itself so this would be

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
the home button itself so this would be
great<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.320> security<00:00:43.980> locking<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.489> phone

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
great for security locking your phone

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
great for security locking your phone
and<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.480> things<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:45.870> well<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.469> maybe

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and other things as well you know maybe

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
and other things as well you know maybe
getting<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.219> your<00:00:47.399> emails<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.120> locking<00:00:48.660> down

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
getting into your emails or locking down

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.510 
getting into your emails or locking down
certain<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> OS<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.340> your

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
certain things in the OS with your

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
certain things in the OS with your
fingerprint<00:00:51.059> may<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.570> easier<00:00:51.750> than

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fingerprint may be a lot easier than

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
fingerprint may be a lot easier than
trying<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> remember<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> passcode<00:00:53.190> or

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
trying to remember a passcode or

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
trying to remember a passcode or
something<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.059> should<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.329> more

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
something like that it should be more

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
something like that it should be more
secure<00:00:54.870> than<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> fingerprint

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
secure than that but the fingerprint

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
secure than that but the fingerprint
sensor<00:00:56.940> could<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> coming<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> home

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
sensor could be coming to the home

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
sensor could be coming to the home
button<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.379> whether<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
button and we don't know whether it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.290 
button and we don't know whether it's
going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> still<00:00:59.219> remain<00:00:59.489> circular<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> home

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to still remain circular that home

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to still remain circular that home
but<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.600> order<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> make<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.500> more

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
but in order to make a little bit more

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
but in order to make a little bit more
rectangular<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> able<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
rectangular to be able to get all of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
rectangular to be able to get all of
your<00:01:03.210> finger<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.690> we'll<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.049> how<00:01:04.140> Apple

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
your finger there we'll see how Apple

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.870 
your finger there we'll see how Apple
makes<00:01:04.680> that's<00:01:04.890> changed<00:01:05.250> now<00:01:05.369> another<00:01:05.610> rumor

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
makes that's changed now another rumor

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
makes that's changed now another rumor
is<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.390> camera<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:06.930> probably<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is that the camera will probably be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
is that the camera will probably be
staying<00:01:07.619> around<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.979> same<00:01:08.220> eight<00:01:08.430> megapixels

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
staying around the same eight megapixels

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.429 
staying around the same eight megapixels
but<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> will<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.600> getting<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> an

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
but it will be getting down to an

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
but it will be getting down to an
aperture<00:01:10.860> f<00:01:11.130> 2<00:01:11.400> point<00:01:11.700> 0<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> means

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
aperture f 2 point 0 and what that means

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.670 
aperture f 2 point 0 and what that means
is<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.290> able<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> take

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
is that it's going to be able to take

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
is that it's going to be able to take
better<00:01:13.920> shots<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.520> low<00:01:14.820> light<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.210> that's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
better shots in low light and that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
low light situation so Apple may be

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
low light situation so Apple may be
trying<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> combat<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.600> making<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
trying to combat that with making a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.510 
trying to combat that with making a
better<00:01:22.140> sensor<00:01:22.560> inside<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> camera<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
better sensor inside of the camera and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.679 
better sensor inside of the camera and
some<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.939> changes<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> could<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
some other changes that could be

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.940 
some other changes that could be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
happening under the hood is that it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
happening under the hood is that it
could<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.130> getting<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> new<00:01:26.610> a7<00:01:27.299> processor<00:01:27.509> is
