what worked the first thing first thing

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.570

that<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.660> talk<00:00:18.990> about<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that we have to talk about was the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.939 
that we have to talk about was the
moments<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> Busan<00:00:21.990> Alfred<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.740> episode

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
moments of Busan Alfred in this episode

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.759 
moments of Busan Alfred in this episode
which<00:00:23.430> were<00:00:23.609> pretty<00:00:23.910> epic<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.560> like

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
which were pretty epic I really like

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
which were pretty epic I really like
really<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.050> play

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
really really really like that play

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
really really really like that play
interplay<00:00:29.039> between<00:00:29.070> Alfred<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.970> Bruce

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
interplay between Alfred and Bruce

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.560 
interplay between Alfred and Bruce
because<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.470> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> breaks<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.910> stereotype

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
because it kind of breaks the stereotype

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
because it kind of breaks the stereotype
of<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> bigger<00:00:35.640> man<00:00:35.790> Cruz

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
evolved the most and actually I will go

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
evolved the most and actually I will go
as<00:01:25.830> far<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.189> saying<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> far<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.799> series

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
as far as saying so far in this series

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
as far as saying so far in this series
the<00:01:29.549> character<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.329> evolved<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> most

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the character that has evolved the most

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
the character that has evolved the most
is<00:01:31.759> Bullock<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.540> episode<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.860> till

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
is Bullock because from episode one till

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.780 
is Bullock because from episode one till
now<00:01:35.689> it's<00:01:36.689> been<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.079> gradual<00:01:38.720> understated

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
now it's been a gradual understated

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.950 
now it's been a gradual understated
specific<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:43.020> completely<00:01:44.090> well<00:01:45.090> put

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
specific and just completely well put

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
specific and just completely well put
together<00:01:46.729> evolution<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.659> really

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
together evolution that I think really

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.370 
together evolution that I think really
makes<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.250> show<00:01:50.750> actually<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.140> bit

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
makes the show actually a little bit

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
makes the show actually a little bit
more<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:53.070> enjoyable<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.960> not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
more more enjoyable because now it's not

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
more more enjoyable because now it's not
just<00:01:55.770> Jim<00:01:56.219> Gordon<00:01:56.579> against<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> world<00:01:57.270> now

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
just Jim Gordon against the world now

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
just Jim Gordon against the world now
it's<00:01:58.020> Jim<00:01:58.409> Gordon<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> Bullock<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> maybe<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it's Jim Gordon and Bullock and maybe a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600 
it's Jim Gordon and Bullock and maybe a
little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> captain<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
little bit of the captain it's just it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.240 
little bit of the captain it's just it
feels<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.990> team<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.590> being<00:02:04.799> built

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
feels more like a team is being built

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.210 
feels more like a team is being built
around<00:02:05.729> Jim<00:02:06.329> Gordon<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.110> think<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.890> gym

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
around Jim Gordon and I think the gym

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.969 
around Jim Gordon and I think the gym
has<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.879> strong<00:02:09.229> influence<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.440> him<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
has a really strong influence on him and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.340 
has a really strong influence on him and
I<00:02:11.430> also<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.030> feel<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.599> Bullock<00:02:12.870> has<00:02:13.020> an

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I also in a way feel like Bullock has an

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
I also in a way feel like Bullock has an
ison<00:02:13.650> gym<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.190> felt<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.580> episode<00:02:15.030> Jim

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
ison gym because I felt this episode Jim

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.690 
ison gym because I felt this episode Jim

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
this big old plan since episode one I'm

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.370 
this big old plan since episode one I'm
really<00:05:14.970> feeling<00:05:15.420> that<00:05:15.450> now<00:05:15.900> he's<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.170> little

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
really feeling that now he's a little

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.070 
really feeling that now he's a little
bit<00:05:16.560> improvising<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.990> it's<00:05:18.990> not<00:05:19.620> as<00:05:21.080> smart

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
bit improvising and it's not as smart

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.930 
bit improvising and it's not as smart
because<00:05:22.650> if<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.950> set<00:05:23.160> up<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.340> character<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.820> be

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
because if you set up a character to be

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.720 
because if you set up a character to be
this<00:05:24.120> smart<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.750> devious<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:25.440> an

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
this smart and devious and an

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.210 
this smart and devious and an
intelligent<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:27.410> then<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.620> see<00:05:28.830> them<00:05:29.010> like

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
intelligent and then you see them like

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.510 
intelligent and then you see them like
all<00:05:29.430> right<00:05:29.640> what<00:05:30.450> now<00:05:31.280> sometimes<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:32.460> good

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
all right what now sometimes it's good

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.360 
all right what now sometimes it's good
sometimes<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:34.080> makes<00:05:34.260> you<00:05:34.410> wonder<00:05:34.620> if<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.919> ok

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
sometimes it makes you wonder if I ok

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.070 
sometimes it makes you wonder if I ok
basically<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.360> guys<00:05:36.480> had<00:05:36.660> this<00:05:36.810> really
