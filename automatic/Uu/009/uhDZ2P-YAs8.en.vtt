00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 Good morning, people. Let's get one more. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.990
 maintenance video 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.250
 today I'll teach you how to stay 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.759
 current of the 2010 models 125 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.410
 here the brand of fashion to 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.359
 do this service you still have to give 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.930
 three key sizes ax of 13 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:28.080
 14 also lowering combined 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.630
 conditioned and a key 12 can be 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 star the key 12 of mouth there will not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 make so much difference 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.280
 To start with, we'll do what with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.800
 the key 13 according to the screw here by 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:50.300
 back and with the key 14 will release it 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.300
 come back down here 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.950
 he does not need to take out the screw 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 software does the same thing in the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 screw down here too the branch it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 down screw loosening 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 on the other side the same thing in the two 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 screws 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.740
 But this side here we go to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.740
 he up 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.119
 loosening the stove and screws in the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 screw down here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.770
 the same sure thing pulled up 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 sure the four screws the spending comes 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.900
 here the average voltage of the current 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780
 quadricycle chain 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.840
 she is really tight 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.310
 perhaps even a large gap or not equal 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 shimon peres is the dead 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 It's a lack of damnation for a penny. 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.720
 and a half down not up there and not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 there is no problem at all for the record 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:21.090
 This slack we do what the key 12 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.370
 or tighten screw to stretch or 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.860
 loose it to loosen chain 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 adjusting the attention needed for it 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.230
 making the current already in the same 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.410
 place 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.420
 always remembering the same amount of 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.670
 turns that give this screw this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.060
 nut on the nut opposite here to power 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.190
 keep quadricycles in line with this year 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.460
 same 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.460
 done it, let's press it again 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.160
 four screws 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.770
 can tighten and with enough strength only 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.130
 taking care not to exploit the 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.130
 screw 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:44.230
 squeezing tight here and 424 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.459
 fixed in place and back again the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:52.030
 screws 12 and nuts to tighten it 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.859
 door does not get loose and does not run out 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.569
 leaving with the trepidation of the tribute 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.860
 now let's not talk about the notification of the 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.750
 chain 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.960
 It is always very important to leave 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.620
 well lubricated chain to avoid 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.230
 wear is a very simple way 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.540
 I was needing brown it is with hours and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.640
 hours that the engine was the subject 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.730
 Nice could be using them. 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.250
 calmly blood basij and every time 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.870
 that using a quadricycle passes a 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.520
 little oil 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.060
 if you are a caring person 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.060
 on here 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.550
 think of all the end device PaulistÃ£o 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.980
 the week you used it after using 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.760
 wash it there when it's good 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.200
 here comes the brush in here 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.470
 on the earth even where the current 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.460
 The answer comes with the little brush 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.280
 kerosene diesel oil removes all 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.930
 dirt that can pass grease but this 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.990
 kind of thing has to be repeated 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.750
 there once a week if you have not 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.639
 Patience of me here and there goes it all 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.580
 with a diesel kerosene do this 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.139
 maintenance runs a small amount of oil that 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.139
 double orbit of dirt
