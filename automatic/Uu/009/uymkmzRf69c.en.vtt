00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.240
 André Tratador prepares track animals 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.019
 and take great care of the small and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.690
 the silks we brush every day 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.429
 No, France, when we're going to ride to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 do not blow your hair when you go 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 work braid glue not to pick up and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 do not add dirt 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.699
 and always tries to take well okay in 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 attention to the rinse in the rinse for 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 to remove all the carriage product only 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 after winning 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.129
 I do not keep her in the stall while I do not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 even because of the hull and not the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.329
 hair too right 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.460
 If there is me after the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.649
 searched there andré is right 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 keeping wet hair is a problem 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.829
 as well as using any coverage with 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.829
 it still the world this will become lais 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.899
 horse and he is with the fear one boot 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.960
 on this horse is at least 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.580
 here stifles that unity in fur and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 yes it can favor the development of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.049
 fungi that are not these of the skin, right? 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.610
 external funds that will be included 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.369
 no teaching material will be 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.710
 including the cover and environmental funds 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.320
 which ends up providing that horse 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.049
 but after all how much in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.689
 married time should be washed the ideal not 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.030
 would be to give more than one bath per month 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.000
 I already think the number is already too much 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.890
 The horse is not a species that was 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 developed what has been developed 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 over the years to shower 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 he is increasingly seen as pet then 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 this issue of bathing and 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.530
 keep them always clean and caring 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.680
 especially if Pedro 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.869
 The problem is that the search for a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.040
 beautiful bright has taken some 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.630
 exaggerations 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.940
 That animal takes a lot of bath. 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.520
 naturally by drying the hair 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.890
 He breaks too, he loses his 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 external protection 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.680
 the use of shampoos removes the dirt but 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.200
 also removes skin and oil from the hair 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.989
 the more astringent the product 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310
 The more fat it would take away the skin 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.400
 starts to dry with this binge 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.840
 It's hot and it gets ugly, and the horse starts 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.800
 to produce dandruff that we 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.320
 also called blur 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 consequently creating dry skin 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.870
 response microbial invasion and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.600
 parasites 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.819
 So you 're trying to treat a 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.950
 problem and is causing another 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.269
 then this oiliness must be maintained 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.470
 in the skin, right? 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.360
 and when we perceive the presence 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.700
 white houses 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.680
 loose by the horse is indicative of 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.989
 that his skin has already suffered bullying 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.380
 damage can be even worse if the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.150
 product used for dishwashing detergent 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.410
 frequent custom among some 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.440
 by glue handlers full wash 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.600
 with detergent it is harmful because 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.720
 she takes away the natural protection at the moment 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.209
 take the natural protection that this 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.519
 sensitivity that you have in the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.930
 animal ends up opening a door 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.410
 into the pores so that the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.420
 background bacteria already alice are and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.340
 taking advantage of this moist environment ends 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.739
 when you are creating your colonies and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.810
 end up causing the peace process and the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.420
 indicated that if you are washing glue 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.400
 clear to leave the clearest garbage to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.109
 part of the hair does not wash the part of the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.600
 birth of the hair that the leather 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.750
 hairy is the glue stick with us 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.180
 speech 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.480
 The Best Shampoos For - Are Those 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.520
 capable of removing the softer dirt 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.490
 to maintain the natural oiliness of the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.590
 skin and hair judgment in bonn good shampoos 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.140
 working companies that are both 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 can be used and if you go get 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.070
 the costs of a shampoo today are 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.380
 very similar to the cost of a soap 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 logic that is not meant to be 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.890
 done the washing of the animal has no place 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.310
 in the market at my age I do not have 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.780
 then it costs a little high soap 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.330
 neutral neutral soap unscented shampoo 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.040
 dog is not an option people shampoo 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.580
 It is not an option and soap 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.790
 even less a top even the shampoo 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.459
 if used and overdone 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.950
 remove eyes we tell this by not 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.910
 well- worn will result in a 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.770
 dry and dull the use of cover inhibits 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.460
 hair growth in winter and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.800
 brushing helps to keep them sparkling 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.600
 besides these external factors it is good to have 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.620
 in mind that any imbalance 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.530
 nutritional status or disease may 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.410
 for example horses with hyperthermia 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.020
 and the fever may have a more 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.660
 creep can but there because because the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.030
 His skin is different because you know that 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.100
 shivered by the skin needs to lose 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.300
 excess heat in teip or at least 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.300
 own 20 skin exchange space 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.220
 and hyperthermia with the environment is 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.310
 colder 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.530
 what the coat is the outer covering as 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.480
 is our hair is not the coating 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.550
 that serves for some protection 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.660
 and is also an important reserve 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.150
 nutrient 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.640
 then that animal lacking nutrient 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.960
 where do you start firing first 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.050
 Less important 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.230
 So it does not make you late for the strip. 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.490
 helmet that those tissues - vital 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.710
 for him to say so 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.600
 there begins to pull the skin until you take 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.920
 of vital organs in the 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.020
 nutrients already in the system 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.480
 talk too much in vitamin 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.380
 but does it work then does it work? 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.390
 I only cry that which is administered in 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.580
 but in the form of feed components 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.100
 nutraceutical flames that are these 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.870
 called on the market today supplements ne 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.240
 which are vitamin supplements a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.560
 protein mineral supplements 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.580
 amino acids which is the precursor shield 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.780
 horse right 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.000
 we manage along with narration 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.280
 one of the corridors of the equine pavilion 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.960
 at the expo palermo in buenos aires 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.100
 the people crowd to see the animals 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.340
 while in the stables the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.570
 groomers tirelessly brush their 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.900
 stars 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.699
 first with the chairs later with a 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.740
 brush 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:23.110
 and finally with a cloth 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.780
 always respecting the meaning of turkey 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.240
 besides removing the dirt brushing 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.479
 stimulates sebum production and 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.870
 distribution on the hair shaft 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:37.270
 returning the natural shine but attention 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.540
 no improvisations of the type to use 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.550
 Polish furniture to enhance appearance 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.979
 course of toxic products can make the 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.260
 small ulcers on the skin and even lesions 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.460
 to remove the outer layer of skin and 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.389
 this also leads to infections 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.889
 secondary 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.430
 beyond the primary jazz and 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.960
 It's painful, and it's enough 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.880
 troublesome horse including thinking 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.520
 in maintaining the grandson lost 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.070
 husband on the internet are 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.740
 active and irritation can be 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.650
 only a loss of this 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.169
 external lubrication until actually 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.840
 a more internal portion of the skin produces 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.000
 including injuries but more severe 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.090
 well away from the line another exhibition 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.419
 in the state of paraná brazil this creator 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.830
 also capricha in the visual and tells some 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.110
 of your little secrets 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.039
 I do not know why this but it was a 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.930
 horse here in the sun or by the wealth hour 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:35.200
 to leave in the shadow chance to put 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:38.139
 not only him and in staring is three 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.729
 minutes the teddy that prevents a dog 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.760
 but then why he's in here 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:45.010
 shadow 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.350
 whether or not the statement of the 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:50.410
 Our friend could not figure it out 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:53.170
 but one thing is certain horses are not 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.670
 pets need to have the 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.280
 respected nature 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.390
 only we will have healthy animals and 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:05.750
 happier
