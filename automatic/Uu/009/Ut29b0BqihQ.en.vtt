00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 Peters just a little something to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.130
 opponent said this is a second 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.040
 Team the right the turn 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 got the curve right this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 Have a good start to the season 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.100
 but the games are relatively constant 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.890
 and solid by basically similar to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 Last year, above all, are very 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 strong at home 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 So we just have to take care of that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.039
 have much of the points at home 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 brought 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.260
 Of course we also know that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.920
 far to what we expect 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.690
 So again have a hard chunk 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 every game of it had to play and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 if you do not like every game accordingly 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.460
 Seriously go to you can be a bad one 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 experience surprise 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 but I think I that we are there in 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.039
 to surprise this direction 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
 the atmosphere will be good this week 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.110
 have been the ones and cologne with 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 take on a wide breast 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 that's good the whole time 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.460
 the mood in the team is good 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.930
 we are on the way on the way we are 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.640
 We imagined we wanted to go with us 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.680
 them the last game at home here 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 decide us to show then too 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 okay we have developed 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.360
 accordingly we can on one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 The backdrop is that they did 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 but now everyday life is dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.490
 maybe I'm assuming that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 we again the majority of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 spectators will make a percentage 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 of course a bit different from 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 atmosphere 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.759
 but these are the games you do 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.799
 halt must design accordingly 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.000
 presidium flight into the game 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.200
 the team is looking forward to it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 five duties 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.409
 I take it as it comes but the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 Team likes to play 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.509
 Floodlight from the heart is always 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.900
 special games personell one 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 change of the definitive drug 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.290
 to assume it 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.970
 yes it is an open secret that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.040
 And of course it has the whole thing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.329
 Games about very well done jonas 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 It also did very well though 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.189
 Nonetheless, they roll with us 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.180
 clearly distributed and otherwise personnel 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.890
 everything on board 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.020
 Everything goes on so no 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.030
 I do not know yet 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.039
 So if you look at me too 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 Two more workouts can always be done 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.820
 Something really happens from here 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.649
 not stuck on a lineup now 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.830
 but there is not much reason to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.830
 talk
