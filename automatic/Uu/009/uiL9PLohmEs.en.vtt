one<00:00:07.870> that<00:00:07.990> you<00:00:08.080> can<00:00:08.230> think<00:00:08.440> of<00:00:09.030> one<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.119> the

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
one that you can think of one of the

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.949 
one that you can think of one of the
basic<00:00:11.020> startings<00:00:11.500> is<00:00:11.799> cocoa<00:00:12.430> powder<00:00:13.090> and<00:00:13.480> your

basic startings is cocoa powder and your
mash<00:00:14.230> I<00:00:14.650> like<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.430> put<00:00:15.549> it<00:00:15.639> into<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.879> mash<00:00:16.090> so

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
mash I like to put it into the mash so

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.640 
mash I like to put it into the mash so
that<00:00:16.480> way<00:00:16.570> it<00:00:16.690> just<00:00:16.720> stays<00:00:17.109> with<00:00:17.350> all<00:00:17.529> the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
that way it just stays with all the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.040 
that way it just stays with all the
grain<00:00:17.890> and<00:00:18.190> everything<00:00:18.310> else<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.810> that's<00:00:19.900> a

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
grain and everything else but that's a

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.870 
grain and everything else but that's a
really<00:00:20.290> nice<00:00:20.440> way<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.740> get<00:00:20.920> some<00:00:21.310> chocolate<00:00:21.610> a

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.420 
to add chocolate is to actually add
baker's<00:00:28.090> chocolate<00:00:28.890> baker's<00:00:29.890> chocolate<00:00:30.070> does

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
baker's chocolate baker's chocolate does

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.180 
baker's chocolate baker's chocolate does
contain<00:00:30.820> some<00:00:30.880> butter<00:00:31.630> fat<00:00:31.930> so<00:00:32.559> that's<00:00:32.680> an<00:00:32.890> oil

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
contain some butter fat so that's an oil

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.130 
contain some butter fat so that's an oil
so<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:33.699> like<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.030> add<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.329> at<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.540> very<00:00:34.720> end<00:00:34.989> of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
so I like to add that at the very end of

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.940 
so I like to add that at the very end of
my<00:00:35.320> boil<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:36.310> I<00:00:36.340> don't<00:00:37.290> after<00:00:38.290> flame<00:00:38.560> out<00:00:38.770> or

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
my boil so I don't after flame out or

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.200 
my boil so I don't after flame out or
knock<00:00:39.130> out<00:00:39.370> when<00:00:39.579> you're<00:00:39.700> when<00:00:39.940> you're<00:00:40.060> done

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
knock out when you're when you're done

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.000 
knock out when you're when you're done
with<00:00:40.360> your<00:00:40.390> boil<00:00:40.690> I'll<00:00:41.110> throw<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.560> chocolate

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
with your boil I'll throw in chocolate

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.170 
with your boil I'll throw in chocolate
and<00:00:42.040> I<00:00:42.190> find<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:43.180> pound<00:00:44.790> will<00:00:45.790> work<00:00:45.970> out

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
and I find that a pound will work out

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.240 
and I find that a pound will work out
really<00:00:46.450> nice<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:46.960> five<00:00:47.170> gallon<00:00:47.380> batch<00:00:47.710> so

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
really nice in a five gallon batch so

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.229 
really nice in a five gallon batch so
you<00:00:48.340> want<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.579> throw<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:48.940> there<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.149> just

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
you want to throw it in there and just

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.000 
you want to throw it in there and just
let<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:49.540> melt<00:00:49.899> away<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.470> you'll<00:00:50.590> see<00:00:50.770> all<00:00:50.890> the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
let it melt away and you'll see all the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.549 
let it melt away and you'll see all the
oils<00:00:51.460> come<00:00:51.730> up<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.120> top<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.630> you<00:00:53.290> want<00:00:53.410> to

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
oils come up to the top and you want to

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.260 
oils come up to the top and you want to
leave<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.950> behind<00:00:54.010> when<00:00:54.579> you<00:00:54.670> run<00:00:54.850> your<00:00:55.030> beer

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
leave that behind when you run your beer

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.729 
leave that behind when you run your beer
off<00:00:55.450> because<00:00:55.899> it'll<00:00:56.170> affect<00:00:56.469> your<00:00:56.620> head

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
off because it'll affect your head

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.590 
off because it'll affect your head
retention<00:00:56.920> later<00:00:57.399> on<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.180> I<00:00:58.270> find<00:00:58.510> that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
retention later on and I find that

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.690 
retention later on and I find that
adding<00:00:59.079> in<00:00:59.200> this<00:00:59.530> way<00:00:59.770> gives<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.190> really<00:01:00.550> nice

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
adding in this way gives a really nice

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.490 
adding in this way gives a really nice
creaminess<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.750> beer<00:01:02.050> from<00:01:02.260> all<00:01:02.379> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
creaminess to the beer from all the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.859 
creaminess to the beer from all the
chocolate<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.129> going<00:01:03.670> into<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.119> another

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
chocolate that is going into it another

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.449 
chocolate that is going into it another
way<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.259> can<00:01:05.409> add<00:01:05.530> chocolate<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.159> into

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:06.459 
way that you can add chocolate is into

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.550 
way that you can add chocolate is into
your<00:01:06.579> secondary<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.600> lot<00:01:07.929> of<00:01:08.020> people<00:01:08.229> like<00:01:08.409> to

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
your secondary a lot of people like to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.190 
your secondary a lot of people like to
use<00:01:08.590> cocoa<00:01:09.280> nibs<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.819> secondary<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.719> I<00:01:11.020> think

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
use cocoa nibs in secondary and I think

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.539 
use cocoa nibs in secondary and I think
this<00:01:11.350> works<00:01:11.560> out<00:01:11.709> really<00:01:11.889> nice<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.429> also

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
this works out really nice and it also

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.940 
this works out really nice and it also
adds<00:01:12.789> a<00:01:12.939> roastiness<00:01:13.359> to<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:14.020> great<00:01:14.619> thing<00:01:14.829> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
adds a roastiness to it a great thing to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.099 
adds a roastiness to it a great thing to
have<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.310> your<00:01:15.340> home<00:01:15.700> brew<00:01:15.999> collection<00:01:16.569> is<00:01:16.749> a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
it covers more surface area so these are

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.879 
it covers more surface area so these are
just<00:01:24.609> pieces<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.270> roasted<00:01:25.869> cocoa<00:01:26.469> bean<00:01:26.619> for

the most part so you can pop them into

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:37.129 
the most part so you can pop them into
your<00:01:28.869> grinder<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:30.209> just<00:01:31.209> give<00:01:31.359> it<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.539> couple

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.669 

and<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:39.159> get<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> nice<00:01:39.700> not<00:01:40.299> quite<00:01:40.599> powder<00:01:40.929> but

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
and you get a nice not quite powder but

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.669 
and you get a nice not quite powder but
it's<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.889> much<00:01:42.099> smaller<00:01:42.819> piece<00:01:43.479> than<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.439> whole

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
it's a much smaller piece than the whole
