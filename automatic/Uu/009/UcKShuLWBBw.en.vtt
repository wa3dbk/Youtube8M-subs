can actually take a look at something a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.950 
can actually take a look at something a
little<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.400> deeper<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.820> almost<00:02:32.360> decipher

little bit deeper and almost decipher
something<00:02:33.350> from<00:02:33.710> its<00:02:33.860> maybe<00:02:34.400> we're<00:02:34.610> looking

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
something from its maybe we're looking

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880 
something from its maybe we're looking
too<00:02:35.090> hard<00:02:35.240> when<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.540> do<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.080> maybe<00:02:36.350> not<00:02:36.650> I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
too hard when we do this but maybe not I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.170 
too hard when we do this but maybe not I
still<00:02:37.340> would<00:02:37.430> like<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.700> address<00:02:37.910> it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
still would like to address it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.030 
still would like to address it
nonetheless<00:02:38.450> when<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.960> look<00:02:39.140> at<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> font<00:02:39.740> it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
nonetheless when you look at the font it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580 
nonetheless when you look at the font it
honestly<00:02:40.670> looks<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.390> blend<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.380> black

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
honestly looks like a blend of the black

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.160 
honestly looks like a blend of the black
ops<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.400> well<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:43.820> Lea<00:02:43.910> black<00:02:44.060> ops<00:02:44.450> 2<00:02:44.750> font

if you guys do remember the black ops
one<00:02:47.420> font<00:02:47.810> was<00:02:47.990> very<00:02:48.290> similar<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.800> i<00:02:48.980> want<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
one font was very similar to i want to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.670 
one font was very similar to i want to
say<00:02:49.460> an<00:02:49.640> aerial<00:02:50.120> type<00:02:50.390> font<00:02:50.720> where<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.170> has<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
say an aerial type font where it has the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.220 
say an aerial type font where it has the
rounded<00:02:52.130> edges<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.090> also<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.570> quite

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
rounded edges but it also is quite

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.320 
rounded edges but it also is quite
simplistic<00:02:54.710> in<00:02:55.100> its<00:02:55.250> own<00:02:55.400> sense<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.150> black

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
simplistic in its own sense the black

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.500 
simplistic in its own sense the black
ops<00:02:56.540> 2<00:02:56.780> font<00:02:57.140> was<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.740> lot<00:02:58.160> more<00:02:58.400> blocky<00:02:58.880> as<00:02:59.180> well

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
ops 2 font was a lot more blocky as well

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.600 
ops 2 font was a lot more blocky as well
as<00:02:59.660> condensed<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.860> had<00:03:01.010> its<00:03:01.190> own<00:03:01.370> little

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
as condensed and it had its own little

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.390 
as condensed and it had its own little
vibe<00:03:02.000> about<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.600> now<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:03.170> does<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.890> me<00:03:03.920> look

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
vibe about it now it does to me look

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.910 
vibe about it now it does to me look
like<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.760> combination<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.630> both<00:03:06.140> now<00:03:06.440> i<00:03:06.470> can't

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
like a combination of both now i can't

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.520 
like a combination of both now i can't
say<00:03:07.190> what<00:03:07.790> era<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.210> is<00:03:08.390> going<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.810> be<00:03:09.020> or<00:03:09.230> what

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
say what era this is going to be or what

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.110 
say what era this is going to be or what
it's<00:03:09.710> going<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.400> stem<00:03:10.790> from<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
it's going to really stem from that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.450 
it's going to really stem from that
because<00:03:11.270> obviously<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.930> itself<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.830> looking

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
because obviously that itself is looking

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.520 
because obviously that itself is looking
way<00:03:13.700> too<00:03:13.730> far<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:14.780> i<00:03:14.810> do<00:03:14.900> believe<00:03:15.110> that

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
way too far but i do believe that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.780 
way too far but i do believe that
they're<00:03:15.770> going<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.100> following<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.550> same

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
get this message as well again and if

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.470 
get this message as well again and if
you<00:03:39.980> want<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.190> look<00:03:40.280> very<00:03:40.340> deeply<00:03:41.210> then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
you want to look very deeply then

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.120 
you want to look very deeply then
potentially<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.560> could<00:03:42.620> lead<00:03:43.070> to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
potentially this could lead to

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.340 
potentially this could lead to
ultimately<00:03:43.940> some<00:03:44.270> sort<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.600> game<00:03:44.870> design<00:03:45.050> that

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
ultimately some sort of game design that

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.870 
ultimately some sort of game design that
we<00:03:45.440> can<00:03:45.590> pull<00:03:45.800> from<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.130> being<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
we can pull from this being that the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.210 
we can pull from this being that the
fonts<00:03:47.270> are<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.720> similar<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.170> black<00:03:48.590> ops<00:03:48.830> 2<00:03:49.010> as

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
fonts are so similar to black ops 2 as

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.550 
fonts are so similar to black ops 2 as
well<00:03:49.430> as<00:03:49.520> black<00:03:49.790> ops<00:03:50.030> 1<00:03:50.390> perhaps<00:03:51.020> continuing

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
well as black ops 1 perhaps continuing

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.830 
well as black ops 1 perhaps continuing
the<00:03:51.680> trend<00:03:51.920> there<00:03:52.310> or<00:03:52.520> just<00:03:52.660> continuing<00:03:53.660> on

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
the trend there or just continuing on

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.050 
the trend there or just continuing on
the<00:03:54.050> tray<00:03:54.320> arc<00:03:54.500> feel<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.520> games<00:03:55.760> but

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
the tray arc feel of the games but

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.580 
the tray arc feel of the games but
that's<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:56.780> going<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.960> wrap<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.140> up<00:03:57.350> thank
