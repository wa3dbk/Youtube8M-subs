00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.530
 Hi, it starts me saying that he is commenting 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.820
 new video but you in which I 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.820
 I'll have a click 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.029
 in this update it's worth what we 're going 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.410
 to need is to put the game 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 survival with creative what 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.789
 you want is to have chests of these 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 bonus just start the game 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.130
 infinite worth and good for they are not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.230
 good put on objective survival and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 we have to go to more options and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 put the bonus box is worth as 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.410
 you are seeing there I have put the chest 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 bonus 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 ok then we are going to create a new 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.870
 world would have mayor intendente 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.149
 intro intendis 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 Well, tell you that this cliché is 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.960
 just for that if you want to start 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 a new survival game and it gave you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.510
 a little bit of company to pick up 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.360
 materials and all that 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.970
 a small handicap it would be this 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.369
 cliché that we're going to see now that it's a 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.530
 clip that I think is pretty good 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.900
 if it is not because it is being collected 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.780
 tools and all that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.040
 and well now let's see how is this 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.730
 that is loading me here 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.420
 in what the game is worth and let's see 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.990
 how easy it is to get it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.270
 once we are here we are going to look 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.250
 our chest our chest of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
 bonus that I do not encounter 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.789
 but it is here under this tree worth 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.549
 well once we have it there when 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.830
 we have the chest open and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.720
 We collect everything in it 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.939
 here I remove the torches I do not know why 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 what but good we collect everything there 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.270
 inside as we see here there is bread 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 stone tools and all that have 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.390
 pretty good and good we take and break 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.119
 the chest we take the chest and keep it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.319
 or throw them wherever we want 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.970
 will correspond when we have broken it 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.850
 we give out the game come out and save 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 the game is saved and all that is true 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.540
 it has to be a new map, it's worth not worth 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.760
 one that is not new but good 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 we go back to the world after 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.420
 of having left like this and always 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.870
 whenever we break the chest of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.909
 bonus that we had at the beginning 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.540
 we will always see another chest of 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.069
 new unification with new objects 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.889
 tell you that every time you change places 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.829
 the bonus box but always 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.379
 close to the initial and good answer here 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.689
 I missed this natural mine but 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.709
 well here it is here you see it 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.109
 you have seen that he has appeared in another 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.209
 site and I have not touched anything and it has 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.519
 many more things apples bread wood 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.670
 planks have everything are worth and good and 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.980
 then it will break again 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.590
 if you want you stay with the chest and 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.319
 now we will go out again from the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.780
 game come out and save accept and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.669
 we would go back into our world and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.099
 we already have another chest that can be in 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.319
 the same place as the previous one or you can 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.569
 change of site depends on the times 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.329
 that you do it or like that but it's always 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.879
 close to the initial response good this 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.680
 cliché is pretty easy in a way 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.400
 pretty easy to get objects in 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.159
 survival without creative knowledge or in case 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.959
 you want or if you want a series do a 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.260
 Survival starting to get the 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.390
 achievements 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.540
 it's a good way also pretty 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.430
 easy as you are seeing here I already have 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.189
 almost all the inventory filled as if 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.950
 I would have been picking up like 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.209
 I would have been doing a series 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.790
 yielding a normal survival game 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.299
 and current and good, that's all 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.709
 I assist you as many times as you want, you can 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.530
 place the chests pres guarding 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.540
 things but does not possess anything are worth so 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.060
 good to give the expori all its not 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.189
 you are and good to tell you that this clip if 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.930
 you can use it for all times 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:19.820
 what you want and for everything you want and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.820
