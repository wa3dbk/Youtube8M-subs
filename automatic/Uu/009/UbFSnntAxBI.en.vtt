00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
holes which I don't know if if you play

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
holes which I don't know if if you play
on<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> server<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> before<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
on a server you know that before if you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
on a server you know that before if you
travel<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.399> far<00:00:56.930> there'd<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> huge<00:00:58.500> gap<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
travel so far there'd be a huge gap and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
travel so far there'd be a huge gap and
it<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.250> such<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> pain<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it was such a pain because you have to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
it was such a pain because you have to
you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.710> had<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> disconnect<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you know you had to disconnect and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
you know you had to disconnect and
reconnect<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:04.199> became<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> pain

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
reconnect and it just just became a pain

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.330 
reconnect and it just just became a pain
to<00:01:05.610> travel<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> distance<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.020> now

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
to travel any kind of a distance but now

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600 
to travel any kind of a distance but now
it<00:01:08.340> seems<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.880> fixed<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.280> big<00:01:11.280> thanx

to<00:01:11.729> notch<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.180> getting<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.450> taken<00:01:12.630> care<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
to notch for getting that taken care of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
to notch for getting that taken care of
another<00:01:14.790> big<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.420> noticed<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
another big thing that I noticed was the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
another big thing that I noticed was the
shading<00:01:17.000> can't<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.150> tell<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.509> now

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
shading can't really tell right now

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
shading can't really tell right now
because<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.020> aren't<00:01:19.170> any<00:01:19.350> torches<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because there aren't any torches and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
because there aren't any torches and
it's<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.189> dark<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.930> he<00:01:21.930> did<00:01:22.110> improve<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's not dark but he did improve the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
it's not dark but he did improve the
shading<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.430> thank<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.200> improving

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
shading so thank you for for improving

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
shading so thank you for for improving
the<00:01:25.650> shading<00:01:26.009> match<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:29.240> another

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the shading match way to go another

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
the shading match way to go another
thing<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.110> different<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
thing that I think is different is the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
thing that I think is different is the
way<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> world<00:01:32.909> drawers<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> stuff<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
way that the world drawers and stuff in

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
way that the world drawers and stuff in
the<00:01:34.500> background<00:01:34.820> maybe<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.119> me<00:01:36.509> being

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the background maybe it's just me being

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
the background maybe it's just me being
dumb<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.549> looks<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.329> bit

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
dumb but it looks like it's a little bit

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
dumb but it looks like it's a little bit
smoother<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.400> render

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
smoother right now I have my render

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.770 
smoother right now I have my render
distance<00:01:41.700> set<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.290> normal<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> I'm

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
distance set to I think normal and I'm

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.670 
distance set to I think normal and I'm
noticing<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.829> lot<00:01:47.040> less<00:01:47.340> glitching<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.869> lot

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
noticing a lot less glitching I'm a lot

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.210 
noticing a lot less glitching I'm a lot
less<00:01:49.890> lag<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.790> before<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.220> chug

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
less lag like before it would like chug

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.770 
less lag like before it would like chug
you<00:01:53.490> know<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> sit<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.509> try

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you know it would just sit there and try

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.120 
you know it would just sit there and try
to<00:01:54.840> draw<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> background<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to draw in the background but now it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.810 
to draw in the background but now it
seems<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> lot<00:01:57.180> smoother<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.820> what

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
seems like it's a lot smoother so what

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.209 
seems like it's a lot smoother so what
else<00:02:00.000> has<00:02:00.149> changed<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.920> don't<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> full

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
else has changed I don't have the full

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340 
else has changed I don't have the full
list<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.579> front<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> me<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.090> from<00:02:03.210> now<00:02:03.450> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
list in front of me but from now for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.820 
list in front of me but from now for
right<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.210> um

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
right now that's that's all I can see um

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.070 
right now that's that's all I can see um
so<00:02:08.430> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.820> bridge<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.119> leads<00:02:09.630> from<00:02:09.840> my

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
so this is the bridge that leads from my

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.650 
so this is the bridge that leads from my
castle<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.710> my<00:02:10.830> friends<00:02:11.130> castle<00:02:11.490> which<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.970> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
castle to my friends castle which is in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.480 
castle to my friends castle which is in
Bell<00:02:12.810> Chet<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.890> he'll<00:02:14.040> he'll<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.310> to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
Bell Chet but he'll he'll go to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.710 
Bell Chet but he'll he'll go to
eventually<00:02:15.680> see<00:02:17.000> what<00:02:18.000> else<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.660> done

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
eventually see what else have I done

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.350 
eventually see what else have I done
since<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.590> last<00:02:19.740> video<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.790> pretty<00:02:21.240> much

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
since the last video this is pretty much

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.100 
since the last video this is pretty much
it<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.900> did<00:02:22.590> make<00:02:23.040> an<00:02:23.280> underwater<00:02:24.110> mining

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it I did make an underwater mining

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.050 
it I did make an underwater mining
mining<00:02:25.770> operation<00:02:26.370> I'll<00:02:26.580> show<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> guys<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
mining operation I'll show you guys that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.400 
mining operation I'll show you guys that
in<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> minute<00:02:28.820> this<00:02:29.820> bridge<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.570> freaking<00:02:31.200> long

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
in a minute this bridge is freaking long

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
in a minute this bridge is freaking long
I<00:02:31.740> think<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:32.520> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.970> put<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
I think what we're going to do is put a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.930 
I think what we're going to do is put a
mine<00:02:33.390> mine<00:02:33.990> track<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> middle<00:02:34.940> just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
mine mine track here in the middle just

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.820 
mine mine track here in the middle just
so<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.510> back<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.720> forth<00:02:36.990> easier<00:02:37.410> oh

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.620 

and<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.890> did<00:02:41.070> figure<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.450> no

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and I did figure out that there is no

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.990 
and I did figure out that there is no
end<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> Minecraft<00:02:43.890> world<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.400> saw<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
end to the Minecraft world I saw a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.540 
end to the Minecraft world I saw a
couple<00:02:45.210> of<00:02:45.330> videos<00:02:45.600> where<00:02:45.630> basically<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
couple of videos where basically if you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.550 
couple of videos where basically if you
just<00:02:47.790> keep<00:02:47.940> walking<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.480> any<00:02:48.630> direction<00:02:48.810> it'll

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
just keep walking in any direction it'll

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.199 
just keep walking in any direction it'll
keep<00:02:49.980> generating<00:02:50.250> world<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:53.209> think

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
keep generating world for you so I think

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.220 
keep generating world for you so I think
that's<00:02:54.360> pretty<00:02:54.540> cool<00:02:55.580> see<00:02:56.580> I'm<00:02:56.970> still<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that's pretty cool see I'm still not to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.610 
that's pretty cool see I'm still not to
my<00:02:58.350> castle<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.290> long<00:03:01.500> bridge

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
my castle this is a really long bridge

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.870 
my castle this is a really long bridge
one<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.800> things<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.700> start

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
one of the things that I want to start

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.370 
one of the things that I want to start
playing<00:03:06.120> around<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:06.600> our<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> mine<00:03:07.110> tracks

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
playing around with our the mine tracks

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.640 
playing around with our the mine tracks
I'm<00:03:08.220> not<00:03:08.430> quite<00:03:09.300> sure<00:03:09.330> how<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:09.930> work<00:03:10.140> yet<00:03:10.380> but

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
I'm not quite sure how they work yet but

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.220 
I'm not quite sure how they work yet but
they<00:03:11.370> look<00:03:11.580> pretty<00:03:11.760> interesting<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.600> I'm

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
they look pretty interesting so I'm

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.850 
they look pretty interesting so I'm
probably<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.800> starting<00:03:14.370> out<00:03:14.519> my<00:03:15.620> my<00:03:16.620> little

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
probably be starting out my my little

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680 
probably be starting out my my little
mind<00:03:17.070> track<00:03:17.459> series<00:03:17.760> i'm<00:03:18.120> probably<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.600> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
mind track series i'm probably going to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.830 
mind track series i'm probably going to
be<00:03:18.780> making<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:20.150> first<00:03:21.150> time<00:03:21.360> probably<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.660> make

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
be making a first time probably to make

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.750 
be making a first time probably to make
a<00:03:21.870> track<00:03:22.170> down<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.560> my<00:03:22.650> mining<00:03:22.980> operation<00:03:23.519> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
a track down in my mining operation and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.160 
a track down in my mining operation and
then<00:03:24.300> i'm<00:03:24.390> going<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.720> about<00:03:24.959> making

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
then i'm going to think about making

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.860 
then i'm going to think about making
like<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> monorail<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:27.209> goes<00:03:27.390> around<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
like a monorail it goes around the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.560 
like a monorail it goes around the
island<00:03:29.600> well<00:03:30.600> first<00:03:30.840> let<00:03:31.110> me<00:03:31.140> show<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.440> guys<00:03:31.590> I

underground mining operation can I get

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.259 
underground mining operation can I get
to<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> water<00:03:41.459> from<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:41.880> no<00:03:42.120> crap<00:03:43.370> okay<00:03:44.370> to
