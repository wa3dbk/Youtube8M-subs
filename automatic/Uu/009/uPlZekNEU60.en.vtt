00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
our example we have lead this team to

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.900 
our example we have lead this team to
just<00:04:44.990> replace<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.470> without<00:04:45.560> HTML<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.550> then

just replace it without HTML and then
again<00:04:47.240> file<00:04:47.570> see<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.790> close<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.270> now

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
again file see that close it and now

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.960 
again file see that close it and now
switch<00:04:51.830> over<00:04:51.980> to<00:04:52.480> but<00:04:53.480> again<00:04:54.430> 1:27<00:04:55.430> dot<00:04:55.670> zero

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
switch over to but again 1:27 dot zero

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.200 
switch over to but again 1:27 dot zero
dot<00:04:56.000> zero<00:04:56.420> dot<00:04:56.450> one<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:58.060> click<00:04:59.060> it

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
dot zero dot one and we just click it

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.680 
dot zero dot one and we just click it
now<00:04:59.900> we<00:04:59.960> have<00:05:00.310> example<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.940> before<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.510> you

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
now we have example so before this you

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.200 
now we have example so before this you
have<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.960> change<00:05:03.230> your<00:05:03.380> code<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.800> bit<00:05:03.980> now<00:05:04.730> open

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
have to change your code a bit now open

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.110 
have to change your code a bit now open
the<00:05:05.510> index<00:05:05.960> page<00:05:06.200> edit<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.310> with<00:05:07.460> notepad<00:05:07.670> plus
