00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 the villain whip of the sun who already asked for more 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 a finishing job 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.449
 my name is rafael bernardini the baby 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 cluster show you how to manage 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.199
 Another ray perve a server hype fi can 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.439
 being fast and sawing can be quick and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.630
 remotely in a group of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 I work a lot of people ask me this. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 rafael if I came here and I put the name 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 from my name or from another notebook 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 also another machine that the server does not 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 it works and if I put the ipÃª, too ok 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 this does not give a good idea how it is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.149
 If this is resolved, there are some steps 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.899
 first let's do through the name 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.489
 only to be able to access the name of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 a network computer that is not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 I have a work group that does not have the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.049
 centralized dns that should be your case 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.040
 You have to edit the hosts file to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.110
 your machine 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 Let's open a purple file for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:22.439
 tell what is the ipi name you want 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 access da oim dolce 62 drivers mark 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:32.970
 rush all files that I will 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:35.430
 put here I put here 192 168 5 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.930
 that in case my server I put another 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 always what I want is to leave I'll put 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.579
 here note hp or close and I will save to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.909
 test on the cmd and gives a ping by 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.509
 name roque is now answering 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.430
 name 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.930
 even without the centralized dns that is 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.079
 group environmental characteristic 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 work but you see here still can not 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.950
 it's good 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.290
 The second step is required on the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.290
 control panel here 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.870
 and add the credential of that other 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 machine is here 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.080
 credentials 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.819
 you can do it from the command line 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.760
 by cdm from here but you can see here 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.300
 You can see what this process is like. 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.239
 I can add a credential with 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 the server name in the dihpp name of the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.940
 user admin tone and password 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.720
 I added manually to 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.370
 credential for my other 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 hp server here in my case is a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 hp notebook with rap installed for 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.989
 manage it through my father prf 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.660
 ok let's go there again note hp not yet 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.640
 missed something 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.690
 Good, what's missing, is it missing? 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:07.200
 to configure the decom here is how 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:10.290
 you will do this concert and g and 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.910
 give it cef and here we 'll set it up 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.810
 enable remote user execution 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.180
 anonymous right click on my computer 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.260
 property security edit limits that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.420
 soon an anonymous 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.950
 We'll do the remote access too. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.139
 with the anonymous pa 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.810
 ok ok ok very important close and open 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:40.859
 the hype console and for this to work 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:45.930
 I closed the console and I will comment now 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:47.639
 My note hp and that's when I access the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.420
 virtual machines can connect 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:55.440
 Remotely, can I call while working? 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.870
 normally remotely on a server 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.670
 ray perve in group environment 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.639
 I was sleeping I had been working 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.989
 difference not only do you put the credential 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.030
 of the right domain 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.139
 So it's that simpler than 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.160
 it seems right 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.989
 it's easy to manage the next time there 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.930
 I will be commenting on how 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.660
 manage this promotes pm the prudent 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.650
 remote is not your 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.419
 local ticket 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.419
 I hope you enjoyed the next
