00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 we started big the change of 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.040
 this week because we have 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.569
 come up bayona because here it 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 celebrates a new test of the championship 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.360
 de españa de trial is the fourth test 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.309
 for tr1 the fifth for tr2 and the seventh 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 for the other categories here also 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.820
 of the big ones of the national trial it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.820
 they find the great ones of the world 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.410
 the Galician fans responded in a big way 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.690
 and baiona was too small to accommodate 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
 to the big ones of the modality and is that 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.680
 until the Pontevedra locality traveled 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.600
 45 registered people from all over Spain 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 distributed in the different categories 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.160
 of r1 r2 r3 r4 junior and cadet but without 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.019
 doubt all eyes focused on 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.940
 the big ones in this sport the big 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.250
 of the championship of Spain that boast of 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.809
 be it also in the world all 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.030
 classes focused on the so-called 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.700
 four magnificent the 14 times champion 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.160
 of the world toni bou adam raga albert 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.320
 cabestany and jeróni fajardo but in 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 Bayona highlighted one that played at home 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.399
 and who is called to be the successor of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.649
 all of them is none other than the champion 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.300
 of the junior jorge world casales that was 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.300
 tremendously clothed by the fans 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.009
 precisely in the category of pro 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.049
 who took the victory was the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.000
 current world champion toni bou that in 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.759
 the 12 demanding zones of bayona 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.759
 It showed why its 14 titles 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.039
 worldwide in this way and with only 9 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.140
 bous penalties she practically 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.939
 the title of champion of Spain since a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.310
 lack of a test to end the 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.110
 season is four points to achieve 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.970
 the laurel been a trial tremendously 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 complicated yes the truth that especially 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.539
 the first areas were wet 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.250
 patinated much later the last ones with the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.649
 wind and the sun have dried up a lot and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.539
 much better in principle we have failed 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.880
 a little but good a very good race 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.349
 as always and tomorrow plus some 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.060
 areas what many two pilots said 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.250
 that were maybe a little complicated other 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.560
 good end of cattle me with nine 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.450
 points and I think that the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.740
 points was not not a career too 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.720
 difficult the dangers I think it has been 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.500
 well that public has enjoyed and that's 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.849
 what is it about 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.370
 important points that in the absence of a 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.989
 good test, you keep getting points 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.299
 in between, not against your maximum 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.739
 rival yes very important also that for 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.890
 haarde subdued by the middle and five 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.900
 more points are now 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.450
 4 the only points you should get 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.670
 for to get title so a 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.710
 important day very good and good memory 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.300
 of bayona because always 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.430
 well we have to ask for late 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.850
 also for that achievement of those of the world 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.890
 that you already get 14 consecutive seven 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.330
 my mother yes the truth that there are many 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.850
 be've suffered a lot until 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.670
 final and we got it in the last area 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.080
 so it has been very hard and it also 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.490
 they enjoy more in this way the year that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.140
 comes more and better we are still there 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.120
 good goal if you have to try it not 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.040
 more and more young people come 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.780
 strong as jorge and as as paul 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.010
 also but good also adam has 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.570
 been very strong all year so 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.830
 It will be difficult for sure since we are here 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.020
 in my land I have to ask for myself 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.550
 by my colleague in what is jorge casales 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.710
 as it is next year already with 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.660
 you very well the truth that Jorge is 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.780
 incredible is a very very good driver 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.220
 It has some very good qualities so 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.780
 He has everything to get to do it very 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 well and fighting for the world cup is very 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 young man still and good if you take with 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.630
 calm and do it well sure it's going to 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.330
 arrive accompanying bow on the podium 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.040
 pilot must workshop and fajardo third 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.080
 Raga was that like in the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.980
 World Cup if the national title escapes him 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.810
 before bow 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.520
 I am very happy, it has come out quite 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.750
 ok everything and leave behind everything because 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.900
 I had missed the last race 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.079
 I was 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.260
 and well he did not have many references 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.269
 escaped at once they have pulled hard the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.579
 race pace even I have 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.579
 penalized some time point I think 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.310
 but good at the end well more or less 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.810
 doing the trial that the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.510
 regulation when you make third in the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.370
 previous race you have to start first and 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.010
 it's hard to open areas of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.200
 no reference and all terrain is 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.840
 virgin but good I'm happy 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.209
 I believe that in the end I have 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.129
 done well and good for ahead 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.159
 cabestany finished the fourth and fifth 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.389
 was the local driver jorge casales good 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.069
 the goal was to make podium 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.329
 fourth good fifth place is also not 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.799
 bad after this season 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.049
 world title you've brought home 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.370
 yes that is a result that with I am 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.260
 quite happy I vote are doing 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.580
 200 positions is a result that is 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.530
 pretty good although I would like to be 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.810
 ever enter a fourth place 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.840
 that would be to win one of the four 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.330
 fantastic but it is very difficult to work 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.039
 work a lot and a lot of time in tr2 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.740
 jaime taste in which the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.169

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.620

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.620
 7 penalties that took him directly 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.139

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.630

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.110
 podium 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.620
 the show does not just end with the 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.630
 championship of spain of trial but 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.340
