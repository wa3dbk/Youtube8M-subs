00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.180
 good hello everyone welcome here goes 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.000
 the tutorial of the flourish that I have done 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.810
 in my other channel if you do not know what the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.080
 I refer here a link to 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.460
 explain here this letter that caixa is 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.050
 letter and you can see the performance is 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.939
 vale d 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.800
 of this flower and tour so to the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.610
 seen and you have come here to see the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.580
 tutorial well welcome 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.180
 let's start with the tutorial for 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.760
 this 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.440
 to start what we are going to need is 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.930
 put us in this position 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.940
 OK 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.880
 who does not do it to do it explained 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 so we would start a bit in this 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.720
 position the middle finger and the finger 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.650
 index on this side and the thumb on 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.150
 the other short side 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.790
 in this way 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.560
 you can use the ring finger if 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.480
 you also want to put here but I 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.760
 I do not usually use it 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.070
 then with him on the index finger of the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.960
 left hand let's start this 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.240
 package is worth it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.510
 so that it is agile free with the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.500
 thumb of the right hand 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.230
 of this unit 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.230
 let's take about 20 letters or so 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.189
 something like that 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.969
 and with the index finger we are going to start this 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.969
 package too 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.579
 he says we come here and we also leave 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.110
 about 20 25 letters to leave the package 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.800
 big in the middle 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.720
 let's turn this hand down and 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.150
 this package up to be able 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.250
 reach the middle pack with the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.430
 finger heart and the thumb of the hand 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.430
 left 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.880
 this way 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 and puncture it and get it out 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.399
 something like that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.399
 we come here 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.739
 we click 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 we throw our right hand up and 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.860
 we are left with this 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.470
 we drop this package at hand 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.580
 and with the index finger we start this 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.580
 package so that we have something like that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 we leave we leave we catch 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.109
 and we left 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.810
 once here with the thumb we're going to 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.750
 contact this package in the middle of this 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.939
 unit let's let go of the middle what 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.939
 let's move on to the thumb 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.880
 we are here thumb 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.520
 we were going to pull this thumb towards 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.670
 ing back and this hand prior to 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.220
 that the middle package 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.890
 that from above 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.950
 OK 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.120
 and this package down here that is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.819
 between the thumb and the index finger 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.319
 let's let go 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:24.470
 OK 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:29.630
 from the beginning we would have something like that 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.100
 so here we use steps 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.260
 go ahead and we drop we need here 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.540
 we go back down the package is worth this is 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.990
 a movement I guess you'll already know 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.370
 do 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.370
 when we are here 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.320
 we passed it down and we spent this 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.320
 package down to the index finger 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.980
 we passed the index 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.480
 then we go back to split this package 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.870
 from above we divide it again with the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.290
 index 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.319
 and we would do as we did the dynamo 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.280
 shuffle okay it would be throwing this in there 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.540
 with the thumb and heart we take the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.800
 of the middle and now with this from 2 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.060
 we squeeze with these two and this over 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.550
 we get out 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.980
 and we put it back on it is worth something 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.070
 A) Yes 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.610
 in the middle means 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.610
 Oh 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.300
 once here the ring finger will pass to 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.370
 of the middle and the package of rhyme to the finger 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.169
 medium when we are here 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.229
 this ring finger would go to this 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.650
 and the thumb I mean the heart to 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.650
 above 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.409
 from the beginning we would go up 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.309
 we drop we go down 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.689
 we put the medium changes even if the fingers 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:09.679
 We are going to come here with your thumb 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:12.019
 of the left hand to pull us towards 

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:13.889
 in front rotating with the middle finger of 

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:16.810
 the right order 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.639
 and this package in the middle 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.300
 we are going to take it out of this unit 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.300
 malik 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.910
 thompson 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.389
 and we take it out 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.780
 ok I'm going to repeat it since you can 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.430
 you seem a little complicated we have 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.230
 this way 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.350
 we come here 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.210
 and we make pressure and trans forward 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.030
 every time with this package the medium 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.120
 we throw back 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.620
 so that we will be over 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.190
 now with the index finger we are going to click 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.550
 this package in this way is worth 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:04.370
 making it slow are a bit difficult 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:11.500
 basically it would be to come here 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.500
 and drag this pack up here is worth 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.370
 it would be something like that 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.789
 OK 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.340
 here 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.590
 sorry Yes 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.740
 we passed 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.950
 and we drag it once it reaches the end 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.850
 let's throw your hand forward with 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.960
 the one that remains so with me and with my finger 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.360
 heart of the left hand we are going to 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.490
 come here 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.390
 to rotate this package 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.850
 and drop it on top of it 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.340
 once here with the left hand we're going 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.610
 to make the six oscar that does not know is 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.610
 A) Yes 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.920
 OK 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.380
 and with the right hand we're going to in this 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.750
 position of the heart will come to 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.900
 this corner and the thumb to this 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.419
 other 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.419
 with the index finger we are going to come here 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.800
 what are we going to do sorry and we're going to 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.800
 throw everything together 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.940
 there 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.800
 there 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.509
 we put and throw 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.440
