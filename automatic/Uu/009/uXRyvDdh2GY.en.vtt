00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 to understand it 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.220
 is simulating 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.640
 while this happens in the field 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.240
 now it's over 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.240
 What's up 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.370
 when this move 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 when our welfare has not lost 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 as not garage but neither do they pass 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.989
 recover it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 neither the difference 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.350
 a person 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.220
 what happens in the field 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.929
 but they do not make the song 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.929
 the base turned to the sea 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 97 What is waiting is a more attacked world 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.900
 We are looking forward to the fencing 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.400
 being the only option and a situation 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.380
 is what we're going to see is the same as if 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.880
 you put that play on the circuit that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.720
 is magnificently from the point of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 view of the televised mind 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 why it happens 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.910
 because I think he 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 when the port is finished 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 It is left behind 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.930
 this cancellation of the credit is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.630
 simultaneous what we're going to see in the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.700
 field with organism 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 I was very good I risked higher 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 for this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.010
 thanks to youth and life 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.530
 they are things that have gone wrong for the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.530
 images by actions 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.140
 the seeds
