toward if I had a chipboard piece I
traced<00:04:02.740> it<00:04:02.890> over<00:04:03.160> because<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.580> didn't<00:04:04.000> have

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
traced it over because I didn't have

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.790 
traced it over because I didn't have
multiples<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.320> fotomat

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
right here and she is able to put the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.310 
right here and she is able to put the
picture<00:04:15.010> right<00:04:15.040> there<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.140> is

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
picture right there so and then this is

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.580

a<00:04:17.350> little<00:04:17.620> pocket<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:19.450> tool<00:04:19.720> little<00:04:20.170> charms

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
a little pocket some tool little charms

his<00:04:20.739> promise<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.670> again<00:04:22.180> same<00:04:22.990> stamp<00:04:23.260> set

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.220 

this<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:28.000> actually<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.360> think<00:04:28.450> it's<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.840> Stampin

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
this is actually I think it's a Stampin

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.400 
this is actually I think it's a Stampin
Up<00:04:29.350> stamp<00:04:30.210> she<00:04:31.210> had<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:31.600> her<00:04:31.720> invitation

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
Up stamp she had this on her invitation

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.630 
Up stamp she had this on her invitation
and<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.800> taught<00:04:33.460> apart<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:35.170> put<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:36.520> her

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
and I taught apart and put it on in her

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.020 
and I taught apart and put it on in her
book

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.610 

this<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.539> I<00:04:40.690> said<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.020> really<00:04:41.410> simple

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
this is like I said it's really simple

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.369 
this is like I said it's really simple
so<00:04:42.129> the<00:04:42.580> pages<00:04:43.120> are<00:04:43.210> basically<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:44.970> opposite

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
so the pages are basically just opposite

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.960 
so the pages are basically just opposite
some<00:04:47.379> prima<00:04:47.650> polish<00:04:48.069> and<00:04:48.430> recollections

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
some prima polish and recollections

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.960 
some prima polish and recollections
playing<00:04:49.240> again<00:04:49.629> these<00:04:50.020> little<00:04:50.970> crystal

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
playing again these little crystal

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.469 
playing again these little crystal
things<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.830> these<00:04:54.069> i<00:04:54.460> only<00:04:54.909> had<00:04:55.060> one<00:04:55.330> above

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
things like these i only had one above

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.210 
things like these i only had one above
and<00:04:58.479> I<00:04:58.569> think<00:04:58.780> Arlene<00:04:59.289> had<00:04:59.560> given<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.009> to<00:05:00.069> me

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.719 
and I think Arlene had given it to me
and<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:01.740> something<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.860> she<00:05:03.069> sent<00:05:03.310> me<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> while

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
and a something that she sent me a while

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:11.600 
and a something that she sent me a while
Bo<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:05.229> I<00:05:05.259> had<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.500> trace<00:05:05.830> all<00:05:06.159> of<00:05:06.580> them<00:05:09.479> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
Bo and so I had to trace all of them and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.529 
Bo and so I had to trace all of them and
trace<00:05:12.610> these<00:05:12.970> two<00:05:13.509> are<00:05:13.690> i<00:05:13.720> hand<00:05:14.080> drew<00:05:14.169> these

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
trace these two are i hand drew these

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.790 
trace these two are i hand drew these
just<00:05:16.539> a<00:05:16.690> little<00:05:17.069> pop<00:05:18.069> it<00:05:18.250> right<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:19.800> same

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
just a little pop it right there same

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.510 
just a little pop it right there same
thing<00:05:21.099> I<00:05:21.280> UT<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.909> edges<00:05:22.330> on<00:05:22.720> both<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:23.080> them

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
thing I UT the edges on both of them

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.270 
thing I UT the edges on both of them
same<00:05:24.520> thing<00:05:26.580> next<00:05:27.580> page<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.650> got<00:05:29.650> this<00:05:29.889> idea

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
same thing next page I got this idea

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.180 
same thing next page I got this idea
from<00:05:30.880> I<00:05:32.099> don't<00:05:33.099> know<00:05:33.190> who<00:05:34.440> gave<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.500> to<00:05:35.710> her<00:05:35.949> but

I think Catherine Adam scrap beach did a

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.180 
I think Catherine Adam scrap beach did a
swap<00:05:41.349> and<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:44.139> person<00:05:44.469> who<00:05:44.500> gave<00:05:44.740> her<00:05:44.949> the
