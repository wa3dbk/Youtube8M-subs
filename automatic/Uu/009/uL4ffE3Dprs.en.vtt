tutorial but basically just like your
home<00:04:12.330> screens<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.720> use<00:04:12.900> before<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.440> use

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
home screens you use before you use

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.590 
home screens you use before you use
spark<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.550> can<00:04:14.670> swipe<00:04:14.880> left<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.270> right<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
spark you can swipe left and right to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.970 
spark you can swipe left and right to
reveal<00:04:15.810> multiple<00:04:16.260> spaces<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.739> play<00:04:16.830> some

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
reveal multiple spaces to play some

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.580 
reveal multiple spaces to play some
widgets<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.310> apps<00:04:17.840> long<00:04:18.840> tapping<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.350> blank

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
widgets and apps long tapping on a blank

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.050 
widgets and apps long tapping on a blank
area<00:04:19.890> gives<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.220> familiar<00:04:20.640> window<00:04:20.910> where

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
area gives you a familiar window where

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.280 
area gives you a familiar window where
you<00:04:21.090> can<00:04:21.150> choose<00:04:21.419> from<00:04:21.510> shortcuts<00:04:21.960> widgets

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
you can choose from shortcuts widgets

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.879 
you can choose from shortcuts widgets
and<00:04:22.380> folders

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
and folders

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.499 
and folders
just<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> normal<00:04:23.879> Android<00:04:24.360> launcher

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
just like the normal Android launcher

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.850 
just like the normal Android launcher
you<00:04:24.900> can<00:04:25.020> scroll<00:04:25.289> through<00:04:25.349> what<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.680> have

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
you can scroll through what you have

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.230 
you can scroll through what you have
available<00:04:26.009> and<00:04:26.520> place<00:04:26.669> them<00:04:26.849> on<00:04:26.939> the<00:04:26.969> screen

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
available and place them on the screen

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.420 
available and place them on the screen
of<00:04:27.270> your<00:04:27.389> choice<00:04:27.830> now<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:28.949> is<00:04:29.129> really<00:04:29.249> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
of your choice now this is really the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.369 
of your choice now this is really the
only<00:04:29.490> thing<00:04:29.939> I<00:04:30.030> have<00:04:30.180> against<00:04:30.419> spark<00:04:30.719> I'm<00:04:30.930> glad

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
only thing I have against spark I'm glad

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.839 
only thing I have against spark I'm glad
they<00:04:31.650> gave<00:04:31.770> us<00:04:31.889> a<00:04:31.979> place<00:04:32.159> to<00:04:32.189> put<00:04:32.460> widgets<00:04:32.759> and

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
they gave us a place to put widgets and

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:33.980 
they gave us a place to put widgets and
shortcuts<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.419> feel<00:04:33.629> like<00:04:33.749> it's<00:04:33.900> an

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
shortcuts but I feel like it's an

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.899 
shortcuts but I feel like it's an
afterthought<00:04:34.409> I<00:04:34.680> would<00:04:35.069> much<00:04:35.099> rather<00:04:35.310> simply

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
afterthought I would much rather simply

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.159 
afterthought I would much rather simply
be<00:04:36.029> able<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.270> swipe<00:04:36.449> left<00:04:36.659> and<00:04:36.779> right<00:04:36.930> from<00:04:37.080> my

downplay after using spark for a while I
have<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.180> say<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.419> me<00:05:06.810> don't<00:05:07.710> download<00:05:07.949> this

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
have to say for me don't download this

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.399 
have to say for me don't download this
app<00:05:08.479> sure<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.599> looks<00:05:09.779> cool<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.139> have<00:05:10.259> some

app sure it looks cool and have some
need<00:05:10.560> information<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:11.219> ultimately<00:05:11.550> this

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
need information but ultimately this

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.640 
need information but ultimately this
isn't<00:05:12.029> how<00:05:12.120> I<00:05:12.150> want<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.449> use<00:05:12.539> my<00:05:12.689> phone<00:05:12.930> now<00:05:13.620> I

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
isn't how I want to use my phone now I

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.110 
isn't how I want to use my phone now I
can<00:05:13.800> see<00:05:13.919> some<00:05:14.099> other<00:05:14.189> users<00:05:14.550> who<00:05:14.669> might<00:05:14.879> love

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
can see some other users who might love

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.670 
can see some other users who might love
this<00:05:15.330> if<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.930> don't<00:05:16.110> rely<00:05:16.319> on<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.500> ton<00:05:16.650> of

this if you don't rely on a ton of

this if you don't rely on a ton of
applications<00:05:17.310> or<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.580> want<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.759> simple
