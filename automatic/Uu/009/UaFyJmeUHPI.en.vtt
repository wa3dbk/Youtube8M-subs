00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.200
 I am your great friend of esther and good first of all this is my first video 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.190
 so rate and comment please 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.879
 now to the point 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.949
 I want to analyze and criticize a very good series and that apparently there is not what 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.619
 in two of this anime is called ónega and teacher or how would pronounce onega and 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.279
 pitcher let's start with his plot onega and teacher is a Japanese anime series 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.080
 written for it he used that kuroda and produced by the studio band di 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.499
 which was later adapted to a manga version 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.359
 the story is based on a group of friends and mysterious facts and 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.310
 strangers that happen after the arrival of a new teacher your school 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.270
 hunting mimic tunjo that is a beautiful extraterrestrial and at the same time half human 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.090
 who then marries the prota and thus continue having adventures with his 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.890
 christian husband the time keep the secret of marriage between my eyes and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.830
 what 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.810
 the animated version of ónega and teacher was broadcast in japan from 10 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.329
 January 2002 until March 28, 2002 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.640
 completing a total of 12 chapters and a work 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.140
 In my opinion this series is very good 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.729
 I think the bad thing is that nothing is perfect xd is that it was a little 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.200
 melancholic and I wish it were a little more fun and charismatic 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.440
 nor that he leaves first the happiness of others before his and that he does not 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.140
 worry so much about what they will say 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.150
 apart from that you can also say that in my opinion I never 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.570
 leave alone with my ow to fuck quiet and where they go place 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 where his friends appear at the same time neither what and he knows how to say no 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.520
 very bad thing sometimes because he believes that if for example they invite him to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 accompany them somewhere I think that if he says not to hurt his 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.990
 feelings or any other shit 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.840
 he should care about a scholarship what they think but that counteracts 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.229
 with its plot that is otherwise great but not original 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.329
 but it is also safe to have one pending in otherwise beautiful and 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.280
 that it's nice to see it and that it has echedey action plot 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.470

 I ordered them the monkey 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.249
 so that an act is carried out wherever 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:41.180

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.889

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:21.759
 let's keep going 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.769
 I was going to name the characters before viti arrived so I'm going to 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.649
 name them 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.659
 kusanagi that the protagonist of the series 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.389
 she discovers the arrival of Mituo by accident and marries her to 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.889
 protect your secret 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.079
 he suffers from a disease that causes him to faint 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.159
 which denominates ita and bone to vanish xd 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.279
 and why he remained in a kind of coma for three years in 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.370
 this state his body remained without charging to be for what he seems to have 15 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.730
 years when he really has 18 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.659
 he went to live with his uncles his uncle is a doctor since his parents do not 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.389
 they accepted and their friends as they had grown 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.510
 they looked at him like a rotten shit so he went back into high school 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.799
 in the degree to which it had vanished 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.829
 that is first grade of secondary according to the Japanese system 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.109
 Then came his beautiful and sexy wife called Mimi Fugue Hunting 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.199
 along with that kusa nagy is the protagonist of the series 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:20.940
 visitor of the space in a research mission is part human 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.650
 so he accepted this surveillance mission to know the planet of his 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.860
 father astronaut disappeared on a mission and rescued by his race despite 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.310
 everything is very naive in some aspects and as mature as the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.770
 students he teaches 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.690
 he also has a little sister called kazami majo and that at the beginning 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 is against your sister's relationship 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.729
 even going so far as to try to kill what I gave but later becomes fond of 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.180
 the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.150
 so that he even sees it later as the ideal model of what a 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.189

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.469

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.340
 but really seeks to challenge her and her daughter to reinforce the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.879
 relationship between both 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.070
 physically it is very similar to it 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.180

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.720

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:14.919
