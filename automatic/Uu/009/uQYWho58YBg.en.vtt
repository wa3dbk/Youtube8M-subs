00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.349
 as the penalty shootout is like in 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.349
 Legend has to be said and well 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.760
 I'm going to apply in this period of this 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.400
 period of time as it will be very easy if 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.960
 he throws himself where he puts now 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.750
 where will Alexander throw good 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.900
 working now going to throw in the center 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.820
 in the green it's worth to stop it and 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.290
 good and now I'll tell you if it's from 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 goat and now I'm going to tell you how it 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.190
 for a good penalty to put in a penalty 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.540
 you move it with the right joystick 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.250
 to the side you want then in this 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.909
 case I have thrown to the left and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.280
 the hostel the penalty as you see and good 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.190
 that 's all 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.330
 this is all as if it were a penalty and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 Well, in the end it was my mother 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.640
 something unforgettable the final is all the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.309
 penalty area 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.050
 and well here, Alejandro can not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.920
 stop the present presented as how 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.920
 you're good 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 it's been a bit in the verse because we've 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.650
 come to penalties there in legend there 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.650
 like the macho guys 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.150
 they are mounted closed and good here I already 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.130
 to say that I'm red and Maxwell in 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.680

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.190
