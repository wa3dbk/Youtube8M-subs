00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.400 

my<00:00:02.460> bike<00:00:02.669> won't<00:00:02.879> start<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.480> haven't<00:00:04.049> run<00:00:04.140> it<00:00:04.319> in

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
my bike won't start I haven't run it in

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.690 
my bike won't start I haven't run it in
a<00:00:04.470> month<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.920> you're<00:00:05.009> not<00:00:05.130> supposed<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.490> do

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
a month and you're not supposed to do

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.299 
a month and you're not supposed to do
that<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:05.940> guess<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:07.080> when<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.770> came<00:00:08.040> into<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
that I guess so when I came into the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.570 
that I guess so when I came into the
garage<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.670> tried<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.820> start<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:10.400> tried<00:00:11.400> to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
garage and tried to start it I tried to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700 
garage and tried to start it I tried to
like<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.000> know<00:00:12.090> 50<00:00:12.809> times<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.500> course

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
like you know 50 times and of course

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.110 
like you know 50 times and of course
every<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.309> battery<00:00:14.490> gets<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:15.030> bit

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
every time the battery gets a little bit

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.849 
every time the battery gets a little bit
lower<00:00:15.330> trying<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> try<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> didn't

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
lower trying to try it and it didn't

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
lower trying to try it and it didn't
start<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.369> then<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> tried<00:00:18.480> pushing<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
start and then I tried pushing it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
start and then I tried pushing it
compression<00:00:19.980> starting<00:00:20.400> several<00:00:20.880> times<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
compression starting several times and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.240 
compression starting several times and
now<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.960> out<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> stamina<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.949> trying<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
now I'm all out of stamina I'm trying to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.400 
now I'm all out of stamina I'm trying to
do<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> read<00:00:24.840> online<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
do that and so I read online that you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.779 
do that and so I read online that you
can<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.250> read<00:00:29.519> online<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
can is that better I read online that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
can is that better I read online that
you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.320> start<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.560> jump<00:00:31.800> throw<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you can start you can jump throw the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.459 
you can start you can jump throw the
bike<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> car's<00:00:32.910> engine<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> risk

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
bike from the car's engine but the risk

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770 
bike from the car's engine but the risk
is<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> could<00:00:34.890> damage<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.280> bikes<00:00:35.460> battery<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is it could damage the bikes battery so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
is it could damage the bikes battery so
I'm<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> jump<00:00:37.530> start<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> bike<00:00:38.100> from

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I'm going to jump start the bike from

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.470 
I'm going to jump start the bike from
the<00:00:38.340> car<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.870> happens<00:00:41.270> okay<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the car and see what happens okay so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
the car and see what happens okay so
just<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> prove<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.920> bike<00:00:44.100> doesn't

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
just to prove that the bike doesn't

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
just to prove that the bike doesn't
start<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.270> let<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> hear<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.829> not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
start and to let you hear what not

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.760 
start and to let you hear what not
starting<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> bike<00:00:48.030> sounds<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:54.770> sounds

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
starting a bike sounds like sounds

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
starting a bike sounds like sounds
pretty<00:00:56.430> crappy<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> hook

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pretty crappy so now I'm going to hook

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.609 
pretty crappy so now I'm going to hook
up<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> jumper<00:00:58.859> cables<00:01:00.410> okay<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:03.500> here's<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
up the jumper cables okay so here's the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
up the jumper cables okay so here's the
positive<00:01:04.799> terminal<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> bike<00:01:06.979> connecting

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
positive terminal of the bike connecting

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.000 
positive terminal of the bike connecting
to<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> positive<00:01:08.640> terminal<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.830> I'm

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
to the positive terminal and then I'm

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
to the positive terminal and then I'm
going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> connect<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> negative<00:01:12.060> terminal

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
going to connect the negative terminal

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
going to connect the negative terminal
to<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:15.450> frame<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> bike<00:01:17.060> as<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.240> read

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to the frame of the bike as I read

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.200 
to the frame of the bike as I read
online<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.920> will

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
online that that is going that will

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
online that that is going that will
reduce<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.600> amount<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.869> damage<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.290> could

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
reduce the amount of damage that could

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
reduce the amount of damage that could
happen<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> bikes<00:01:24.000> battery<00:01:26.509> considering

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
happen to the bikes battery considering

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
happen to the bikes battery considering
how<00:01:27.659> powerful<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> car's<00:01:28.470> battery<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
how powerful the car's battery is

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
how powerful the car's battery is
compared<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> bikes<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.500> online<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
compared to the bikes and online that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
compared to the bikes and online that
read<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.040> supposed<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> connect

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
read you're supposed to connect

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.100 
read you're supposed to connect
somewhere<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> frame<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> doesn't<00:01:33.990> have

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
somewhere to the frame that doesn't have

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.100 
somewhere to the frame that doesn't have
paint<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.360> won't<00:01:36.509> scratch<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> paint

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
paint just so it won't scratch the paint

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.429 
paint just so it won't scratch the paint
so<00:01:38.390> that's<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.840> seems<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.259> could

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
so that's the a it seems like I could

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
so that's the a it seems like I could
connect<00:01:40.770> anywhere<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.340> what's<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:42.030> good

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
connect anywhere here what's a good

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.560 
connect anywhere here what's a good
example<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.549> pull<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> positive

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
example and you do not pull the positive

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.050 
example and you do not pull the positive
terminal<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:49.130> here<00:01:50.130> straight<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
terminal off what about here straight to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.740 
terminal off what about here straight to
the<00:01:51.320> exhaust<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:53.210> don't<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.360> why<00:01:54.509> not

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the exhaust I don't see why not

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.609 
the exhaust I don't see why not
so<00:01:55.470> okay<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.070> connected<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.409> got

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so okay that's connected and now I got

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.610 
so okay that's connected and now I got
to<00:01:58.740> connect<00:01:59.180> to<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.479> car's<00:02:00.960> battery

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.850 

so<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.460> just<00:02:07.490> pulled<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> hold<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.200> jumper

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so and I just pulled the hold the jumper

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.440 
so and I just pulled the hold the jumper
cable<00:02:10.160> off<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.430> bike<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:10.850> better<00:02:11.150> move<00:02:11.300> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
cable off the bike so I better move the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.800 
cable off the bike so I better move the
car<00:02:13.000> okay<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:14.210> we<00:02:14.270> go<00:02:14.300> again

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
car okay here we go again

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.200 
car okay here we go again
I<00:02:16.360> am<00:02:17.360> reconnecting<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.370> negative<00:02:19.760> terminal
