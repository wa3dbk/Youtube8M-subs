00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
different out I do think that I take a
little<00:01:44.320> bit<00:01:44.440> more<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.800> a<00:01:44.920> leadership<00:01:45.190> role<00:01:45.400> and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
little bit more of a leadership role and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.730 
little bit more of a leadership role and
not<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.480> being<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:46.780> leader<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.200> easy<00:01:47.410> by<00:01:47.710> any

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
not that being a leader is easy by any

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.950 
not that being a leader is easy by any
means<00:01:47.980> but<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.700> pretty<00:01:48.910> confident<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.660> sure

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
means but I'm pretty confident and sure

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800 
means but I'm pretty confident and sure
of<00:01:50.260> who<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.650> am<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.220> it's<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.700> how<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.450> play

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
of who I am and it's just how we play

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:05.399 
of who I am and it's just how we play
and<00:01:53.080> how<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.650> are<00:01:53.890> off<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.250> field

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409
