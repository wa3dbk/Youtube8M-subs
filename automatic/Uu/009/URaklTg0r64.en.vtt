you'd be able to see the whole figure in

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.840 
you'd be able to see the whole figure in
package<00:02:28.170> otherwise<00:02:28.590> most<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.460> his<00:02:29.580> head<00:02:29.730> would

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
package otherwise most of his head would

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.550 
package otherwise most of his head would
get<00:02:30.060> cut<00:02:30.240> off<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.780> might<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.140> able<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.350> top
