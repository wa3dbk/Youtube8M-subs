00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
well if you get Cal fights as your task

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.240 
well if you get Cal fights as your task
you<00:02:24.659> can<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> Caliph<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.040> get

you can go to the Caliph I can you get

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.080 
you can go to the Caliph I can you get
like<00:02:26.940> 10k<00:02:27.390> XP<00:02:28.049> per<00:02:28.290> kill<00:02:28.670> now<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:29.849> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
like 10k XP per kill now would that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690 
like 10k XP per kill now would that
would<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.989> great<00:02:31.349> i<00:02:31.379> could<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.799> 99<00:02:32.190> Slayer

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
through that if i was able to get the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.890 
through that if i was able to get the
Caliph<00:02:35.069> light<00:02:35.220> test<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.569> have<00:02:36.720> any

repairing it is much cheaper to go with

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.309 
repairing it is much cheaper to go with
the<00:03:36.810> ins<00:03:36.959> rather<00:03:37.769> than<00:03:38.099> GP<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.480> repair

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
the ins rather than GP on a repair

stand with my rape years being at about
seventy<00:03:42.930> percent<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.709> looks<00:03:44.069> like<00:03:44.340> it'll<00:03:44.579> cost

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
seventy percent it looks like it'll cost

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.110 
seventy percent it looks like it'll cost
1.3<00:03:45.660> mil<00:03:45.870> coins<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.620> repair<00:03:46.919> them<00:03:47.190> versus
