00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.569
 temperatures dropped further in the south 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.820
 from brazil at dawn the snow 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.950
 Renato appeared in several cities for the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 other people 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 we are going now to one of those cities that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.260
 José is absent 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 today is the coldest day of the year on the river 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 Great Southern and there was a cold 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 carolina billy bond to carolina whats the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.410
 temperature and now in mondim now 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.450
 at this point it makes three negative degrees 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.440
 here in são josé dos absentes but 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.140
 believe the thermal sensation is 14 c 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.170
 below zero in all cities 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 Gaúcha the thermal and negative sensation 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.360
 who took away not yet but already the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 snowfall in the central region of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.739
 in a crossroads of the south in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.559
 Southern caçapava 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.719
 there was also frost registration in the city 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 Good Jesus, how are you? 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.790
 in the images the arrival of the snow enchanted 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.040
 tourists and locals 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 as we see in the report of zetti 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 padilha 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.380
 It was four hours of snow and it's Joseph. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.979
 the missing in Serra Gaucha was so 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.159
 ice covered rooftops 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 White field taken by the flakes one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.229
 scenery that looked more European is very 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.420
 Beautiful, because I was going to see this color. 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 white is very beautiful for the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.110
 landscape is the sensation is indescribable is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.659
 very good 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.270
 snow has also reached at least other 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.100
 three cities in the great southern river in 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 the most sought after region of Rio Grande do Sul 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.360
 tourists who enjoy the cold beyond 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 of the beautiful landscapes they too 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.930
 harness ambient food so 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 with the heater a comfortable chair 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.909
 and a warm soup is much more 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.460
 nice to wait for the snow 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.909
 but there are those who prefer to face in the street the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.920
 temperatures close to zero this couple 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.310
 came from são paulo and what they more 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.960
 want to enjoy this cold climate since 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.570
 child and 19 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.580
 I felt the taste of a child's dream this is 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.610
 a dream a child's dream 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.350
 And look at Santa Catarina, so much snow has fallen. 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.420

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.010
 already a 280 sc in the west of the state was 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.520
 but there is ice on the track and the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.770

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.810
 there was no snowfall 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.230
 here in the region but temperatures are 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 even lower than yesterday 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.000

 yesterday 33 cities in the state had 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.500

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.140

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.700

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.610
 be in pain 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.500

 she is in guarapuava which did not lead to 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.930
 half a century long before you arrive 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.000
 Good morning, Bahiana.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.890
 It's been here a lot in Guarapuava. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.850
 we are in the lake park post cards 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.190
 of the city 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.280
 not just a look at the lawn as it is 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.560
 is completely covered with ice everything 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.090

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 town and sale quite anyway 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.680
 a lot of people left home to come here 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.780
 now 200 kilometers from here 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.820
 guarapuava in the city of palmas also 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.880
 took the inhabitants and tourists by night 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.530
 They left home to see and feel the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.390
 snow close up here though the proof 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.150
 began to snow around nine o'clock in the 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.710
 night took for more than three hours he 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.930
 these beautiful landscapes the snow also 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.900
 caused some disorders were 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.480
 registered more than 15 accidents per 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.490
 cause of slippery slope and is what 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.500
 we will see in the article of tarcísio 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.170
 silveira 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.360
 this scene was not repeated 50 years ago in 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.790
 the snow that began to fall in the 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.580
 early in the evening was gaining momentum 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.780
 few were all covered with ice only 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.670
 I have heard many stories that 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.590
 formerly show but did not imagine that 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.350
 I could be witnessing this 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.050
 this sympathy historical invoices 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.060
 in the streets of the center of guarapuava the snow 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.640
 It was celebrated with lots of photos 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.650
 the parks will be filled with sensation 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.690
 very good snow here here the snow 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.550
 continued at dawn 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.920
 but what caused joy left 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.230
 the structure of this field of 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.320
 football did not withstand the weight of snow and 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.870
 collapsed the roof of this gym also came 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.270
 below and in this department store 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.730
 part of the roof collapsed 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.610
 no one was injured because of the snow two 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.980
 stretches of the br 277 that cuts the state of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.360
 east to west were banned from 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.270
 agreement with the federal highway police 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.640
 slippery track caused more than ten 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.340
 accidents in the region, one involving 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.490
 two cars left two people dead and 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.050
 three seriously injured 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.890
 the one in defense action arrived in são paulo 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.930
 huh 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.730
 Let's talk to izabella camargo, which one? 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.140
 It's temperature and by São Paulo now. 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.900
 isabella, good morning 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.550
 the kid rents good morning everyone is not there 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.380
 taking it here but it 's getting very cold 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.210
 today that day to put those 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.110
 warmer and heavier coats for 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.150
 walk 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.740
 we are in the south zone and how you me 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.240
 asked I brought up a thermometer 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.560
 here to see the temperature of the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.840
 moment that at this moment the thermometer 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.810
 It's scoring 11 degrees. Check it out. 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.300
 only that the thermal sensation is still of 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.680
 colder because of the drizzle and also 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.620
 because of the wind we're feeling 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.560
 the nine degrees and the maximum today will not 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.900
 of the 14 that has provoked 1 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.150
 It has been difficult to take too many 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.720
 cities as we saw in the southern region 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.030
 is a set of factors let's see two 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.550
 meteorological systems are aligned 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.710
 on the sides of south america 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.560
 areas of high pressure and low 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.900
 pressure in the opposite direction 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.600
 this forms a runner throwing air 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.980
 very cold coming from Antarctica to 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.770
 the continent 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.690
 and this time ahead came directly 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.410
 on the continent did not pass through 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.720
 Ocean 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.979
 temperatures dropped to the center 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.620
 west of the country 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.430
 in cuiabá the maximum will not exceed 16 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.830
 degrees 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.169
 already in Manaus it only looks that contrast to 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.240
 maximum can reach 36 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:24.180
 today the cold can cause a phenomenon 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.280
 known as black frost that freezes the 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.040
 plant interior in part of the river 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.520
 south of santa catarina paraná and 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.130
 south of mato grosso do sul 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.190
 looks at the last record of black frost on the 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.440
 parana was 38 years old so it can 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.479
 be joy for some tourists have 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.030
 caused too much damage for many 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:47.070
 farmers in the whole southern region 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.510
 tomorrow the weather here in sao paulo goes 

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.660
 continue very much like today's 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.000
 rainy the minimum will be only 5 degrees 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.919
 and will make sevilla latch appeared in 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.930
 where the pope will pray a mass tomorrow 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:02.100
 Wednesday to Wednesday, then it will be 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:04.229
 rainy and very cold there and today is not there 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.750
 in rio de janeiro chico and renato second 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:09.630
 The Pope's visit day will also be with 

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.240
 rain and with few sun appearances 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.340
 the maximum will be only 24 degrees thanks 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.700
 by the pope is already accustomed there to the low 

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.700
 temperature
