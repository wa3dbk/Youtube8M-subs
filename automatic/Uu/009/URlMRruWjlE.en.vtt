00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.840
 unlocked just look at it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 on the huge screen on one of the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.479
 building 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.380
 a huge case with a big one 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 eyes that was impaled on again 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 an allusion to the neversoft 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.130
 logo we'll go back to 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.020
 extension mode and to exodus map there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 where I also hide apples everywhere 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.290
 to collect all this applies to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 then properly clean up 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 if you can do it all neversoft eyes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.799
 then you find the star 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.689
 power mode is meant to be free he has all 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.250
 passive bonuses that you have in the game so 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.110
 can and the edge of the screen 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.270
 begin to shine killed enemies 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 In addition, explode into many small 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.829
 eyeballs the whole easter eggs and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.069
 Allusions to the name often are 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.760
 a nice canceled for the 20 years 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.379
 mirror developer in world of warcraft 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.989
 there is still an unresolved one 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.659
 ministry in orgrimmar of the capital 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.980
 the hood there are different big ones 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.900
 rock formations that jut into the sky 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.969
 Thousands of players fly and ride 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.620
 daily past them in one of these 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.510
 However, there is a rock 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.670
 secret why only by witches 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.650
 is reachable and out of the free 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.989
 accessible world to squeeze out 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.310
 according to wow rules punishable therefore 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.989
 we also do not show you how to do it 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 but only makes room around the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.459
 it is that is a lonely in it 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.280
 creation a plaque with the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.680
 inscription wkn and for that is up to now 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.840
 not what the whole thing should be but 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.519
 not even a player contacted times 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.319
 a gm over this plaque 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.699
 but he could also tell him for 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 the weka should arise 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.480
 probably this is about 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.340
 a kind of plaque maybe for 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.709
 a former or deceased reader 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.810
 Employee but why be so hidden 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.769
 the answer is probably only the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.769
 people at blizzard themselves 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.519

 An armor client now start 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.370
 to think about it is for 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.509
 implications on the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.519
 background story and the 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.139
 connection between the two worlds, then 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.879
