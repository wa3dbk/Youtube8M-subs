 this comet issue over winter 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.169
 It's true, it's true that we get fat at the same time that we 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.720
 the one who is in charge is the accountability 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.029
 It's true, said 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.110
 it will actually come from people to people or if you are a person who 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 you get the practice of physical activity makes an imitation rule of sec 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.929
 during the week 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.630
 this gives a little exaggeration on the weekends 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.510
 It does not come, it's not right to say. 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.750
 but if you are a person who does not practice physical activity and does 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.090
 irony during the week for a month to this will occur the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.190
 what happens is that in the summer we spend more energy because we are more 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.290
 during physical exercise 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.380
 and how they tell us how we spend a lot 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.789
 and how we do a lot of physical exercise 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.329
 what happens to you by eliminating this body fat 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.140
 excess that our body already in the winter that will happen the temperature in the 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:20.130
 body falls but grace woven after we can keep this energy see 

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:21.640
 us how much hotter 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.060
 for what we need to do and for this energy in what form 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.800
 power supply 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.520
 and that we will have to help a nutritionist to know 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.590
 as to what amount of food they have made to hurry about the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.670
 the trio was made overnight we have a country have tea 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.380
