00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello everyone with you green and this is the 26th edition 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.049
 my design show mykraft for 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 previous editions i have built huge 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 number of different houses that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 differed in style size but one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 it was always in them that they 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 were built in creative mode and always pl 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 because of this it was possible to say so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.439
 think that here I am doing some things 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.460
 maybe impractical maybe not too 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.110
 expensive and i decided to fix it and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.780
 built on the server to be more 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 exactly on the server 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.309
 the famous uses of rage one 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.129
 built my house and want and now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.250
 show and say so prove what 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 you can build beautiful houses and not in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 creative too 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.379
 and actually that's it that's it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.329
 looks i hope he doesn't look bad 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.120
 what can I say well I built it for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.970
 much longer time more than that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 could take well in creative that is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.299
 I arranged it of course with great 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 we will bury but a total of half a month 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.130
 because many resources were required 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.640
 quite voluminous but let 's 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 order 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 let's go to the first floor where we have ceremonial 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 Gagra with flowers the way I want 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 note another innovation so 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.360
 say a new idea for decor is in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 first here in appearance is the first 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.970
 strips of red so chat chat chat 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 somehow here so I will remove perhaps 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.000
 because there deliberately already quite 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.450
 got loose so and so first 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.189
 these are the strips that we have around 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 house on the first two floors 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 it is in my opinion is not so 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.940
 incredulous guys who makes the house 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.310
 more bright 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.860
 inside is one of the brightest elements from 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.619
 firstly the upper plinth and secondly 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.009
 these are kondovye pots 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.100
 occupying the whole center of our gallery and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.100
 I also want to mention small ones 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.910
 such as they stopped there before 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.709
 chat not lie so well here are my 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.650
 kind of 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.989
 I 'm still gonna show yank 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.030
 columns as we go to the left and here as 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.370
 you could already guess is 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.890
 bakery ovens are not very much but personally 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.220
 they are more than enough for me 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.430
 here i am to mrs perry burned to the right 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.500
 I have already shown this device once 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 this us trashcan throw things here here 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.560
 after which we press the button and lava 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.110
 eats all our things by the way I want 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.440
 note here above my fireplace 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.100
 kind of 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.450
 there is a homemade hood that consists 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.500
 from the top blocks as well as from the trees 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.660
 sorry for the stone fence 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.360
 Now we are going upstairs stairs here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.790
 vertical which is strong enough 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.190
 save space the second floor we did 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.650
 completely under the chests true here still 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.470
 there are no signs explaining where what but in 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.000
 principle 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.920
 quite a few knocks can be knocked 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.050
 find useful without it and i 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.610
 naturally already confused 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.930
 where what their and now what else can 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.930
 note firstly if you build 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.910
 the storage of the chests is very important that you 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.040
 need to do so to collect and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.680
 weren't just placed on the walls 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.490
 as I have in the form and it is good 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:56.730
 seen on the minimap on the right is enough 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.400
 non-standard rather standard house 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.290
 here therefore this problem is already 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.420
 was not so sharp but if you have there 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.760
 let's say a square or what a rectangular 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.060
 or triangular if such exist 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.640
 you should avoid it with the help of the columns 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.959
 Now with the help of this here well I do not know it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.480
 I have such a small imitation 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.440
 kitchen and here I have accordingly 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.600
 walks here and the beds are just for you 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.240
 naturally small place in the form 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.580
 a dining room with a balcony which by the way I want 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.410
 mark separately the balcony and balconies in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
 houses especially in wooden or even 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.330
 monophonic play the role of such an opportunity 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.419
 do something volumetric do something 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.300
 more cool and stress possible 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.310
 any profitable species though i have 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.330
 they are not particularly here 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.140
 this hefty piece of cobblestone will 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.440
 I have a farm 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.020
 there even the holiday is already growing and by the way 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.919
 one more point is another kind of columns 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.979
 that is the same we have here and the fence 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.750
 upstairs we have a ladder as well as below 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.140
 the result is quite beautiful 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.540
 one more thing is us computer 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.350
 historians consisting of top tile and 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.850
 hatches in my opinion turned out 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.390
 nice enough especially if 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.230
 to diversify this tree with a tree and 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.900
 flower pots and different 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.640
 the world sprouts here basically everything but 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.190
 if you look at the top there too 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.760
 various moments like skirting and 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.680
 the fence which also the game has 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.170
 decorative function go upstairs 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.970
 attic 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.280
 in the attic we have the most valuable things 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.560
 are this anvil is 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.820
 we have various 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.860
 alchemy items here by the way 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.230
 there is an endless source which I 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.290
 Already once showed and he intended 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.700
 in order to draw water in the flask and 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.680
 of course here we have a table 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.560
 enchantment on which we can 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.090
 accordingly, the maximum is actually 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.390
 tighten and 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:05.140
 windows window here is on a different level 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.210
 and go to different stages naturally 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.210
 a bed that I designed with a canopy 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.720
 here are such small and stressed 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.880
 on her 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.290
 roles and naturally beautiful view of 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.350
 pristine land because gone 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.380
 far enough from spawn and here's how 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.790
 would the people not so much go up 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.120
 because it was not our last 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.700
 the last floor we have is a lighthouse lighthouse i love 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.880
 build, you know that I have almost 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.830
 in each such buildings and with 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.810
 he has a beautiful view of mine 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.290
 future torch ownership at me 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.120
 they are marked and also overlook 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.210
 the roof of the house about which I am a little bit too 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.090
 I want to talk I once built a house 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.670
 with an earthen roof first if your home 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.930
 wooden then it helps to protect you 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.610
 from all kinds of lightning as well as earth no matter how 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.590
 strange enough 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.500
 bayonets beautiful material in terms of 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.629
 buildings but also want to note that 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.879
 I have here is not just a roof 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:10.419
 composite roof of two even three 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:14.800
 parts one main and 2 protruding in 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:17.949
 In principle, it is not so important however these 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.280
 bulging parts allow us to make 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:24.669
 too house pretty beautiful orders and 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.469
 neat well, well on this i think everything 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.169
 I hope you like subscribe
