00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
original XPS s of that system with that

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.999 
original XPS s of that system with that
with<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> big<00:01:22.450> screamer<00:01:22.749> motor<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.319> if<00:01:23.889> you

notice<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.600> used<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:25.929> be<00:01:26.079> cut<00:01:26.289> out<00:01:26.319> like<00:01:26.710> that

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
notice this used to be cut out like that

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:30.599 
notice this used to be cut out like that
