00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 and some everyone who has become 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.859
 boyfriend of call of duty and in this case os 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.270
 I bring an information of the zombies and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.160
 you know they have not shown yet 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.050
 practically nothing of the zombies of the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 crust is simply in a trailer that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
 They showed quite some time to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 end of that trailer you see then a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.619
 little zombie scene but 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 practically lasts two minutes and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 it looks more like a zombie and some 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.460
 behind that appears as breaking something 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.080
 what's ahead of us and a little bit more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 information about the zombies made in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.039
 the e3 many people expected it to be 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 will show a trailer or any little thing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 to give more information about the zombies 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 but it was not like that they just focused 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.090
 in the multiplayer 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.520
 does little to deal with just in the day 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 yesterday put on your twitter then put a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.149
 image of the zombies and he put that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 it's just the one I'm seeing now 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.370
 same background and puts that will be 9 of 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 July in San Diego and surely that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 here we will have the first trailer of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 zombies or more zombies information already 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.340
 that there is celebrated in San Diego the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.070
 comic-con and there's thank you because the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.329
 walking dead e different things that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.590
 they have to do with zombies because it's 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 having enough repercussion what 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 it would be all this with the zombies 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 then it would be very likely since 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 Moreover stars as you are seeing has 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 put a picture and put July 9 in 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 san diego will pass anything heart 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 and surely teach a trailer 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.440
 all the new information or something 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.630
 surely we will have just then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.250
 that day on July 9 so you have to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 be very attentive to see what we 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.330
 show I hope they show us a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 quite broad trailer, not so 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.539
 quite long and let's see how they are going to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 be the zombies how is it going to develop 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.159
 what would be a bit the movement of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.509
 the same ones and we will have the jump that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have in the multiplayer or that is 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 although it would not matter much either, since 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.179
 I have seen the jump that there is in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.740
 multiplayer of white 3 and the truth 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.020
 that I liked quite a lot 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 what we have in testing and jumping 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.050
 so I really liked it 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 very much would not be the double jump that 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.770
 we have in albany warfare so why 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.020
 that side the truth that I liked 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.460
 pretty since I did not want it to be 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 that jump as it was with warfare 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.759
 I wanted a little more because if they did 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.159
 in this way because it was like a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.960
 destiny that I get that jump 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.750
 we have there so nothing has to be 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.190
 very attentive to July 9 to see what happens 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.019
 to see that they show us surely as 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.510
 I say it will be the first trailer that we 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.870
 show zombies hopefully it will be 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.370
 A) Yes 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.379
 that we have new images new 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 information about it although it is already 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.159
 filtering enough little things that are 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 related to zombies with respect to 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.670
 drinks and quite the things that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.379
 soon you will have in the channel that 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.640
 video since I'm collecting all the 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.980
 information that is coming out of those 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.170
 zombies so that I can make a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.519
 quite extensive video in which 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.049
 I can say for a lot of information 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.940
 many new things that we are going to have 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.470
 in the new zombies you plakos three and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.970
 that in that video you have all the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.319
 information so nothing if you have 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.269
 I would appreciate very much if you vote 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.409
 the video are very attentive to the channel 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.549
 because all the information that goes 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.140
 leaving already seen the scab 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.819
 air and its well aware of zombies like 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.569
 of multiplayer so I do not expect anything 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.890
 you liked it if you liked it 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.299
 I would really appreciate it if you can do 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.470
 videos subscribe to about six for 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.190
 talk about the none and see you in 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 next goodbye
