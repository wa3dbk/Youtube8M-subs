just<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.949> draft<00:00:23.310> black<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> white

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
just do it in a draft black and white

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.339 
just do it in a draft black and white
and<00:00:24.769> I'm<00:00:25.769> using<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.099> iPhone<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.900> line<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and I'm using my iPhone and you line it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.759 
and I'm using my iPhone and you line it
up<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:30.689> automatically<00:00:31.230> recognizes

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
up like so it automatically recognizes

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.510 
up like so it automatically recognizes
it<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> start<00:00:33.239> tapping<00:00:33.600> away<00:00:34.520> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it and then you start tapping away so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
it and then you start tapping away so
I'm<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> change<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.570> angle<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I'm going to change the angle in just a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
I'm going to change the angle in just a
second<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.370> here's<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> quick<00:00:38.820> demo<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
second but here's a quick demo of just

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
second but here's a quick demo of just
showing<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.469> working<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.200> let's<00:00:49.500> see

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
showing you it working and now let's see

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.299 
showing you it working and now let's see
whether<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.480> proper<00:00:52.020> tune<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
whether we can get a proper tune out of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
whether we can get a proper tune out of
it<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.210> yeah<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.510> does<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.230> play

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

it but yeah it does I'm actually play
chords<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.520> place<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> two

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
chords as well so you can place the two

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
chords as well so you can place the two
keys<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:57.930> by<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:58.949> let's<00:00:59.160> see

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
keys at one time by the way let's see

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
keys at one time by the way let's see
what<00:00:59.760> happens<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:01.559> something<00:01:01.829> a
