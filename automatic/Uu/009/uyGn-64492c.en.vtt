00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 will sing pasku will probably can 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.080
 what else will bake something but what 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.699
 in order to bake something where 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.830
 I need eggs where I show how I separate 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.410
 yolk from squirrel because in pascu 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 it is necessary to put a lot of yolk file 234 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.690
 and even more so how fast is it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 make and how to separate the white from the yolk 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 is for once as there is an egg to but 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.110
 can and would already from cracks porridge I do not 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 so stained but how can you separate 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.690
 in this way, yes, here I take 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 half to half 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.879
 here and so quietly and I separate the yolk 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.430
 right but how would you need a little bit 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:04.739
 so this time 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:13.380
 I freaked out here and so can this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:15.650
 bottles more rumble hour work yolk 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 bad necessarily egg is not very fresh 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:29.939
 Well, here is not my problem. There is trouble. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 mine is not a fresh egg either 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 this is a fresh egg this here and says 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290
 same egg stale you see how she 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 I did not succeed one more time 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 try the egg so we are given changing 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:56.600
 stale try on this fresh egg 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.869
 see that is using a bottle 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.149
 it turns out much faster and much 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 faster here lavash were fresh eggs 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.349
 fresh egg it does not blur here 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.120
 so that's how much you can play 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.680
 make fired 10 20 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.159

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.159
