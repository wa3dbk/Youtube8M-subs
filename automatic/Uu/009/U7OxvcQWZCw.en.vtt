I<00:01:52.119> can<00:01:53.119> switch

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:03:22.060

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
seemed to work great and you switch it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.620 
seemed to work great and you switch it
extraction<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.520> want<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.820> keep<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.210> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
