00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.720
 and then people on the channel plus one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 personal video there is enrolled in the channel and 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.019
 I know that you are not registered you can also 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 there is normal good here disk like 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.590
 speak the front brake system today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.020
 the disk is in trouble 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 high speed brake 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.080
 the wheel so does the criterion side 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.619
 got a foot on the brake to step on premium 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.500
 what is the warped disc the pitying disc 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.630
 then it starts to vibrate and it brings the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 vibration the terminal direction of the carton 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 direction there was answered scroll here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 So said a lot of people today. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 would have said but depending on the price 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 compensates for turning because the prices already 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 also cheaper than ae 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 another thing is the thickness a lot of people 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.199
 change and can not see the thickness of the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.860
 disk places sharing a disc already well 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.090
 spent for that thick girl who have 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.920
 a new album here is written so only 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 follow minimal thickness speak one 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.070
 Here is the thickness of the disc 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 thickness will 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.130
 sharing on the disc I'll show it here 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:29.400
 3rd team 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 Look here look at the difference in risk 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 Thick one here. 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 thin out the car right here is this silent 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.689
 a path around here O our must 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.689
 to discount the heat is to discount the heat 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.430
 what's left of the disc's nothing left O 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.530
 there is nothing left to take the car out of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 it is here and will remain so nothing 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.149
 I will respect the minimum thickness there for 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.890
 making the replacement of the wafer beauty 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.659
 but a little video the staff connected 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 new disc brake disc inserts 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.210
 then with the replacement 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.819
 You see, that taught me how to put the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.940
 disc is part of a very thin disc and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.550
 stepped on the brake team says nothing or 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.900
