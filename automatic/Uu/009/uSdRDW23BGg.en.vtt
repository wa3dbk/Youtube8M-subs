00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.670
 This time I will do some commentary on how to make vending machines 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.940
 Even though it is well so Do'm the last of how to make 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 I wanted to make it easier to understand 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:22.510
 No Masu I first vertical 5 horizontal 3-15 Well you move to immediately explained 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.690
 I will make 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.470
 Dig this bottom of the wood or dig it below 3 squares 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.190
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.060
 I do not want to cut the cutall 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.040
 No good people 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.970
 Jar On what was told 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:49.390
 It chest in the middle of the first foremost aside 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:53.470
 Put the hopper on the chest and put the hopper on the hopper again 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:59.899
 I need some settings inside but I will do it later 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:07.870
 I put a block here, because the comparator comparator is good at the initial setting 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:10.940
 Block in front of comparator Block next to first stage hopper with block next to block 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.970
 Put their red stone powder 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.659
 Put the red stone torch here 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 I made a mistake 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.300
 And please put another rule behind it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.750
 Repeater from block here 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 Then block in the direction that the repeater is facing 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 Here it is this lamp the way I Redstone 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.000
 Do not make such of Once it was or let's break 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 It was easy to understand- I made a great deal, but it was useless , and I will continue to do it again 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.060
 A school that breaks all songs 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.490
 I wonder if I became a woman- Kame Riku bastard 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.520
 Camek 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 he 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 It's tempting to eat a steamed bun 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 Let's do Manju 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.909
 Oh Do please reflected in the early explanation 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:10.610
 If we had been a I go followed was so block Redstone next to it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.000
 So please put the block in the direction pointed by the red stone 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.380
 Put this place on it 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.230
 Finally, I will shift to the circuit where I will put out the product 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:27.430
 I If you do not finally whether I First of all, as can be seen is sold out it it's so 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.990
 Please install the dropper upward next to the area. 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:36.380
 Tail How to jump out blocks side by side pink wool in this manner 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:42.860
 Please point the comparator to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:48.620
 Red Stone Comparator Please arrange in order of Red Stone Yes this 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.540
 I only put on a red stone lamp, so only emeralds before putting on 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 Do not accept 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.430
 First of all you need to Seoul sand 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.739
 Why is it Soul Sand It is 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:08.370
 Although the top of the block of usually 1 m3 I hopper is not me taking 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.819
 But the soul sand is certainly 1/8 smaller than a normal block so the hopper will take 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.000
 is 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.000
 Well if you knew that, this is 3 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 I thought everyone knew 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 I wonder if Marisa is stupid 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 Did you say something j so much difference came 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.170
 Hmm 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.170
 In you will Arao its face 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:45.390
 Re p Lord I was Gobaku to'm correction salt three outside inn job here without having to worry about a 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.630
 Next, please drop the water on the floor as well 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:56.730
 Now we've done the most part 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:59.819
 After that, I will set the hopper and hide the circuit part. 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.129
 Let's set the hopper 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:11.999
 At first please prepare 64 pieces and 18 pieces of emeralds 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:14.310
 I will cut a little and I will not put money into the vending machine as two kinds of items 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:19.810
 Please prepare four each 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:25.690
 First of all, the lower hopper is an empty space with 64 emeralds on the left 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:30.730
 Fill one by one with other items Ueno Hopper left 28 this emerald 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:35.280
 Fill in one by one different items from the ones in the hopper that was in the vacant space 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.280
 Please do it after decoration 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:46.300
 Always Redstone signal here fancy setting is that it is normal has only 1 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:52.389
 I will put the goods next 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.700
 Not to those say their something is well-head five put the exits at one our random of them 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.920
 I will 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.550
 It is that again this time 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:05.850
 I think that the commodity basically put ANYTHING 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:10.610
 It is likely many times of replenishment I'd say even items that can not be stack 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:17.449
 Only is ok put in such a feeling Innovation Hui Hui 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:20.650
 If I put in here the kind of products that come out in Naa Chome Bege a rune not turn 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:27.340
 I think that it becomes more understandable 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:32.880
 Yes, it's getting a little bit more so let's hide various things 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.880
 Let's make it feel natural by using the blocks that were around 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.840
 me 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:50.500
 Yes I feel like this is as soon as possible, but let's buy it for trial 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:57.430
 Such is the feeling and it is a success cursory 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:59.760
 That's thinks Yano sand and the eyes and the size confirmed that seen Ha pulling a very natural lever out there 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.760
 See 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:12.139
 How far from where the vending machine came up 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:15.260
 This was made for people who do not know well because the second floor is buried 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:19.070
 Well, all the same, though 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:24.620
 This succeeded in linking 3 pieces 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.409
 There is no problem at all with 10 or 100 even if it is not especially 3 pieces 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.330
 Deha 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.330
 Let's check if it works well 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:48.300
 It was working well 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:51.840
 However, one caution is required to connect 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:57.629
 It will inform you if there are 8 products 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:02.789
 It is a circuit of red stone lamp , but if it is connected , adjacent red stone 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:05.040
 I thought that it would be connected to the torch that the powder here was 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:11.449
 I will support the repeater 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:17.389
 By doing so, you will be able to operate safely without any problems 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:22.339
 This is buried on the ground, surrounded by the surroundings and hidden in the circuit part 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:25.580
 Then it became possible to make it more compact than I thought 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:31.440
 Yes this will probably be more 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:34.490
 I think that the world has been distributed, so I'm sorry if it is good, so there is a trial listening 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.490
 Thank you very much 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.570
 Silver mark and umbrella on more arms
