00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello I am now thank you very much for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 to be here again accompanying me the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 reason why I had not uploaded video 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 is that I'm on vacation and at the time 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.380
 it's not that easy to manage in this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.450
 period 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.330
 that made me think precisely one 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.060
 word vacation and that meant 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.010
 I discovered that it comes from the Latin of a 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.869
 word that is cow because the Romans 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.150
 in the very clear that all the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.980
 they needed a time to rest and 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 relax then 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.290
 bakari was the way in which 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.290
 he called those days of going to rest 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.550
 it is supposed that in these days one relaxes 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.400
 the mind the muscles renews the desire 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.960
 to return to school or work and 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.210
 usually that's how difficult it is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.300
 keep it like this throughout the school year or 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.830
 the new stage of work but he called me 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.900
 a lot of attention and I wanted to share it 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.290
 with you some words that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.170
 they come from the same root of bacares 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.210
 they are for example vacant when there is a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.210
 vacancy injures the unforeseen vacancy and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.120
 I also remembered that but good 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.740
 vacancies is an empty place within a 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.220
 company from a job that someone can 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.470
 occupy and also the empty word that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.280
 properly, it is because there is nothing 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 there is nothing there and it can be filled with something in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 the vacation is supposed to be a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.930
 time in which nothing is done 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 properly enforced everything in order to 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.070
 relax the spirit the mind and return 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.470
 with more eagerness to work I was 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 looking for books that I would have read that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.590
 they will talk about holidays and I found 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.210
 some very funny 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.909
 the wild book by Juan Villoro 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.450
 this book was edited well at least the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.490
 edition that I read was edited for the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.380
 children who were about to enter the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 the secondary gift gave the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.540
 Sep that seemed wonderful to me because the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.430
 wild book is precisely those 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.220
 books that invite you to read talking to you 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.619
 of other books in your child juan that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.380
 she has been spending her holidays for 12 years 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.170
 in the house of one of his uncles that is something 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.450
 crazy because it never comes out has a huge 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.180
 library where he spends all the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.430
 time reading and that because he does not 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.920
 he likes nothing because he did not like it 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.340
 a lot of reading then uncle says to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.709
 john that your vacation mission 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.540
 capture the wild book that is a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.170
 book that nobody has touched anyone has read 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 and that's really magical because the uncle 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.230
 believes that this book is for Juan 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.230
 then it is juan employs all the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.110
 vacation in capturing the book in your 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 step reads other books is realizing 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.680
 that the reading is something deeper than 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.670
 what the reading campaigns say that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.730
 is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 I really liked the wild book and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.940
 I hope you have the opportunity to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.550
 read it I recommend it widely by 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.190
 three things first because it's a new 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.800
 way to start reading if you 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.750
 they still believe they need to read books 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.520
 simple this is a very simple book 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.350
 it's very fluid they're going to end up in very 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.840
 little time and the history that it contains 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.120
 It is very valuable I also recommend it 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.390
 because Juan Villoro wrote that I 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.830
 I adore it is Mexican and it is one of the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.780
 maximum representatives of letters in 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.730
 mexico I currently believe that all 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.380
 we must read juan villoro always 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.470
 his opinions seem very correct 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.390
 all the things you think about and 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.430
 of course I also recommend it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.230
 because although we are already readers of 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.750
 pink and we read the texts more 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.790
 very difficult of the world but that always 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.190
 it's good to go back to the roots and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.440
 meet with the child Juan and all the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.310
 Your uncle's library always wakes up 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.240
 emotions from there I remember when laws 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.630
 so I hope you really read it 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.220
 if you like my recommendation about 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.830
 same line I will recommend a blog 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.560
 written nothing else and good administered 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.960
 for three 11-year-old children which is 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.390
 rare to find on the internet generally 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.820
 Literary blogs are written by 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.310
 young or adults but this block is 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.740
 wonderful the opinions they make are 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.970
 very fresh are very complete also not 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.340
 they stay only in the recommendation 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.350
 but they go beyond giving data 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.560
 curious about various things and others 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.360
 recommendations then I hope that what 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.870
 can visit is called the library of 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.550
 same streets and if they go and read it and 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.270
 they say hopefully they can put what 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.160
 they knew thanks to me and well this is 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.960
 I hope that today they are in the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.130
 library of my most able to read 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.020
 the savage of juan villoro ni rest and 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.480
 frees the mind what the rest of the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.120
 vacation to come back with energy 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.530
 in school or at work and this has 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.180
 been all from me if they have 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.690
 recommendations of anything from 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.690
 words 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:00.090
 visit the comments 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.030
 if they already read minimum wild the same and 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.720
 well I hope I can upload another video 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.720
 soon 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.970
 that they pour a lot to expand a lot 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.970
 Water
