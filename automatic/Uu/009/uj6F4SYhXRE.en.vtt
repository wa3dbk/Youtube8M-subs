the bag
and<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.849> them<00:02:17.940> into<00:02:18.120> little

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
and I'm going to put them into little

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.520 
and I'm going to put them into little
blender<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:20.510> use<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> little<00:02:21.959> one<00:02:22.110> because

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
blender here I use a little one because

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.720 
blender here I use a little one because
you<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:22.950> keep<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> track<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:25.519> have<00:02:26.519> all

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can keep in a track of it I have all

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.839 
you can keep in a track of it I have all
of<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:26.970> spices<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.190> actually<00:02:29.730> I'm

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
of my spices in there and actually I'm

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.670 
of my spices in there and actually I'm
going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> take<00:02:30.269> part<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.840> out<00:02:31.049> because

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
going to take part of it out because

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.309 
going to take part of it out because
that's<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.010> little<00:02:32.129> more<00:02:32.400> than<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:33.019> think<00:02:34.019> my

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that's a little more than I think my

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.320 
that's a little more than I think my
little<00:02:34.500> mixer<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.370> handle<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.299> to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
little mixer can handle so I'm going to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.259 
little mixer can handle so I'm going to
do<00:02:36.510> two<00:02:36.750> batches<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.849> I'll<00:02:38.849> shake<00:02:39.120> them

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
do two batches and then I'll shake them

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.930 
do two batches and then I'll shake them
all<00:02:39.450> up<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.769> get<00:02:40.920> too<00:02:41.099> much<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.519> there<00:02:41.700> then

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
all up if you get too much in there then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.330 
all up if you get too much in there then
they<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.299> mushy<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> bottom<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.709> you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
they get all mushy in the bottom and you

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.729 
they get all mushy in the bottom and you
don't<00:02:44.519> want<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.959> they

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
don't want that because then it's they

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't want that because then it's they
get<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.069> little<00:02:47.220> low<00:02:47.489> damp<00:02:48.150> too<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:49.799> going

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
get a little low damp too so I'm going

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
get a little low damp too so I'm going
to<00:02:50.010> put<00:02:50.160> them<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.760> blender<00:02:51.209> here<00:02:51.450> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
to put them in my little blender here it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.430 
to put them in my little blender here it
says<00:02:52.260> chop<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.269> grind<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.019> I'm<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.260> going<00:02:55.379> to

says chop and grind so I'm just going to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.800 
says chop and grind so I'm just going to
start<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:56.010> by<00:02:56.400> chopping<00:02:56.910> effort

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440 

okay<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:03.830> finished<00:03:04.160> grinding<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.180> do<00:03:05.240> we

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
okay I just finished grinding it I do we

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.510 
okay I just finished grinding it I do we
didn't<00:03:05.600> want<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.890> listen<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.250> all

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
of the noise at this mix cuz it's pretty

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.340 
of the noise at this mix cuz it's pretty
loud<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.240> what<00:03:11.569> I'm<00:03:11.690> putting<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
loud so this is what I'm putting the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.930 
loud so this is what I'm putting the
rest<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.830> into<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.220> jar<00:03:13.730> here<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:15.940> you

rest of it into the jar here and you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.370 
rest of it into the jar here and you
have<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.240> be<00:03:17.360> careful<00:03:17.780> with<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.020> because<00:03:18.080> I

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
have to be careful with this because I

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.080 
have to be careful with this because I
did<00:03:18.560> put<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.800> chili<00:03:19.100> pepper<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.640> here

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
did put a chili pepper in here

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.330 
did put a chili pepper in here
and<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.750> turned<00:03:21.110> when<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.620> pour<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.069> here

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
and it turned when you pour it in here

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.930 
and it turned when you pour it in here
it<00:03:22.790> sort<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.180> takes<00:03:23.360> your<00:03:23.540> breath<00:03:23.750> away<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.400> you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
it sort of takes your breath away so you

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.650
