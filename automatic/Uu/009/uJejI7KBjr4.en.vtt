00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.979 
out all of the flavor and color out of
the<00:02:06.990> cherry<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.470> well<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.130> solidify<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.630> form

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the cherry as well as solidify the form

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990 
the cherry as well as solidify the form
so<00:02:10.679> rather<00:02:10.860> than<00:02:10.979> being<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.220> mushy<00:02:11.459> cherry<00:02:11.880> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so rather than being a mushy cherry it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.729 
so rather than being a mushy cherry it
had<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> nice<00:02:12.329> strong<00:02:12.870> form<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> stay<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.620> her

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
had a nice strong form that stay on her

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.500 
had a nice strong form that stay on her
further<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.519> pumped<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.910> sugars

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
further and then they pumped in sugars

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
further and then they pumped in sugars
artificial<00:02:16.200> color<00:02:16.380> artificial<00:02:17.130> flavor<00:02:17.340> in

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.440 
order to bring it back to the neon red
we<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:19.950> today<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.829> the

I'm actually doing a cocktail that was
created<00:03:01.870> by<00:03:01.960> Audrey<00:03:02.230> Saunders<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
created by Audrey Saunders to use the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.690 
created by Audrey Saunders to use the
maraschino<00:03:04.260> cherry<00:03:05.260> properly<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.280> drink

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
maraschino cherry properly in the drink

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.420 
maraschino cherry properly in the drink
it's<00:03:07.030> called<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.690> Little<00:03:07.930> Italy<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:09.160> start

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it's called the Little Italy we start

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:20.070 
it's called the Little Italy we start
out<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:10.840> two<00:03:11.470> ounces<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:12.010> rye<00:03:12.280> whiskey

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.900 

3/4<00:03:21.080> ounce<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.680> sweet<00:03:21.860> vermouth

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:39.200 

and<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.720> 1/2<00:03:31.840> ounce<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.560> gin<00:03:32.740> are

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.000 

as<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.780> see<00:03:39.930> there's<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.260> fair<00:03:40.560> amount<00:03:40.860> of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
as you can see there's a fair amount of

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530 
as you can see there's a fair amount of
similarity<00:03:41.430> between<00:03:41.490> this<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> Manhattan

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
similarity between this and a Manhattan

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
similarity between this and a Manhattan
but<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> Manhattan<00:03:43.620> doesn't<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.130> chena

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
but the Manhattan doesn't have the chena

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.310 
but the Manhattan doesn't have the chena
and<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> chi<00:03:45.000> gnar<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.180> adding<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> bitter

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
and the chi gnar is adding the bitter

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.260 
and the chi gnar is adding the bitter
flavor<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.220> Angostura<00:03:47.730> bitters<00:03:48.060> would

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
flavor of that Angostura bitters would

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.480 
flavor of that Angostura bitters would
add<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.410> being<00:03:49.740> a<00:03:49.950> bitters

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
add to it but it's not being a bitters

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.700 
add to it but it's not being a bitters
it's<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> bitter<00:03:51.690> liqueur<00:03:52.200> instead

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
it's just like a bitter liqueur instead

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:25.550 
it's just like a bitter liqueur instead
now<00:03:53.640> we're<00:03:53.730> gonna<00:03:53.820> stir<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.210> with<00:03:54.360> ice<00:04:24.560> I'm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
now we're gonna stir this with ice I'm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:35.410 
now we're gonna stir this with ice I'm
gonna<00:04:25.740> strain<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.070> into<00:04:26.580> our<00:04:26.730> cocktail<00:04:27.090> glass

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.050

now before we add our garnish I'm

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.640 
now before we add our garnish I'm
actually<00:04:39.270> going<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.540> take<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.870> jar<00:04:40.140> of
