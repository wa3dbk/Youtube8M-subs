a<00:03:44.989> fee<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.769> can't<00:03:45.980> really<00:03:46.100> say<00:03:46.340> much<00:03:46.370> more

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
a fee so I can't really say much more

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.610 
a fee so I can't really say much more
about<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:47.180> because<00:03:47.389> that<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.049> pretty<00:03:48.440> much

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
about this because that is pretty much

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.740 
about this because that is pretty much
everything<00:03:49.069> we<00:03:49.100> know<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.030> will<00:03:50.239> say<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.540> I

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
everything we know but I will say that I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.360 
everything we know but I will say that I
think<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.200> looks<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.500> lot<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.859> fun<00:03:52.069> and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
think it looks like a lot of fun and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.099 
think it looks like a lot of fun and
that's<00:03:52.670> probably<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.120> most<00:03:53.269> important<00:03:53.810> thing

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
that's probably the most important thing

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.750 
that's probably the most important thing
it's<00:03:54.410> pretty<00:03:54.799> impressive<00:03:55.040> how<00:03:55.340> Blizzard<00:03:55.700> or

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it's pretty impressive how Blizzard or

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.030 
it's pretty impressive how Blizzard or
just<00:03:55.970> adding<00:03:56.269> even<00:03:56.569> more<00:03:56.750> content<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.799> the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
just adding even more content and the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.170 
just adding even more content and the
good<00:03:58.190> thing<00:03:58.220> about<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.940> it's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
good thing about this is that it's

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.940 
good thing about this is that it's
content<00:03:59.599> that<00:03:59.750> won't<00:03:59.930> just<00:04:00.170> get<00:04:00.290> old<00:04:00.530> as<00:04:00.799> you

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
content that won't just get old as you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.620 
content that won't just get old as you
level<00:04:01.160> people<00:04:01.819> will<00:04:01.940> probably<00:04:02.329> still<00:04:02.599> be

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
level people will probably still be

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.539 
level people will probably still be
coming<00:04:02.989> back<00:04:03.139> here<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:03.829> as<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> said

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
coming back here just because as I said

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.860 
coming back here just because as I said
it's<00:04:04.819> going<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.030> be<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> lot<00:04:05.299> of<00:04:05.329> fun<00:04:05.630> and

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
it's going to be a lot of fun and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.360 
it's going to be a lot of fun and
they'll<00:04:06.319> always<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.530> rewards<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.190> all<00:04:07.340> i

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
they'll always be rewards that all i

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.210 
they'll always be rewards that all i
would<00:04:07.730> say<00:04:08.209> timeless<00:04:08.810> hear<00:04:09.079> things<00:04:09.799> like<00:04:09.919> the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
would say timeless hear things like the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.190 
would say timeless hear things like the
old<00:04:10.370> sets<00:04:10.730> they<00:04:11.239> can<00:04:11.269> just<00:04:11.569> keep<00:04:11.690> adding<00:04:11.900> new

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
old sets they can just keep adding new

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.930 
old sets they can just keep adding new
ones<00:04:12.230> there<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:12.799> they<00:04:12.980> had<00:04:13.069> expansions<00:04:13.700> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
ones there as they had expansions and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.000 
ones there as they had expansions and
the<00:04:14.269> previous<00:04:14.599> expansion<00:04:15.019> sets<00:04:15.290> get<00:04:15.500> old<00:04:15.709> if

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
the previous expansion sets get old if

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.920 
the previous expansion sets get old if
you<00:04:16.519> know<00:04:16.669> what<00:04:16.789> I'm<00:04:16.880> saying<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.359> my<00:04:17.750> opinion
