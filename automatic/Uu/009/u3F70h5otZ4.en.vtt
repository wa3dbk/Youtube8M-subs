hello I'm Abbi I'm going to show you how

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.730 
hello I'm Abbi I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.790> protect<00:00:07.210> your<00:00:07.569> bindings<00:00:08.049> and<00:00:08.290> finish<00:00:08.590> the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
to protect your bindings and finish the

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.010 
to protect your bindings and finish the
back<00:00:08.889> of<00:00:09.010> your<00:00:09.129> dress<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.510> start<00:00:10.809> with<00:00:10.990> a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
back of your dress so you start with a

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.930 
back of your dress so you start with a
keyhole<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.740> you<00:00:11.860> take<00:00:12.099> the<00:00:12.219> pressed<00:00:12.490> binding

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
keyhole and you take the pressed binding

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.299 
keyhole and you take the pressed binding
that<00:00:13.750> you've<00:00:13.900> already<00:00:14.080> done<00:00:14.259> and<00:00:14.650> the<00:00:15.160> one

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
that you've already done and the one

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.130 
that you've already done and the one
that<00:00:15.490> is<00:00:15.610> marked<00:00:15.849> keyhole<00:00:16.390> binding<00:00:16.779> it's<00:00:16.990> the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
that is marked keyhole binding it's the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.979 
that is marked keyhole binding it's the
shortest<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:19.090> can<00:00:19.270> start<00:00:19.540> at<00:00:19.660> either<00:00:19.810> the

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:19.989 
shortest you can start at either the

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.569 
shortest you can start at either the
left<00:00:20.290> or<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.590> right<00:00:20.619> side<00:00:21.009> whichever<00:00:21.399> is

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
left or the right side whichever is

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.790 
left or the right side whichever is
comfortable<00:00:21.790> for<00:00:22.119> you<00:00:22.329> the<00:00:23.110> idea<00:00:23.410> is<00:00:23.560> that<00:00:23.590> you

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
comfortable for you the idea is that you

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.650 
comfortable for you the idea is that you
would<00:00:23.919> literally<00:00:24.220> make<00:00:24.430> a<00:00:24.489> sandwich<00:00:24.910> the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
would literally make a sandwich the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.929 
would literally make a sandwich the
binding<00:00:26.110> should<00:00:26.290> go<00:00:26.439> under<00:00:26.770> and<00:00:27.099> over<00:00:27.250> with

binding should go under and over with
the<00:00:28.059> fabric<00:00:28.480> pressed<00:00:28.869> up<00:00:29.050> right<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.739> the

you turn to keep everything in place

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.060 
you turn to keep everything in place
you'll<00:00:52.900> be<00:00:53.050> able<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.320> feel<00:00:53.560> the<00:00:53.680> thicknesses

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
you'll be able to feel the thicknesses

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.710 
you'll be able to feel the thicknesses
of<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.280> fabric<00:00:54.520> and<00:00:54.880> if<00:00:55.360> you're<00:00:55.510> wobbling

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
of a fabric and if you're wobbling

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.170 
of a fabric and if you're wobbling
around<00:00:55.989> so<00:00:56.860> this<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> maneuver<00:00:57.760> quite

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
around so this is a maneuver quite

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.990 
around so this is a maneuver quite
delicate<00:00:58.470> take<00:00:59.470> it<00:00:59.650> slowly<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.220> use<00:01:00.850> your

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
delicate take it slowly and use your

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.499 
delicate take it slowly and use your
fingers<00:01:03.299> put<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.390> under<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.750> machine<00:01:05.079> I<00:01:06.509> put

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
fingers put it under the machine I put

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.030 
fingers put it under the machine I put
it<00:01:07.600> onto<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.840> machine<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.440> get<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.740> first

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
it onto the machine to get the first

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.160 
it onto the machine to get the first
once<00:01:09.970> you've<00:01:10.180> positioned<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.690> very<00:01:10.900> first

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
once you've positioned the very first

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.200 
once you've positioned the very first
few<00:01:11.380> centimeters<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.920> can<00:01:12.190> start<00:01:12.490> using<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
few centimeters you can start using the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.630 
few centimeters you can start using the
machine<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.690> help<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:15.159> people<00:01:15.460> might

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
machine to help you some people might

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.850 
machine to help you some people might
feel<00:01:15.820> more<00:01:16.030> comfortable<00:01:16.360> by<00:01:16.630> pinning<00:01:17.350> but<00:01:17.830> I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
feel more comfortable by pinning but I

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.410 
feel more comfortable by pinning but I
would<00:01:18.100> not<00:01:18.190> recommend<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.729> for<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.000> because

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
would not recommend it for this because

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.180 
would not recommend it for this because
you<00:01:19.570> have<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.380> gently<00:01:20.650> stretch<00:01:21.159> the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
you have to have to gently stretch the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.539 
you have to have to gently stretch the
binding<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.450> go<00:01:22.600> around<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.930> keyhole<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
binding as you go around the keyhole so

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.310 
binding as you go around the keyhole so
I'm<00:01:24.700> going<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.909> stop<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.210> machine<00:01:25.540> now<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:26.170> I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
I'm going to stop the machine now and I

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.899 
I'm going to stop the machine now and I
always<00:01:26.590> start<00:01:26.890> by<00:01:27.100> going<00:01:27.280> forwards<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.880> little

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
always start by going forwards a little

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.120 
always start by going forwards a little
bit<00:01:28.240> backwards<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.810> forwards<00:01:29.140> again<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.920> find

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
bit backwards and forwards again to find

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
bit backwards and forwards again to find
the<00:01:30.250> edge

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.420 

there<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:34.960> are<00:01:34.990> then<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.980> make<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
there we are then you you make the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.340 
there we are then you you make the
sandwich<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.450> curve<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.810> your<00:01:37.840> hand<00:01:38.110> as

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
sandwich in the curve of your hand as

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.650 
sandwich in the curve of your hand as
you<00:01:38.470> go<00:01:38.620> round<00:01:38.650> your<00:01:39.640> fingers<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.360> all<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
you go round your fingers do all the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.660 
you go round your fingers do all the
work<00:01:40.840> here<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.830> need<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.100> feel<00:01:42.400> from

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
work here and you need to feel from

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.880 
work here and you need to feel from
under<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.210> over<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:44.320> staying<00:01:44.620> in

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
under and over that it's staying in

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.530 
under and over that it's staying in
alignment

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.940 

if<00:01:50.540> you're<00:01:50.720> confident<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:51.410> all<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.710> place

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
if you're confident it's all in place

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.110
