to call it a rumor because it was an

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
official Blizzard post on the forums but

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
official Blizzard post on the forums but
at<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.210> point<00:00:21.510> there's<00:00:21.779> nothing<00:00:21.930> finalized

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
at this point there's nothing finalized

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.990 
at this point there's nothing finalized
so<00:00:22.830> hopefully<00:00:23.279> they'll<00:00:23.609> come<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> their

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so hopefully they'll come to their

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
so hopefully they'll come to their
senses<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.840> through<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.350> I'm

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
senses and not go through with it I'm

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.259 
senses and not go through with it I'm
probably<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.609> tons<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> hay<00:00:27.090> bale

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.160 
probably going to get tons of hay bale
and<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> guys<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> tell<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.050> how

and you guys are going to tell me how

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
and you guys are going to tell me how
much<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.590> suck<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.490> thinking<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
much I suck for thinking that way but I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
much I suck for thinking that way but I
do<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.779> whole<00:00:30.960> point<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> game<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
do the whole point of the game is you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
do the whole point of the game is you
you<00:00:32.189> buy<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> game<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.390> pick<00:00:33.600> hoarder

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you buy the game you pick hoarder

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
you buy the game you pick hoarder
Alliance<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> PVE<00:00:35.190> server<00:00:35.309> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
Alliance if you're on a PVE server you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850 
Alliance if you're on a PVE server you
can<00:00:35.790> pick<00:00:36.120> Bowl<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.469> don't<00:00:37.620> think

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
can pick Bowl but I just don't think

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
can pick Bowl but I just don't think
it's<00:00:38.010> fair<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.610> level<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it's fair that you can level up as the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
it's fair that you can level up as the
torrent<00:00:39.809> drew<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.590> paste<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
torrent drew it and then just paste the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.130 
torrent drew it and then just paste the
money<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.270> become<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> night<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.020> they

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
money and then become a night off they

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.750 
money and then become a night off they
have<00:00:43.260> totally<00:00:43.680> different<00:00:43.770> racial<00:00:44.190> skills

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
have totally different racial skills

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.700 
have totally different racial skills
it's<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.260> unfair

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it's just it's very very unfair

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
it's just it's very very unfair
especially<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.399> you're<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.149> server<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
especially if you're on a server that is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
especially if you're on a server that is
horde<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.039> alliance<00:00:50.210> dominated<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
horde or alliance dominated because it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
horde or alliance dominated because it
will<00:00:51.600> obviously<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:52.050> easier<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> quest<00:00:52.890> if

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
will obviously be easier to quest if

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
will obviously be easier to quest if
there's<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.910> faction<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
there's more of your faction and then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
there's more of your faction and then
you<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> transfer<00:00:56.610> over<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you just get to transfer over it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
you just get to transfer over it's
really<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.149> fair<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
really not fair if they are going to go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.900 
really not fair if they are going to go
through<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.309> should<00:00:59.340> definitely

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
through with it they should definitely

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
through with it they should definitely
come<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:00.449> difficult<00:01:00.750> quest<00:01:01.320> line

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
come up with a very difficult quest line

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.090 
come up with a very difficult quest line
maybe<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.420> makes<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> become<00:01:03.930> hated<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
maybe that makes you become hated with a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
maybe that makes you become hated with a
faction<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.790> exalted<00:01:06.299> whether<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.630> few

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
faction that your exalted whether a few

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
faction that your exalted whether a few
fashion<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.530> every<00:01:07.890> faction<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.460> exalted

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
fashion or every faction your exalted

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.149 
fashion or every faction your exalted
but<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.360> matter<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.380> something<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> don't

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
but for that matter or something I don't

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.500 
but for that matter or something I don't
know<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> should<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
know and then I think you should have a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.260 
know and then I think you should have a
permanent<00:01:12.930> title<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.640> pants<00:01:15.150> are

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
permanent title that is like pants are

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.690 
permanent title that is like pants are
born<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> traitor<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.470> Benedict<00:01:17.040> pancer

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
born the traitor or Benedict pancer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
born the traitor or Benedict pancer
because<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.680> fair<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
because it's just really not fair that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
because it's just really not fair that
you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.430> pay<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.909> money<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you can just pay some money and just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
you can just pay some money and just
change<00:01:21.750> everything<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.680> I'm<00:01:22.920> very

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
change everything it's it's I'm very

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
change everything it's it's I'm very
against<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.299> whole<00:01:24.540> idea<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.990> didn't<00:01:25.290> really

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
against this whole idea I didn't really

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.109 
against this whole idea I didn't really
believe<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.860> until<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.220> read<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.729> forms

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
believe it until I read it on the forms

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
believe it until I read it on the forms
myself<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.710> release<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.430> it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
myself if they do release this it's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.080
