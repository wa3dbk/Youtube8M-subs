first<00:03:13.980> kit<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:16.580> yeah<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.730> DIY<00:03:18.150> there's<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
first kit but yeah the DIY there's the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.610

reversed<00:03:19.920> actually<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.550> what<00:03:20.640> I'm

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
reversed actually that's what I'm

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.290 
reversed actually that's what I'm
thinking<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.000> DIY<00:03:21.600> has<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.300> die-cutting

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
thinking the DIY has the the die-cutting

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.690 
thinking the DIY has the the die-cutting
machine<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> fact<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> starter

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
machine in it that fact but the starter

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.330 
machine in it that fact but the starter
kit<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.240> what<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.380> without<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.190> can

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
kit is what is it without so you can

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.890 
kit is what is it without so you can
save<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.730> sixty<00:03:30.120> dollars<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.750> already

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
save that sixty dollars if you already

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.750
