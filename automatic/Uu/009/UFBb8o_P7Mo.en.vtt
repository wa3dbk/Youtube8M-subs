 "The Bad Way to Increase Serotonin" 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.020
 Recent studies, like this, suggest that eating habits involve 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.889
 high intake of vegetables, fruits, mushrooms and soy products 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.799
 are associated with a lower incidence of depressive symptoms. 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 A year ago it was this study: 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.520
 "Connection between eating habits and mental health in early adolescence", 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.310
 that has shown improvement in behavior scores ... 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.990
 significantly associated with higher intake of green leafy vegetables 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.920
 and fresh fruits. 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.230
 It could be because 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.970
 psychoactive substances that occur in plant foods? 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.520
 It occurs in plant foods 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.070
 neurotransmitter serotonin, 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 often referred to as "happiness hormone". 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.070
 However, serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier. 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.840
 So it shouldn't affect our mood, no matter how much we consume it. 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.690
 The precursor of serotonin, the substance from which our body produces serotonin, 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 is an amino acid called tryptophan. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.290
 And there is a transport protein in the brain that takes up tryptophan 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.549
 from the bloodstream, and therefore what you consume, 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.069
 it can eventually affect your mood. 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.469
 Experiments on tryptophan depletion were conducted in the 1970s 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.220
 where people were given a special diet with tryptophan deficiency. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 And the people's mood really suffers. 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 They are irritated, agitated, angry, depressed. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.920
 Their body simply cannot produce enough serotonin. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 Just so you can give people tryptophan pills to improve your mood. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.759
 And indeed they have become a favorite dietary supplement - 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.399
 until people have started dying of something called eosinophilic myalgia, 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.139
 incurable, debilitating, and sometimes fatal, flu-like neurological disease 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.649
 caused by the use of tryptophan supplements. 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.219
 Could be due to some unknown dirt 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.460
 but it is better to be overly cautious than to regret it later. 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.619
 Instead of supplements exist 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.499
 diet strategies that can be used to improve mood 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.489
 and we'll talk about it next time.
