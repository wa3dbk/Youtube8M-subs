00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.350
 good roommates 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.620
 Welcome 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.370
 today we are going to see a small video about 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.250
 of a chapucilla that 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.250
 I saw in a hunting book with an arc 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.360
 and good was a pretty solution 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.680
 ingenious 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.240
 and sharpen the tips of big game 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.620
 what we use in 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.660
 in hunting with bow the tips of casamayor 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.030
 for those who have never seen 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.450
 none are so that you notice that edge 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.670
 This is two blades 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 good and there are some 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 of three blades four blades two 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.220
 blades with good bleeder this is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.170
 a satellite 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.230
 titan satellite good that that the tips 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.180
 because they are still triangles with the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:12.010
 Sharp edges to provoke 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.930
 death by blood of the animal 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.000
 obviously, some of them 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.590
 they are impregnated very careful with 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 this with liquids anti caute antel and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.740
 scarring or that it may be that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.070
 we hit a cut and the wound is not 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.070
 closing 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.100
 If you look not know if you see here is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.800
 stitched are eight points then precisely 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 because 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.820
 hit me a long time ago and I did not 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.460
 the wound closed then careful 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 very careful with that because there are some 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 that I already tell you that they are impregnated in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.880
 with anticoagulants 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.310
 good the case to sharpen this when 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.400
 is very used when it is not the case 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 but when spain when they are already 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.560
 quite used because it seems that not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.860
 but the tips based on crossing 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.010
 animal skin especially in wild boars 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.930
 that the cap is formed that after the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.150
 winter fur because they tend to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.770
 dulling and then disaffiliating 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 tip would not penetrate with the force that 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.819
 has to penetrate and it could be that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.610
 let's leave the injured animal and this is what 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.650
 that really does not interest us then 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.940
 to sharpen this you will tell me how 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.300
 we make 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.270
 Well, in the East book that I tell you about 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.210
 Mr. Synthesis of Javier Sintes was coming 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.870
 a kind of rig made by him 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.620
 same and that I found very curious here 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.650
 we have two examples 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.409
 and now forgive and now I will explain a 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.010
 little what this rig consists of 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.970
 it's nothing more than a piece of 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 wooden railing vale 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.670
 and with some numbers on each side 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.140
 has two faces there has four faces 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.380
 Well, in each one a number because 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.420
 this will help us to know what the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.980
 face that we are sharpening 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:22.209
 when it comes to sharpening 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.569
 the roll the hunting tips usually 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.629
 they have a thread that gets into the 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.230
 arrow shank and that shank to your 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:36.430
 once it takes a piece called adapter 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.879
 gps this adapter the gps is nothing more 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.269
 than a cylinder with one with a thread that 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.459
 is universal universal for this kind of 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.659
 arrows or is there for this kind of 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.080
 tips almost all hunting tips 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.230
 come with this thread system 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.640
 and what we have done is 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.250
 take a fps adapter here you see it not 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.629
 You can see very well but good 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.880
 you have to pull me whoever you are 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.590
 Archers you know what I'm talking about 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.150
 we have drilled the base with this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.150
 we have put the gps adapter with 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.829
 glue 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.829
 and the only thing we have to do 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.669
 as you can see it is threaded 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:38.820
 for example we leave it in 2 and 4 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.870
 we are left with such 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.870
 and with this 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.710
 we can already with a diamond sharpener and 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.370
 even by hand ok let's put it in 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.980
 the screw and fasten it on the screw and 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.110
 then already with the guide it does not go 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.620
 they sold me this aparatejo that 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.650
 I've never used the typical of I do not know if 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.689
 will work or will not work for 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.989
 emergencies imagine that yes good 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:15.200
 The good thing about this system is that if 

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:18.170
 we have a knife 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.210
 and a spare gps adapter what 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.690
 We can manufacture in situ in the field with 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.540
 a piece of stick or obviously has 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.490
 to be of a diameter a bit like that but 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.460
 we can find it in the same 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.169
 field in case we had to sharpen what 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.180
 because there are circumstances 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.610
 this is more than anything because we are going to 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.990
 have in the workshop and before doing 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.849
 a hunting trip because I'm going to have the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.590
 the arrows or the arrowheads 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.819
 of big game in perfect condition 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.039
 good magazine, maybe we think it's very 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.039
 for there but good to me 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:59.490
 particularly in his day then he made me 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.129
 the service and I think it's good that it's a 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.039
 thing to keep in mind and I tell you that 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:08.629
 As you can see, it has no secret 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.629
 nothing friends a hug
