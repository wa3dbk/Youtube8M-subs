00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.090
 install the minecraft a mode that is 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.849
 pretty funny that we are behind 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.560
 fucking accessories if I do not either 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.269
 I'm going to create that new one in him and good 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.079
 I'll leave it in the description of 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.390
 I'm going to leave it in a video 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.110
 the alix video that shows you how it is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.770
 the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.520
 the mode and good and also I'm going to leave it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.520
 what it is 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.240
 to download what they have to 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.000
 do is download where it says here 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.000
 12-point model 2.5 degrees 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.019
 it will not lead to mediafire what 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.019
 we are going to give you download 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.130
 and well now we are going to give you 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.720
 desktop and let's save me not what 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.230
 I'm going to make a brush 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.220
 and 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.220
 I already have it 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.650
 as you see here I have it and what we are going with 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.830
 to do with this this mode let's go to 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.890
 the minecraft folder 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.360
 and we're going to put in the start percent 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 to see life is percent 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.859
 and very difficult is that of windows xp 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 they will have here to execute and they will 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.280
 to be able to enter and put them 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 hundred properties and it's going to be able 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.580
 they will have the roaming folder that is the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.320
 same 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.320
 good now let's minecraft 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.580
 you 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.090
 and the model that we are going to make we are going to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.090
 copy to the folder 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.550
 and now they're going to go into minecraft and they 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.570
 they are going to fix the mode I already told you a lot 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.570

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.160
