00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello how about some pretty people this time 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.580
 I'm going to show you how you can do this 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 decoration for the Christmas tree 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.040
 these can similar that is like a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.550
 twigs 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.980
 ok it really looks very nice in the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.470
 Christmas tree if you want you can 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.369
 put a little more and you're going to do the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.220
 effect of having more more twigs and 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.740
 Well, nothing we are going to need 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.700
 this 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.820
 We're going to need four clean pipes 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.190
 golden color if you do not have gold you can 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.050
 occupy another color only I'm you 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.780
 showing how the color is 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.330
 occupying and we will occupy another one from another 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.970
 color this is like a cherry type or 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:56.550
 rosita I do not know ok it 's like this good 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.550
 Quickly we will need 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.059
 let's do the following to this we go 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 to grab two clean pipes and the only thing 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.800
 what are we going to do is we're going to do 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:16.330
 this is going to cross strong I like 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.100
 clean pipes because we can handle it 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.890
 because he has a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.159
 to hunger very thin and is flexible 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.790
 then we doubled and we are left like this 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.420
 that and then I do not know right now we can occupy 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.290
 this and we do the same to him we are going to pass 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.300
 and we're going to double it ok and we have to 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 to be like this more or less like that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.280
 this we can double as you want 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.909
 more or less like that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 ok and with this one here to make it a 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.050
 little bit more resistant the stick we are going to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.650
 roll it here 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.650
 A) Yes 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 so we have to go and it is that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 we are putting it up 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.120
 nothing else we fold here and it 's so that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.720
 stay a little more here we give you a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.170
 vueltita with another that we have 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.090
 so and so we have the twig 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.000
 ok and now we're going to need 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.000
 this if you have pompoms you can put 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 the pom-poms if not then you alone 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.069
 we are going to occupy this what we are going to 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.660
 to do is that we're going to fold him here like this 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.430
 we are going to support with our finger like this 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:51.020
 and we are going to do this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.530
 so let's make a little circle 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.530
 so and let's cut 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.860
 and these will do what we 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.780
 that reach us from clean pipes 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.960
 if you want to make it smaller, more 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.970
 great is how you want I tell you if you 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.630
 You can also buy the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 pompoms that already come as well as with this 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.350
 type also 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.770
 and if not then so but it is very economical 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.090
 if you want to do and to make it look 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.410
 beautiful your tree you can do many and you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.440
 you are going to give that special touch to the tree 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.560
 then sometimes it is not necessary to buy 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.960
 the most expensive to look nice when 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.820
 Well, what can you do at home? 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.180
 be a craft also with your children 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.730
 or with someone from the house ok 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.190
 well now what we are going to do is that 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.580
 let's grab the cold silicone and 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.680
 we are going to paste these now for all 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.070
 the twigs where you want does not have a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.740
 order is how you go seeing where 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.420
 paste them ok 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.420
 let's put one here 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.569
 and another is on the side 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:24.020
 It is very easy and fast 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.540
 well since we have this like this now what 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.860
 what are we going to do is we 're going to grab 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.550
 glue ok and we're going to put a 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.550
 little here 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.110
 that way 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.800
 just a little bit about him cleans pipe 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.820
 this is to put a little bit of 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.820
 diamond 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:04.050
 and give us another touch to the clean pipe 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.050
 what 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.270
 so we 're going to go good as we have 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.900
 this now let's grab I do not know 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.620
 is the diamond you can buy it in 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.660
 stationers and you can put it depending 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.420
 of the color that is your tree if it is that 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.180
 you want as well as the people that what 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.510
 They have one color or decoration 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.910
 of a single color so you can grab the 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.250
 diamond and decorate it in this color ok 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.880
 I'm going to grab this color as it is 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.579
 like a green because and now we're going to 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.089
 sprinkle where we spend with him 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.089
 gay resistol 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.990
 and this is going to give us another effect and also 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.990
 it will shine more 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.890
 here 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.870
 let's shake a little to take away the 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.870
 excess 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:24.990
 and here they have their clean twigs 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:29.400
 pipes is very easy very nice 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.870
 ok look, I'll show you how 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.870
 you have to put 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.870
 quickly 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.810
 since we have this now you can 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:48.700
 put it we assume here in your tree and 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:53.300

 give your tree another touch in life 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.490
 they look like branches 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.260
 then you see you do not need to spend 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.300
 a lot so that the tree looks nice already 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.130
