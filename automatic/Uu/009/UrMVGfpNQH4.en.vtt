so<00:00:06.520> that<00:00:06.880> is<00:00:07.149> basically<00:00:07.180> this<00:00:07.990> one<00:00:08.230> in<00:00:08.410> a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
so that is basically this one in a

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.580 
so that is basically this one in a
nutshell<00:00:08.770> and<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:10.360> instructions<00:00:11.139> on<00:00:11.350> this

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
nutshell and the instructions on this

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.949 
nutshell and the instructions on this
are<00:00:11.860> fairly<00:00:12.400> adequate<00:00:12.969> they<00:00:13.389> may<00:00:13.570> be<00:00:13.629> a<00:00:13.750> little

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
are fairly adequate they may be a little

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.289 
are fairly adequate they may be a little
bit<00:00:14.230> lacking<00:00:15.100> in<00:00:15.219> certain<00:00:15.430> areas<00:00:15.670> that<00:00:16.029> I<00:00:16.059> was

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
bit lacking in certain areas that I was

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.150 
bit lacking in certain areas that I was
able<00:00:16.390> to<00:00:16.570> get<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.810> job<00:00:16.990> pulled<00:00:17.350> off<00:00:17.560> without<00:00:17.770> a

able to get the job pulled off without a
big<00:00:18.400> issue<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:20.080> then<00:00:20.470> moving<00:00:20.710> into<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.220> salt

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
big issue and then moving into the salt

a<00:00:41.590> little<00:00:42.040> description<00:00:42.399> on<00:00:42.700> how<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.940> copper

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
a little description on how the copper

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.990 
a little description on how the copper
and<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.110> chlorine<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.770> generated<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
and the chlorine is generated and it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.150 
and the chlorine is generated and it
came<00:00:49.450> with<00:00:49.720> enough<00:00:49.989> fittings<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.829> set

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
came with enough fittings to set

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.200 
came with enough fittings to set
everything<00:00:51.399> up<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:53.200> that<00:00:53.410> was<00:00:53.559> quite<00:00:53.770> nice<00:00:54.210> now

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
everything up so that was quite nice now

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.319 
everything up so that was quite nice now
on<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.600> there<00:00:55.960> they<00:00:56.260> get<00:00:57.010> into<00:00:57.190> volumes<00:00:57.880> you

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
on the there they get into volumes you

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.020 
on the there they get into volumes you
know<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:58.960> how<00:00:59.290> much<00:00:59.440> pool<00:00:59.800> salt<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.850> need

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
know on on how much pool salt you need

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.249 
know on on how much pool salt you need
to<00:01:01.149> add<00:01:01.890> based<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.190> their<00:01:03.460> pools<00:01:03.850> well<00:01:04.719> my<00:01:04.960> pool

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
to add based on their pools well my pool

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.830 
to add based on their pools well my pool
is<00:01:05.590> not<00:01:05.740> listed<00:01:06.070> in<00:01:06.340> this<00:01:06.549> chart<00:01:06.969> which

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
is not listed in this chart which

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
is not listed in this chart which
presented<00:01:08.200> me<00:01:08.469> with<00:01:08.499> a<00:01:08.709> little<00:01:08.950> mathematical

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
presented me with a little mathematical

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.139 
presented me with a little mathematical
problem<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.389> had<00:01:10.569> to<00:01:10.689> figure<00:01:10.929> out<00:01:11.289> so<00:01:12.149> basically

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
problem I had to figure out so basically

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.789 
problem I had to figure out so basically
what<00:01:13.329> I<00:01:13.359> did<00:01:13.479> was<00:01:13.899> just<00:01:14.079> take<00:01:14.170> one<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.709> the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
what I did was just take one of the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.560 
what I did was just take one of the
figures<00:01:15.039> on<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.789> same<00:01:16.030> style<00:01:16.389> of<00:01:16.600> pool

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
figures on the same style of pool

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.270 
figures on the same style of pool
pool<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.890> tells<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.370> how<00:01:19.820> much<00:01:21.220> how<00:01:22.220> many

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
pool and it tells you how much how many

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.520 
pool and it tells you how much how many
pounds<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.940> salt<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.420> add<00:01:23.600> for<00:01:23.990> this<00:01:24.110> example

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
pounds of salt to add for this example

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.500 
pounds of salt to add for this example
they're<00:01:24.800> saying<00:01:25.100> put<00:01:25.370> in<00:01:25.490> 80<00:01:25.700> pounds<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.240> salt

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
they're saying put in 80 pounds of salt

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.080 
they're saying put in 80 pounds of salt
for<00:01:26.810> thirty<00:01:27.560> two<00:01:27.800> hundred<00:01:27.830> gallons<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.790> water

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
for thirty two hundred gallons of water

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.420 
for thirty two hundred gallons of water
well<00:01:29.630> like<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.990> said<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.260> only<00:01:30.530> have<00:01:30.710> about<00:01:30.830> 17

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
well like I said I only have about 17

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.880 
well like I said I only have about 17
hundred<00:01:31.760> gallons<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.479> I<00:01:32.720> figured<00:01:33.500> out<00:01:33.650> the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
hundred gallons so I figured out the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.340 
hundred gallons so I figured out the
quantity<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.460> pounds<00:01:35.030> per<00:01:35.240> gallons<00:01:35.750> by<00:01:36.020> doing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
quantity of pounds per gallons by doing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.680 
quantity of pounds per gallons by doing
some<00:01:36.530> simple<00:01:36.740> division<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.640> then<00:01:38.180> multiply

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
some simple division and then multiply

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.800 
some simple division and then multiply
that<00:01:38.720> number<00:01:38.960> by<00:01:39.440> my<00:01:40.310> gallons<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.479> told

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
that number by my gallons and that told

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.080 
that number by my gallons and that told
me<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.410> needed<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.250> was<00:01:43.490> somewhere<00:01:44.030> in

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
me what I needed and I was somewhere in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.030 
me what I needed and I was somewhere in
the<00:01:44.330> 40<00:01:44.660> pound<00:01:44.869> range<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:45.440> just<00:01:45.740> dumped<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
the 40 pound range so I just dumped the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.400 
the 40 pound range so I just dumped the
whole<00:01:46.070> bag<00:01:46.400> let<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.509> dissolve<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.259> then<00:01:48.380> I

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
whole bag let it dissolve and then I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.650 
whole bag let it dissolve and then I
took<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.580> pool<00:01:49.850> store<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.330> next<00:01:50.479> day

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
took it to the pool store the next day

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.779 
took it to the pool store the next day
and<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.560> turns<00:01:51.740> out<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:51.979> got<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> parts<00:01:52.640> per

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
and it turns out I got the parts per

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.270 
and it turns out I got the parts per
million<00:01:53.020> right<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.229> middle<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
million right in the middle that the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.550 
million right in the middle that the
recommended<00:01:55.910> charts<00:01:56.330> oh<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> got<00:01:56.990> lucky<00:01:57.320> there

enough salt in the pool to generate
chlorine<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> season<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:05.899> pretty<00:02:06.200> good

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
chlorine for a season that's pretty good

your copper concentration and you want

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.340 
your copper concentration and you want
it<00:02:27.110> between<00:02:27.440> 0<00:02:27.680> point<00:02:27.980> 1<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.730> point<00:02:28.820> 2<00:02:29.360> parts

boost cycle and the boost cycle creates

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
boost cycle and the boost cycle creates
copper<00:02:40.670> ions<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.239> puts<00:02:41.450> them<00:02:41.540> into<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.900> water

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
copper ions and puts them into the water

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.220 
copper ions and puts them into the water
and<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.239> copper<00:02:44.239> electrode<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.019> there

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
and there's a copper electrode in there

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.569 
and there's a copper electrode in there
to<00:02:45.890> do<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:47.600> runs<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.350> four<00:02:48.920> times<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
to do that and it runs at four times the

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.690 
to do that and it runs at four times the
amount<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:50.180> hours<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:51.829> have<00:02:52.040> programmed

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
amount of hours that you have programmed

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.990 
amount of hours that you have programmed
in<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> unit<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.200> by<00:02:54.620> their<00:02:54.860> example<00:02:55.250> if

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
in the unit so by their example if

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.110 
in the unit so by their example if
have<00:02:56.180> your<00:02:57.280> generator<00:02:58.280> set<00:02:58.580> two<00:02:58.610> run<00:02:58.880> two

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
have your generator set two run two

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.260 
have your generator set two run two
hours<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> day<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.800> boost<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:01.970> going

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
hours a day and you boost it it's going

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.530 
hours a day and you boost it it's going
to<00:03:02.360> run<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.540> eight<00:03:02.930> hours<00:03:02.960> total<00:03:04.210> so<00:03:05.210> since

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
to run for eight hours total so since

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.370 
to run for eight hours total so since
this<00:03:05.720> requires<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.240> pump<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.360> be<00:03:08.570> running<00:03:09.020> you

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
this requires the pump to be running you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.050 
this requires the pump to be running you
need<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.620> make<00:03:09.800> sure<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.520> your<00:03:10.640> pump<00:03:10.850> is

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
need to make sure that your pump is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.660 
need to make sure that your pump is
running<00:03:11.330> in<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.780> time<00:03:12.080> frame<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:13.520> you're

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
running in that time frame so if you're

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.210 
running in that time frame so if you're
typically<00:03:14.270> running<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.230> for<00:03:15.410> one<00:03:15.680> hour<00:03:15.920> and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
typically running it for one hour and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.370 
typically running it for one hour and
you<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.790> your<00:03:16.970> pump<00:03:17.209> set<00:03:17.510> at<00:03:17.630> two<00:03:17.900> hours

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
you have your pump set at two hours

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.800 
you have your pump set at two hours
because<00:03:18.950> they<00:03:19.190> say<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.820> run<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.360> pump<00:03:20.570> one

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
because they say to run the pump one

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.870 
because they say to run the pump one
hour<00:03:20.959> after<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.800> generator<00:03:22.250> shuts<00:03:22.610> off

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
hour after the generator shuts off

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.870 
hour after the generator shuts off
you're<00:03:23.780> going<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.080> want<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.380> up<00:03:25.190> those<00:03:25.610> hours

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
you're going to want to up those hours

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.510 
you're going to want to up those hours
or<00:03:26.360> manually<00:03:26.870> turn<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.290> pump<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:28.340> it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
or manually turn the pump on so it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.479 
or manually turn the pump on so it
encompasses<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:30.770> your<00:03:31.010> pump<00:03:31.280> shuts

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
encompasses that and if your pump shuts

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.030 
encompasses that and if your pump shuts
off<00:03:31.760> for<00:03:32.000> any<00:03:32.120> reason<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.900> will<00:03:33.110> throw<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.739> water

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
off for any reason it will throw a water

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.040 
off for any reason it will throw a water
flow<00:03:34.459> alarm<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.180> you'll<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.690> start<00:03:35.900> all

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
flow alarm and you'll have to start all

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.280 
flow alarm and you'll have to start all
over<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.850> another<00:03:38.060> issue<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.750> have

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
over and that is another issue I do have

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.430 
over and that is another issue I do have
is<00:03:39.940> trying<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.180> get<00:03:41.330> everything<00:03:41.630> synced<00:03:42.320> up

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
is trying to get everything synced up

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.580 
is trying to get everything synced up
correctly<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:44.270> just<00:03:44.900> don't<00:03:45.050> quite<00:03:45.350> have<00:03:45.530> it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
correctly I just don't quite have it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.300 
correctly I just don't quite have it
right<00:03:45.920> yet<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:47.239> example<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.080> want<00:03:48.770> to<00:03:48.950> do<00:03:49.070> one

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
right yet for example I want to do one

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.310 
right yet for example I want to do one
hour<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.730> saltwater<00:03:50.090> generation<00:03:51.080> and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
hour of saltwater generation and

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.490 
hour of saltwater generation and
chlorine<00:03:52.070> generation<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.660> need<00:03:53.900> my<00:03:54.050> pump<00:03:54.320> to

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
chlorine generation so I need my pump to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.640 
chlorine generation so I need my pump to
run<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.800> too<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.580> what<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.790> do<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.540> start<00:03:57.140> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
run it too so what I do is I start the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.250 
run it too so what I do is I start the
pump<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.220> pump<00:03:59.000> has<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.450> timer<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.019> it's

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
pump and the pump has a timer and it's

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.650 
pump and the pump has a timer and it's
set<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.470> room<00:04:00.769> two<00:04:00.980> hours<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:02.239> wait<00:04:02.450> about

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
set to room two hours and I wait about

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.270 
set to room two hours and I wait about
10<00:04:02.959> minutes<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.530> then<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.799> go<00:04:03.950> ahead<00:04:04.160> and

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
10 minutes and then I go ahead and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.890 
10 minutes and then I go ahead and
program<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.420> starts<00:04:05.780> the

that's<00:04:11.120> what<00:04:11.330> they're<00:04:11.480> recommending<00:04:12.340> well<00:04:13.340> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
that's what they're recommending well I

as i can tell you about getting in it
you<00:05:59.620> know<00:05:59.740> i<00:05:59.770> had<00:06:00.130> been<00:06:00.340> chlorinating<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.240> for

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
you know i had been chlorinating it for

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.870 
you know i had been chlorinating it for
a<00:06:01.570> couple<00:06:01.960> of<00:06:02.229> weeks<00:06:02.370> because<00:06:03.370> i<00:06:03.430> didn't<00:06:03.729> have

a couple of weeks because i didn't have

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.740 
a couple of weeks because i didn't have
this<00:06:04.090> system<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:06.370> course<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.419> know<00:06:07.570> it's

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
this system and of course you know it's

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.379 
this system and of course you know it's
a<00:06:07.840> chlorinated<00:06:08.169> pool<00:06:08.590> well<00:06:09.490> i<00:06:09.520> got<00:06:09.639> this<00:06:10.060> thing

a chlorinated pool well i got this thing
set<00:06:10.720> up<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.260> finally<00:06:11.800> got<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.190> chlorine

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
set up and finally got the chlorine

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.900 
set up and finally got the chlorine
adjusted<00:06:13.060> properly<00:06:13.300> in<00:06:13.870> it<00:06:14.020> and<00:06:14.610> got<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:15.880> the

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
adjusted properly in it and got in the

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.670 
adjusted properly in it and got in the
pool<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:16.720> I'm<00:06:17.080> absolutely<00:06:17.770> amazed<00:06:18.760> on<00:06:19.389> how

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
pool and I'm absolutely amazed on how

pool and I'm absolutely amazed on how
nice<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:21.099> water<00:06:21.340> feels<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:23.530> just<00:06:23.860> softens

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250

faint<00:06:28.650> taste<00:06:29.650> of<00:06:30.039> salt<00:06:30.550> because<00:06:30.940> I<00:06:31.270> have<00:06:31.389> the

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
faint taste of salt because I have the

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.620 
faint taste of salt because I have the
salt<00:06:31.720> content<00:06:31.930> correct<00:06:32.710> and<00:06:33.450> it's<00:06:34.450> not
