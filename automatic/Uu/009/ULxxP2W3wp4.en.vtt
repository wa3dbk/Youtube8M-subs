00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.650
 Kazakhstan is waiting for serious 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.680
 the consequences of sending soldiers to 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.480
 afghanistan in support of the continent 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.540
 nato on the eve with such a message to the people 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.040
 republics were made by the Taliban movement and 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.050
 Today in mid did clarify that our 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.840
 soldiers are going not to fight about 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 rulings of peaceful life in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.260
 Afghanistan, there are pros and cons 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.689
 studied Vladislav Tsoi 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.679
 with Kazakhstan is the first time to 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.720
 detailed Islamic Taliban movement 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.390
 addressed his appeal to the people 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750
 Republic and not just she turned 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.240
 the whole world voiced a direct threat 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.910
 Kazakhstan aims to protect the interests of the United States 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.989
 instead of considering the desire 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.590
 country population and regional 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 interests 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770
 Muslims of Kazakhstan should 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.110
 rebel against wrong policy 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 his leadership of this step by 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.750
 Kazakhstan is still long-term and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.050
 negative impact on relationships 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.610
 Afghanistan with Kazakhstan and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.680
 countries of the region 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.720
 domestic parliamentarians such 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 could not miss past the ears 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.970
 defense minister sat tokpakbayev his 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.550
 the response message to the tariff the whole world knows 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670
 what help is better 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.370
 in the humanities material plan 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.530
 render but afghanistan 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.380
 and this is politics 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.280
 continued 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.730
 I think the Taliban got mixed up 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.170
 it may be in a pharmacy such 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 percentage of th statement from 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.380
 not easy to confuse Kazakhstan 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 really agreed to participate 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.420
 coalition of international forces 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.060
 the crux of the question are four military men 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.369
 all future kazakhstan 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.240
 contingent in afghanistan its place 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.490
 not a military unit at all but a technical one 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.000
 analytical and medical 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.030
 support of the operation of peacekeepers 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 from four percent two military 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.950
 one child analysts 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.870
 I am one logistics support specialist 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.350
 thus, it is not a matter of direction 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.420
 this contingent country 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.970
 Armed Forces of Kazakhstan 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.000
 rather, it’s about citizen participation 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.050
 advice and acknowledged he 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.300
 the chosen people of afghanistan 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.470
 government and parliament 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.430
 but in providing security and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.130
 restoring a peaceful life in this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.840
 country 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.980
 reacted and those who intend to help 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.770
 Kazakhstan Chargé d'affaires ai 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 Kazakhstani people 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.700

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.440

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.879
 all countries which participates 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.999

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.229
 they are at risk 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.379
 Political analyst dosy Satpayev sure 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.840
 ignore taliban appeals 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.029
 it is impossible they sometimes embodies their threats 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.629
 life so was money and britain attacks in 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.689

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.010
 just in p then 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.430
 it is about what the legs considered as 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460
 demonstratively symbolic act 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.639
