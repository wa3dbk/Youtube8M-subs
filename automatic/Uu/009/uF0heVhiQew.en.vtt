00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
so you can always trim those up later

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.310 
so you can always trim those up later
then<00:00:39.950> about<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.280> half<00:00:41.820> inch<00:00:42.300> down<00:00:42.780> from<00:00:42.840> your

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
then about a half inch down from your

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
then about a half inch down from your
main<00:00:43.469> hole<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.219> want<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.700> X<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
main hole you want to make an X with a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
main hole you want to make an X with a
knife<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.410> directly<00:00:46.770> across<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.340> not

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
knife and then directly across or not

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
knife and then directly across or not
make<00:00:47.640> another<00:00:47.879> X<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.420> that'll<00:00:49.050> make<00:00:49.170> your

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
make another X and that'll make your

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
make another X and that'll make your
stick<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:50.129> through<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.059> something<00:00:51.539> for

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
stick go through and for something for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.910 
stick go through and for something for
the<00:00:51.780> birds<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.199> stand<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> land<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:54.920> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the birds to stand on and land on so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
the birds to stand on and land on so
we'll<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.190> ahead<00:00:56.219> and<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> exact

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we'll go ahead and then on the exact

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
we'll go ahead and then on the exact
same<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:08.010> will<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.880> another<00:01:09.090> X<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
same side will do another X just for the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
same side will do another X just for the
knife<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.549> easier<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:20.689> okay<00:01:21.720> now

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
knife the easier it will be okay now

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
knife the easier it will be okay now
