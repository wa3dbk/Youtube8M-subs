here<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.050> channel<00:02:24.290> there's<00:02:25.099> real<00:02:25.459> value

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
here on this channel there's real value

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.790 
here on this channel there's real value
to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.599> fact<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.959> people<00:02:27.380> who<00:02:27.500> train

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
to the fact that people who train

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040 
to the fact that people who train
following<00:02:28.190> programs<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.760> don't<00:02:29.000> vary<00:02:29.840> your

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
volumes in a systematic way will

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.699 
volumes in a systematic way will
eventually<00:02:32.720> lead<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:32.989> overtraining

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
eventually lead to overtraining

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.020 
eventually lead to overtraining
especially<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.430> you're<00:02:34.760> not<00:02:34.880> sleeping

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030

properly you're eating right but blaming
everything<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.970> CNS<00:02:38.480> burnout<00:02:38.930> as<00:02:39.110> a

everything on CNS burnout as a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.100 
everything on CNS burnout as a
convenient<00:02:40.940> excuse<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.300> not<00:02:41.510> work<00:02:41.690> out<00:02:41.870> hard

convenient excuse to not work out hard

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.540 
convenient excuse to not work out hard
is<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.010> right<00:02:43.160> answer

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
is not the right answer

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.970 
is not the right answer
so<00:02:44.000> ease<00:02:44.360> up<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.720> little<00:02:44.750> bit<00:02:45.050> on<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.680> push

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
so ease up a little bit on this and push

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.410 
so ease up a little bit on this and push
a<00:02:46.010> little<00:02:46.340> bit<00:02:46.430> more<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.819> gym<00:02:46.850> you're

workouts with a plan that systematically

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800 
workouts with a plan that systematically

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
you're going to do tomorrow then that's

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.630 
you're going to do tomorrow then that's
training<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:24.470> think<00:05:24.980> it's<00:05:25.100> time<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.280> we<00:05:25.400> start

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
training I think it's time that we start

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.400 
training I think it's time that we start
doing<00:05:25.910> more<00:05:26.060> training<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:26.990> little<00:05:27.260> bit

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
doing more training and a little bit

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.530 
doing more training and a little bit
less<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:28.010> these<00:05:28.190> wads<00:05:28.460> you'll<00:05:29.240> be<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.390> lot

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
less of these wads you'll be a lot

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.210 
less of these wads you'll be a lot
further<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:29.960> down<00:05:30.170> that<00:05:30.380> path<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.890> what<00:05:31.070> you

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
further on down that path of what you

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.920 
further on down that path of what you
want<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.580> be<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:31.940> look<00:05:32.090> like<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.570> function

through our spine we realize that the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.190 
through our spine we realize that the
core<00:06:07.010> is<00:06:07.040> about<00:06:07.310> much<00:06:07.550> more<00:06:07.580> than<00:06:08.120> just<00:06:08.420> your

peripheral joints like our arms and our

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.220 
peripheral joints like our arms and our

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
legs can influence our core if you're

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.690 
legs can influence our core if you're
going<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.470> start<00:06:15.650> pointing<00:06:16.070> to<00:06:16.220> your<00:06:16.310> core<00:06:16.580> you

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
going to start pointing to your core you

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.430 
going to start pointing to your core you
better<00:06:16.940> start<00:06:17.120> learning<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:17.570> point<00:06:17.840> all<00:06:18.050> over

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
better start learning the point all over

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.970 
better start learning the point all over
your<00:06:18.560> body

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
your body

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.650 
your body
because<00:06:19.460> your<00:06:19.640> core<00:06:19.850> can<00:06:20.000> be<00:06:20.030> influenced<00:06:20.570> by

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
because your core can be influenced by

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.810 
because your core can be influenced by
every<00:06:21.020> single<00:06:21.380> move<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:21.770> do<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.280> here<00:06:22.730> at

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
every single move you do and here at
