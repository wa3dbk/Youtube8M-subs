00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
this middle block here one node on the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.149 
this middle block here one node on the
left<00:02:00.970> eye<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:02.229> want<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.470> do<00:02:02.619> two<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:02.920> top

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
left eye on you want to do two on top

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.630 
left eye on you want to do two on top
then<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.150> want<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> do<00:02:04.570> an<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.810> left<00:02:04.960> eye<00:02:05.200> not

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
then you want to do an up left eye not

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.110 
then you want to do an up left eye not
like<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:10.170> nice<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.380> easy<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.770> what<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:12.790> want

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like that nice and easy and what we want

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.000 
like that nice and easy and what we want
to<00:02:13.270> do<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:13.900> make<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.290> metrically

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
to do that will make is metrically

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.100 
to do that will make is metrically
because<00:02:15.370> why<00:02:15.790> not<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.660> want<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.900> repeat

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
because why not we just want to repeat

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.780 
because why not we just want to repeat
the<00:02:17.260> same<00:02:17.440> process<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> other<00:02:18.190> side<00:02:18.519> I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the same process on the other side I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
the same process on the other side I
want<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.900> from<00:02:20.050> here<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.310> know

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
want to do so from here just you know

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.430 
want to do so from here just you know
mirroring<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.570> want<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> do<00:02:23.019> an<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.260> left

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
left out not one on top one to the right

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.740 
left out not one on top one to the right
and<00:04:04.520> then<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:04.880> just<00:04:05.090> keep<00:04:05.240> going<00:04:05.390> bottom

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
and then you just keep going bottom

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.870 
and then you just keep going bottom
right<00:04:05.900> diagonals<00:04:06.470> until<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.280> all<00:04:07.400> joins<00:04:07.670> up

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
right diagonals until it all joins up

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.280 
right diagonals until it all joins up
nicely<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.800> so<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:09.860> can<00:04:09.950> see<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.260> just

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
nicely like that so you can see so just

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.820 
nicely like that so you can see so just
to<00:04:12.590> get<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.770> close-up<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.850> ant<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.830> also

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
to get a close-up of the ant and I also

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.210 
to get a close-up of the ant and I also
if<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.130> have<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.810> body<00:04:17.989> pause<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.130> if

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
it is for the color I'm not even going

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.040 
it is for the color I'm not even going
to<00:04:27.800> skip<00:04:28.040> forward<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:29.030> all<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.600> dark<00:04:29.810> green

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
pixel art is really easy so this left

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.820 
pixel art is really easy so this left
front<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.700> then<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.990> start<00:04:36.290> from<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.560> bottom
