00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 walking all this band youtube 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 your supporter there is in this video les 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 we can bring a tweet believes that I think that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.440
 Most of you will like it 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 this personal good tweet has been 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 become one of my favorites and this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 is the name of the tweet is called bus and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 I think it means music in another language 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.380
 and what allows us to do this tweet is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.830
 have videos put videos as ringtones 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 now they can replace their ringtones 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.349
 sounds for a video a video that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.530
 you can download directly from 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.809
 tweet the application or you can 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.149
 also this one put your own video of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.920
 you and I will also show you how 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.050
 do that first thing they have to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 to do is go to Syria this tweet is 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.840
 totally free do not have to add 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 no any repository and just 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 they are going to be and they look for by the word 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.840
 music is written as they press e 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 install and confirm after doing 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.280
 that or the prim for three the first time 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.089
 that are going to open the tweet will ask 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 your name 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.560
 age mail the email your 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.619
 favorite band do not have to write 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.350
 correctly all that afterwards is going to 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.640
 bring to this one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 to this interface here in settings too 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.850
 According to you can receive video calls 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.009
 facetime with video but I have pierced and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.470
 it does not work 100% 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 or whether video calls perhaps 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.789
 a new update fix it in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 that and here in full screen is simply 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.830
 so that the video looks completely 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.920
 on the whole screen from your device 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.020
 and this as I say maybe this one 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.050
 works on the ipad touch since according to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.240
 also this one supports facetime but not 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.810
 works 100% facetime there in 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.670
 contacts that is a x3 can choose 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.550
 this any contact that you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 can add to that specific video 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.280
 who want to have the ringtone video 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 here in down down can look for the band 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.679
 you like the press in the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.110
 in the video that you like and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.450
 they press on to give this it takes 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.760
 depending on the speed of your 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.890
 Internet after they finish 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.069
 download the video 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.350
 they go here in video colts and here is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.050
 where you can choose the video 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 that you like if you want this in the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.209
 that you like to press in the good 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.280
 this let's choose press on it and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.760
 here you can edit it can cut it 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.800
 let's say 30 seconds the video and here 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.080
 down can not hear what parts what 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.530
 that they chose if they like that part 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720
 they simply press save 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 the only disadvantage I looked at that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.490
 when you are this someone is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.650
 calling 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.180
 to answer is going to take about 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.280
 how many seconds for the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.670
 call and that I think it's for the video 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.980
 and another disadvantage is that it brings us 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.700
 promotion a small promotion here a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.210
 propaganda when someone is calling 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.670
 there those the only disadvantages had a 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.310
 click above that blocked us the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.230
 this propagandas I forgot the name 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.660
 but I do remember putting it in the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.660
 description of the video and that would be all 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.120
 for example this I want a few 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.120
 seconds 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.260
 pressure to save us and there it is and it is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.120
 call now do not have to be in 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.650
 locked the device so that 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.760
 someone call me may be this 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.100
 way in any application and someone 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.710
 Well, you can call them and they will serve there 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.820
 is 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.820
 can not block 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.939
 this is because you are 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.040
 proof that rights exist 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.600
 reserved author and there it is 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.510
 so you can this one put your 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.900
 own this own videos of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.000
 you as ringtone are going to have to 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.470
 use iphone bucks or any other 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 program that allows them to enter the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.980
 Root root of your device and the path 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.990
 It's bar 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.550
 mobile bar and this is the same as if 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.680
 I was in my phone bucks in music 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 and that's where they're going to put the one 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.300
 you like it is the same as I say it in 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.840
 life and books 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.460
 and music and there it puts in the video that 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.759
 you like they have to be in format 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.979
 mp4 for this to work well there 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.840
 is this was all about this video 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.759
