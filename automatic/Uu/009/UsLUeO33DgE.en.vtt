we're going to do a certified run for

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.190 
we're going to do a certified run for
the<00:02:39.980> front<00:02:40.980> channels<00:02:41.459> which<00:02:41.609> are<00:02:41.760> bridged

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the front channels which are bridged

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.119 
the front channels which are bridged
they're<00:02:43.200> rated<00:02:43.499> at<00:02:43.560> 75<00:02:44.129> watts<00:02:44.489> by<00:02:44.790> 2<00:02:45.859> so<00:02:46.859> we

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
they're rated at 75 watts by 2 so we

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:55.189 
they're rated at 75 watts by 2 so we
were<00:02:47.219> expecting<00:02:51.290> 150<00:02:52.290> watts<00:02:54.079> again<00:02:55.079> the

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
were expecting 150 watts again the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.720
