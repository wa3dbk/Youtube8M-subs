00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.199 
what you say okay so I took a picture
and<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:24.599> can<00:02:24.959> see<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:25.829> very<00:02:25.890> well<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and you can see it's not very well and

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
and you can see it's not very well and
so<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.959> flash<00:02:28.170> killed<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> open

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
so the flash killed it open

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.930 
so the flash killed it open
you<00:02:29.400> took<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.670> specially<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.120> that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.339 

you'd<00:02:33.940> expect<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.450> turn<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.050> way<00:02:35.170> up

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
you'd expect it to turn the right way up

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.170 
you'd expect it to turn the right way up
when<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> turn<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.010> but<00:02:36.459> now<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> stays<00:02:37.150> that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
when you turn it but now it stays that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.559 
when you turn it but now it stays that
way

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
way

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.900 
way
so<00:02:38.110> that's<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.160> most<00:02:39.310> annoying<00:02:39.610> thing

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
so that's just the most annoying thing

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.970 
so that's just the most annoying thing
for<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.209> because<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.020> want<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> wire<00:02:41.470> fissure

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
for me because you want the wire fissure

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.979 
for me because you want the wire fissure
and<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:43.060> could<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.569> way<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:43.750> it

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
and you could do it that way but it

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.510 
and you could do it that way but it
doesn't<00:02:44.140> work<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.440> way<00:02:44.680> it'll<00:02:45.069> just<00:02:45.310> see

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
doesn't work that way it'll just see

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.030 
doesn't work that way it'll just see
what<00:02:46.120> widescreen<00:02:48.390> pencil<00:02:49.390> anyways<00:02:50.040> it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
what widescreen pencil anyways it's

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.970 
what widescreen pencil anyways it's

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
doesn't really draw the internet very

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.729 
doesn't really draw the internet very
well<00:03:49.069> because<00:03:50.069> it's<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.489> slow<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:52.590> it's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
well because it's really slow so it's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.770
