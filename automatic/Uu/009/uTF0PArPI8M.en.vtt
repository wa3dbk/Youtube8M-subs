we<00:00:26.710> can<00:00:27.009> push<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.490> boundaries<00:00:27.820> but<00:00:28.630> what<00:00:28.869> if

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
we can push the boundaries but what if

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.380 
we can push the boundaries but what if
there<00:00:29.230> were<00:00:29.500> no<00:00:29.529> boundaries<00:00:30.070> what<00:00:30.970> if<00:00:31.089> we<00:00:31.210> got

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
there were no boundaries what if we got

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.200 
there were no boundaries what if we got
rid<00:00:31.599> of<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.810> obstacles<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:33.489> if<00:00:33.640> we<00:00:33.820> didn't

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
rid of the obstacles what if we didn't

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.540 
rid of the obstacles what if we didn't
limit<00:00:34.540> ourselves<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.770> was<00:00:35.950> that<00:00:36.160> kind<00:00:36.460> of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
limit ourselves it was that kind of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.100 
limit ourselves it was that kind of
thinking<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.090> allowed<00:00:37.390> us<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.600> reach<00:00:37.899> a

curiosity our engineers push the
boundaries<00:01:06.970> beyond<00:01:07.360> anything<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:08.140> we<00:01:08.320> had

boundaries beyond anything that we had

mind how much better could we make your
iPods<00:01:14.080> out<00:01:14.790> let's<00:01:15.790> hear<00:01:16.000> more<00:01:16.030> from<00:01:16.540> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
iPods out let's hear more from the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.560 
iPods out let's hear more from the
engineers<00:01:17.140> who<00:01:17.290> created<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.950> system<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
engineers who created the system so the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
engineers who created the system so the
initial<00:01:19.840> challenge<00:01:20.200> we<00:01:20.350> were<00:01:20.440> given<00:01:20.800> was<00:01:21.250> to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
initial challenge we were given was to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.310 
initial challenge we were given was to
build<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.820> best<00:01:22.030> sounding<00:01:22.540> iPod<00:01:22.870> speaker<00:01:23.230> we

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
build the best sounding iPod speaker we

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.680 
build the best sounding iPod speaker we
can<00:01:23.560> with<00:01:23.830> no<00:01:24.010> constraints<00:01:24.340> but<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.480> really

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
can with no constraints but that really

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.840 
can with no constraints but that really
brings<00:01:26.080> out<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.320> energy<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.730> excitement

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
brings out the energy and the excitement

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.150 
brings out the energy and the excitement
of<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> engineering<00:01:28.720> discipline<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.350> say<00:01:29.500> you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
of the engineering discipline to say you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.090 
of the engineering discipline to say you
know<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:31.110> many<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.290> bows<00:01:32.440> are<00:01:32.620> motivated<00:01:33.070> by

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
know as many and bows are motivated by

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.740 
know as many and bows are motivated by
if<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.430> not<00:01:33.580> impossible<00:01:34.150> why<00:01:34.300> bother<00:01:34.510> doing

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
if it's not impossible why bother doing

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.110 
if it's not impossible why bother doing
it<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.620> once<00:01:35.770> we<00:01:35.890> had<00:01:36.010> an<00:01:36.280> acoustic<00:01:36.730> prototype

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
it so once we had an acoustic prototype

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.460 
it so once we had an acoustic prototype
we<00:01:37.330> knew<00:01:37.540> how<00:01:37.750> great<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.170> could<00:01:38.320> make

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
we knew how great we could make

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.770 
we knew how great we could make
something<00:01:38.770> sound<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.460> next<00:01:39.670> step<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:40.090> okay

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
something sound the next step was okay

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.990 
something sound the next step was okay
let's<00:01:41.470> make<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.890> small<00:01:42.220> enough<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.670> fit<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:42.970> a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
let's make that small enough to fit in a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.300 
let's make that small enough to fit in a
customer's<00:01:43.420> home<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.410> went<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.890> some<00:01:45.190> of

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
customer's home and we went to some of

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.030 
customer's home and we went to some of
the<00:01:45.370> more<00:01:45.520> creative<00:01:46.110> engineering<00:01:47.110> resources

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
the more creative engineering resources

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.680 
the more creative engineering resources
we<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.730> research<00:01:49.000> domain<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.540> said

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
we have in the research domain and said

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.600 
we have in the research domain and said
you<00:01:50.530> know<00:01:50.620> here's<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.010> size<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.430> box

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
you know here's the size of the box

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.040 
you know here's the size of the box
what's<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.120> best<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.510> can<00:01:52.660> do

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
what's the best you can do

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.410 
what's the best you can do
Wow<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:54.250> actually<00:01:54.670> got<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.000> into<00:01:55.210> something

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
Wow we actually got it into something

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.510 
Wow we actually got it into something
that<00:01:55.570> size<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:56.620> sounds<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.130> great<00:01:57.310> has

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
that size and it sounds that great has

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.540 
that size and it sounds that great has
that<00:01:57.730> power<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.960> has<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.740> sound<00:02:00.010> quality

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
that power it has that sound quality

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.820 
that power it has that sound quality
getting<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.450> performance<00:02:02.020> like<00:02:02.230> that<00:02:02.260> from<00:02:02.740> a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
getting a performance like that from a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.260 
getting a performance like that from a
