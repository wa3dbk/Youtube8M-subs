00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 two home games play young 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.470
 psv this season on May 14 will be the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 Competition concluded at ajax but 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.550
 first the team of marco roelofsen 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.809
 on the contrary young heerenveen 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.089
 and of course it is also possible tonight 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 count on the unconditional support 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.590
 from title jan 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.359
 you the banner your word the horn john 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 has a lot as always 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 fancy 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 this is valpoort name is heerenveen 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 pythons is right in between and the pie 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 picked on strong action from memphis depay 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.059
 everyone passes by like if there isn't 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 if the shot of the pie is something 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.360
 powerless 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 and therefore no problem because kenny 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.700
 steppe van sc heerenveen then freeze 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 on half of psv valpoort with the ball 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 until times that shoot and then through the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 bar and the back of his leather benjamin 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.219
 there the players from heerenveen who were lying 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.430
 and rightly so because this ball agrees 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.149
 line and therefore after 9 minutes 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.969
 footballs the lead for men fine 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.189
 is the ball on the crossbar unfortunate via 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.240
 the face of van leather the ball over the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.680
 line 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 and so a good decision of it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.930
 arbitral trio 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 locadia name is psv earlier this season 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.390
 won psv in heerenveen with two one 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.350
 do dongles from john books maria and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 jÃ¼rgen locadia 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 your stefano marzo with already on this one 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.210
 loadouts that gets some space 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 there but this is going really bad 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.050
 far about the goal of kenny steppe 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.690
 and so the 0 thus remains 0 and remains young 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.520
 psv looking for the equalizer but is 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.530
 it Heerenveen that brutally attack 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 searches through this quintus martinus martinus 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.250
 enters the duel with stefano marzo die 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.420
 keeps a good eye on the ball and catches 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.890
 the fronts out 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 at the expense of a corner kick 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.370
 heerenveen 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.320
 usual pictures in the Air Force 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.930
 forward of more organizes and stood 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.280
 here the ball away martinus 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.140
 food ooyyo and again hold the ball 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.330
 from the freezer 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.770
 This is bolted find the cross 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.060
 or alcohol that is used properly 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.640
 body keeps the overview 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.560
 La Parra is completely free there 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.320
 Pierre then jumps from Paris and beyond 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.300
 and 2 0 for heerenveen 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.760
 moderately defended by psv and from la parra 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.450
 know what to do with this opportunity 2 0 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.950
 so for the friezes and the rat this man 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.150
 benjamin of leather not taken into account 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.250
 taken into account 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.739
 ritzmaier played the ball and can again 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.470
 heerenveen you counter two fast ones 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.220
 winger martinus and here from la 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.690
 parra 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 enters the duel again with claire 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.700
 plays on actiris and that's how it is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.700
 before half time 3 0 for heerenveen 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 good action from van la parra and martinus 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.790
 failed in the 16-meter area of 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.720
 PSV and leather pads and all only 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.910
 agree on the outside 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.160
 19 already made this on Jurgen Locadia 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.360
 season this should be number 20 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 good rescue from kenny steppe 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.730
 here ali b comes to look at his brother-in-law 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.260
 abel tamata starting as a left back 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.270
 but he too could not prevent the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.040
 rest position 3 wheel was in favor of 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.440
 heerenveen here the few nice action 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.350
 but just like in the first half too 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.250
 little power in that shot and therefore can 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.980
 steppes 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.570
 easy parry safe where i 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 lost ball to jason mott shower that 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.500
 goes looking for space again because that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.810
 Worked to the ground by Thomas 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.340
 baker supplying heerenveen and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.350
 referee max 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.380
 psv gives a free kick on a nice 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.790
 position the pie tries the low rescue 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.500
 of steppes 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.510
 and that's how it looks like that ball 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.380
 doesn't want to get in at all tonight 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380
 previous young psv 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.870
 the drink well 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.000
 this also gives away space in the back 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.580
 martinus here with the cross the bet 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.080
 portcullis of an excellent rescue 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.090
 benjamin of leather 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.110
 design team saved here from one 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.090
 greater backlog outside army 20 one 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.310
 violation indicates referee box 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.900
 then go grab tinus and work again 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.010
 there he scores his second of the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.640
 contest 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.669
 0 for young heerenveen such a light young 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.950
 psv so a hopeless defeat in this 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.500
 competition in two weeks goes young PSV 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.300
 visiting Sparta Rotterdam and the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.680
 close the competition as mentioned 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.090
 against ajax 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.640
 here the other results by name but 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.669
 evening az wins with three rather sparta and 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.860
 Twente beats FC Groningen and Cambuur 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.260
 thus secures the championship 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.840
 what is also striking is that feyenoord at home 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.760
 loses from ajax and that nec fc oss with 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.190
 4 2 wins from ado the hague 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.979
 file fc twente so champion with 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.370
 52 points from 24 matches 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.220
 ajax follows 7 points az star third 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.380
 and psv we now find in place 4 with 41 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.510
 points here especially the lack of jurgen 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.530
 locadia still on score with 19 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.990
 goals 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.190
 with is the pike made 9 bluetooth 8 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.190
 and ritzmaier 7
