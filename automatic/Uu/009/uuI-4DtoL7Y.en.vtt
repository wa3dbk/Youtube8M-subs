build heavy supply pads right away and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
build heavy supply pads right away and
they<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.639> have<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.999> pay<00:01:48.270> extra<00:01:48.840> supplies<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829

they don't have to pay extra supplies to
make<00:01:50.100> those<00:01:50.310> heavy<00:01:50.609> supply<00:01:50.969> pets<00:01:51.289> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
make those heavy supply pets and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.609 
make those heavy supply pets and
basically<00:01:54.450> their<00:01:54.749> whole<00:01:54.990> base<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
basically their whole base is going to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.300 
basically their whole base is going to
be<00:01:55.709> filled<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:55.950> supply<00:01:56.340> pads<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:59.130> i'm<00:01:59.189> going

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
be filled with supply pads now i'm going

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.559 
be filled with supply pads now i'm going
to<00:01:59.369> say<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> most<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.179> game<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.539> are

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
to say for the most of the game they are

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.959

going<00:02:00.779> to<00:02:01.189> supply<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.279> so<00:02:02.429> you<00:02:02.639> can<00:02:02.880> build

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
going to supply you so you can build

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.029 
going to supply you so you can build
your<00:02:03.090> scarab<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.779> that's<00:02:04.529> pretty<00:02:04.799> much<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
your scarab and that's pretty much the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.809 
your scarab and that's pretty much the
main<00:02:05.340> focus<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.060> how<00:02:06.359> it's<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.659> work

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.780 

now<00:02:12.629> another<00:02:12.959> important<00:02:13.650> thing<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.040> take

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
now another important thing is to take

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.920 
now another important thing is to take
any<00:02:15.120> reactors<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.739> map<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.659> save

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
any reactors on the map on this can save

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
any reactors on the map on this can save
you<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.700> lot<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.760> resources<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:23.150> actually<00:02:24.150> a

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
you a lot of resources and actually a

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.979 
you a lot of resources and actually a
lot<00:02:24.389> of<00:02:24.569> time<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.489> there<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.879> reactors<00:02:27.780> on

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
lot of time so if there are reactors on

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.319 
lot of time so if there are reactors on
the<00:02:28.079> map<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.319> are<00:02:28.590> playing<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.370> would

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
the map you are playing on I would

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.470 
the map you are playing on I would
suggest<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:32.250> Covenant<00:02:32.700> player<00:02:32.939> take<00:02:33.269> those

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
suggest the Covenant player take those

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
suggest the Covenant player take those
reactors<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.540> best<00:02:37.019> Matt<00:02:37.500> obviously<00:02:38.060> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
reactors now the best Matt obviously is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.099 
reactors now the best Matt obviously is
on<00:02:39.530> Exile<00:02:40.939> because<00:02:41.939> in<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.419> back<00:02:42.659> there<00:02:42.959> are

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
on Exile because in the back there are

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.929 
on Exile because in the back there are

two reactors that you can claim and
that's<00:02:45.689> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.989> save<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.439> around<00:02:47.219> 3,000

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
that's going to save you around 3,000

that's going to save you around 3,000
supplies<00:02:49.699> it<00:02:50.699> will<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> huge<00:02:51.329> benefit<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
supplies it will be a huge benefit to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:06.589 
supplies it will be a huge benefit to
you<00:03:03.079> now<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.139> next<00:03:04.500> thing<00:03:05.120> claim<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> second

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
you now the next thing claim a second

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.259 
you now the next thing claim a second
base<00:03:07.099> um<00:03:08.269> i<00:03:09.889> would<00:03:10.889> suggest<00:03:11.209> claiming<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
base um i would suggest claiming a

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.569 
base um i would suggest claiming a
second<00:03:12.629> base<00:03:12.810> after<00:03:13.109> you<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.310> first

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
second base after you have your first

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.509 
second base after you have your first
scarab<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:19.500> your<00:03:19.709> second<00:03:20.099> base<00:03:20.280> you

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
scarab that way in your second base you

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.360 
scarab that way in your second base you
can<00:03:20.699> pretty<00:03:20.939> much<00:03:21.650> start<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.769> get<00:03:22.949> an<00:03:23.099> even

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
can pretty much start to get an even

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.999 
can pretty much start to get an even
better<00:03:23.609> economy<00:03:24.329> build<00:03:25.049> better<00:03:25.259> supply<00:03:25.709> pads

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
better economy build better supply pads

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.759 
better economy build better supply pads
um<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:27.659> you<00:03:27.900> also<00:03:28.109> need<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> use<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.979> for<00:03:29.189> a

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
um and you also need to use it for a

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.420 
um and you also need to use it for a
summit<00:03:31.769> which<00:03:32.159> will<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.479> be<00:03:33.900> making

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
summit which will you will be making

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.960 
summit which will you will be making
engineers<00:03:35.430> those<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.299> be<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.449> huge<00:03:36.750> help

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
engineers those can be a huge help

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.939 
engineers those can be a huge help
depending<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:38.970> what<00:03:39.299> kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.500> spot<00:03:40.799> you're

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
depending on what kind of a spot you're

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:53.059 
depending on what kind of a spot you're
in<00:03:40.979> during<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.370> game<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.780> pretty<00:03:52.019> much<00:03:52.109> it

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
in during the game so pretty much it

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.959 
in during the game so pretty much it
costs<00:03:54.060> 20<00:03:54.479> population<00:03:55.079> for<00:03:55.259> each<00:03:55.409> scarab

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
costs 20 population for each scarab

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.920 
costs 20 population for each scarab
meaning<00:03:56.969> you'll<00:03:57.269> have<00:03:57.329> about<00:03:58.549> around<00:03:59.549> 10<00:03:59.930> yeah

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
meaning you'll have about around 10 yeah

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.890 
meaning you'll have about around 10 yeah
you'll<00:04:01.109> have<00:04:01.169> ten<00:04:02.209> population<00:04:03.209> units<00:04:03.599> open

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
you'll have ten population units open

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.020 
you'll have ten population units open
and<00:04:06.229> the<00:04:07.229> best<00:04:07.560> i've<00:04:07.889> found<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.459> just<00:04:08.729> to<00:04:08.849> make

and the best i've found is just to make

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.399 
and the best i've found is just to make
10<00:04:09.509> engineers<00:04:11.090> also<00:04:12.090> make<00:04:12.509> sure<00:04:12.539> you<00:04:12.810> upgrade

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.909 
10 engineers also make sure you upgrade
those<00:04:13.650> engineers<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.870> state<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.289> grace<00:04:16.590> which

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
those engineers to state of grace which

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.430 
those engineers to state of grace which
actually<00:04:17.190> makes<00:04:17.789> them<00:04:18.139> whatever<00:04:19.139> they're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
actually makes them whatever they're

actually makes them whatever they're
healing<00:04:19.709> they<00:04:20.430> can<00:04:20.609> heal<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.909> faster

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
healing they can heal it faster

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.530 
healing they can heal it faster
and<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.120> be<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.510> huge<00:04:23.780> help<00:04:25.180> I'm<00:04:26.180> also
