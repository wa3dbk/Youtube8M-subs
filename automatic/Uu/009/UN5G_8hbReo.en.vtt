00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
the failure in this but the point is

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.170 
the failure in this but the point is
guys<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.680> athlean-x<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.860> about<00:03:37.160> not<00:03:38.150> just

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
being unique but keeping things simple

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.020 
being unique but keeping things simple
that<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.540> can<00:03:41.690> do<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.320> get<00:03:42.920> results<00:03:43.130> anywhere
