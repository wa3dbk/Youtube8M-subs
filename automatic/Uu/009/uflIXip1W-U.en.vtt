00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 mobile phone users every time 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.269
 They have new needs and I think 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.099
 in that he has taken a step forward in these 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.259
 times when security and 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.389
 protection of your info with some of the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.800
 most important factors for 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.289
 consumers 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.869
 this Korean firm has given right in the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 nail with the creation of the no code 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.640
 the latest in easy access I have always 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 been forcing the absence of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.180
 users notice that there are three very terms 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.420
 important accessibility security and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.590
 ease of use then the first one what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 what he did is put the buttons back 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 second implemented the knock out function 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.500
 which is to add a security term 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 not with then not with what we 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.070
 allows is to access our team more 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.199
 sure faster more comfortable but also 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 of the security issue this option 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 It also facilitates the immediacy of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 unlock our cell phone there 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 discovered by a recent study 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.290
 made to his clients that on average 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 the common smartphone user usually 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 Unlock your phone up to 60 times 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.900
 day on the other hand its functioning is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.869
 almost intuitive you should only set 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 previously a pattern of up to 8 touches 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
 that should be given in any of the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 four invisible quadrants in which 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.590
 the screen is divided giving thus the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.990
 possibility of 80,000 combinations 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 different many of the others 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 smartphones you need to unlock the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 computer number then access the code 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.079
 of the unlock pattern you just sign in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 in case of knockouts what in the novelty 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.460
 of knockout is that you do not need 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.189
 unlock it with the screen off 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
 we enter the touch our pattern of 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.420
 touches and automatically unlocks 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.990
