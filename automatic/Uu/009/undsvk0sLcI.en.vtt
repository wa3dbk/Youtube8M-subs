this<00:02:47.650> happen<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.549> it's<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.910> kind<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.299> stuff

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
this happen like it's that kind of stuff

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.960 
this happen like it's that kind of stuff
that<00:02:49.720> actually<00:02:49.840> goes<00:02:50.170> forward<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.760> make

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
that actually goes forward and can make

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:03.589 
that actually goes forward and can make
you<00:02:52.329> know<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> difference<00:02:52.959> on<00:02:53.109> terms<00:02:53.350> of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
so our faculty objective was was

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.619 
so our faculty objective was was
educational<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.349> fact<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:09.159> it<00:03:10.120> also<00:03:10.330> has<00:03:10.599> a

project managers people that also can
sit<00:05:04.060> back<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.690> kind<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.140> see<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.920> bigger

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
sit back and kind of see the bigger

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.150 
sit back and kind of see the bigger
picture<00:05:06.690> as<00:05:07.690> well<00:05:08.080> on<00:05:08.470> kind<00:05:08.830> of<00:05:08.860> what<00:05:09.010> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
picture as well on kind of what the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.120 
picture as well on kind of what the
issues<00:05:09.550> are<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.230> kind<00:05:11.230> of<00:05:11.290> coalescing<00:05:11.740> with

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
issues are and kind of coalescing with

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.610 
issues are and kind of coalescing with
the<00:05:12.190> project<00:05:12.610> managers<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.560> think

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the project managers have have I think

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.850 
the project managers have have I think
given<00:05:15.310> us<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.760> really<00:05:16.480> really<00:05:16.780> great<00:05:16.960> kind<00:05:17.770> of

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
given us a really really great kind of

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.360 
given us a really really great kind of
group<00:05:18.190> dynamic<00:05:19.710> we've<00:05:20.710> all<00:05:20.860> become<00:05:21.070> very

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
group dynamic we've all become very

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.060 
group dynamic we've all become very
flexible<00:05:21.910> as<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.990> design<00:05:23.650> changes<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:26.070> we

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
flexible as the design changes and we

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.640 
flexible as the design changes and we
work<00:05:27.250> together<00:05:27.430> on<00:05:27.960> defining<00:05:28.960> exactly<00:05:29.530> what

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
work together on defining exactly what

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.220 
work together on defining exactly what
it<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.860> what<00:05:30.100> we<00:05:30.190> want<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.900> just<00:05:32.050> have<00:05:32.140> to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
it is what we want and you just have to

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.250 
it is what we want and you just have to
jump<00:05:32.440> in<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.980> figure<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.880> out<00:05:34.060> together

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
jump in and figure it out together

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.360 
jump in and figure it out together
that's<00:05:35.260> like<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.680> main<00:05:35.830> thing<00:05:35.860> I've<00:05:36.130> learned

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
that's like the main thing I've learned

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.220 
that's like the main thing I've learned
is<00:05:36.610> we're<00:05:36.940> all<00:05:37.030> troubleshooting<00:05:37.930> together

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
is we're all troubleshooting together

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.880 
is we're all troubleshooting together
and<00:05:38.470> trying<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.710> figure<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.040> out<00:05:40.740> sure<00:05:41.740> it's

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
and trying to figure this out sure it's

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.530 
and trying to figure this out sure it's
are<00:05:43.290> very<00:05:44.290> much<00:05:44.560> like<00:05:45.040> some<00:05:45.700> situations<00:05:46.360> in

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
are very much like some situations in

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.060 
are very much like some situations in
real<00:05:46.570> life<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.200> focused<00:05:48.660> effort<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:50.770> come<00:05:50.950> up

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
real life a focused effort to come up

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.740 
real life a focused effort to come up
with<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.250> design<00:05:51.669> based<00:05:51.940> on<00:05:52.210> realistic

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
with a design based on realistic

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.970 
with a design based on realistic
criteria<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:55.290> that's<00:05:56.290> something<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:56.860> you

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
criteria and that's something that you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.550 
criteria and that's something that you
don't<00:05:57.100> get<00:05:57.460> every<00:05:57.669> day<00:05:57.790> in<00:05:57.910> class<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.900> the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
don't get every day in class the the

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.440 
don't get every day in class the the
capability<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.520> actually<00:06:00.669> have<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.180> goal<00:06:01.480> that

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
capability to actually have a goal that

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.200 
capability to actually have a goal that
is<00:06:04.450> realistic<00:06:05.230> and<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:06.070> expectations<00:06:06.880> are

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
is realistic and the expectations are

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.610 
is realistic and the expectations are
coming<00:06:07.630> from<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.870> people<00:06:07.990> in<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.320> cities

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
coming from the people in the cities

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.710 
coming from the people in the cities
themselves<00:06:08.910> it's<00:06:09.910> not<00:06:10.150> an<00:06:10.270> idealized

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
themselves it's not an idealized

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.240 
themselves it's not an idealized
solution<00:06:11.350> which<00:06:11.500> makes<00:06:11.740> it<00:06:11.860> perfect<00:06:12.220> for

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
solution which makes it perfect for

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.610 
solution which makes it perfect for
education<00:06:13.030> that's<00:06:13.840> where<00:06:14.080> you<00:06:14.200> learn<00:06:14.380> how<00:06:14.590> to

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
education that's where you learn how to

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.530 
education that's where you learn how to
work<00:06:14.800> together<00:06:14.950> as<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> team<00:06:15.610> especially<00:06:16.390> here

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
work together as a team especially here

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.930 
work together as a team especially here
in<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.660> interdisciplinary<00:06:17.820> vertical<00:06:18.820> nature

in the interdisciplinary vertical nature

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.010 
in the interdisciplinary vertical nature
of<00:06:19.150> this<00:06:19.360> year

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
of this year

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.589 
of this year
itself<00:06:20.379> very<00:06:20.710> well<00:06:20.770> to<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.250> idea<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.729> finding

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
itself very well to the idea of finding

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.050 
itself very well to the idea of finding
out<00:06:22.720> how<00:06:23.229> all<00:06:23.500> these<00:06:23.650> talents<00:06:24.129> in<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.340> CD<00:06:24.819> come

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
out how all these talents in the CD come

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.050 
out how all these talents in the CD come
together<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.539> produce<00:06:25.750> something<00:06:26.379> coherent

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
together to produce something coherent

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.879 
together to produce something coherent
beautiful<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.180> useful<00:06:28.379> so<00:06:29.379> these<00:06:29.500> different

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
beautiful and useful so these different
