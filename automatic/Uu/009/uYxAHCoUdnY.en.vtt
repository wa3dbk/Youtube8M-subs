those<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.290> two<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.560> staple<00:02:04.860> bikes<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
those are two of the staple bikes that

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.030 
those are two of the staple bikes that
we<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:06.110> you'll<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.440> lot<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.620> the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
we use you'll see that a lot of the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.859 
we use you'll see that a lot of the
street<00:02:08.220> freestyle<00:02:08.640> riders<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.119> use<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> 600

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

cc<00:02:10.170> class<00:02:10.290> motorcycles<00:02:11.070> simply<00:02:11.820> because

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
cc class motorcycles simply because

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.210 
cc class motorcycles simply because
they're<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.210> forgiving<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
they're more forgiving it's not that it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.620 
they're more forgiving it's not that it
necessarily<00:02:14.340> makes<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.090> tricks<00:02:15.300> easier

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
necessarily makes this the tricks easier

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.300 
necessarily makes this the tricks easier
because<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> power<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> thousand<00:02:16.920> does

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
because the power of a thousand does

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.180 
because the power of a thousand does
actually<00:02:17.550> make<00:02:17.930> doing<00:02:18.930> wheelies<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.470> of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
actually make doing wheelies or of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.060 
actually make doing wheelies or of
course<00:02:20.400> being<00:02:20.790> able<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.240> wheelies<00:02:22.070> much

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
course being able to do wheelies much

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
course being able to do wheelies much
easier<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.060> powers<00:02:24.360> there

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
easier because the the powers there

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600 
easier because the the powers there
although<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.350> 600<00:02:25.800> class<00:02:25.950> motorcycle

what I consider a dream job I literally

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.830 
what I consider a dream job I literally
ride<00:07:11.680> a<00:07:11.710> bike<00:07:11.919> for<00:07:12.130> a<00:07:12.160> living<00:07:12.430> and<00:07:13.030> I<00:07:13.419> wouldn't

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
ride a bike for a living and I wouldn't

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.950 
ride a bike for a living and I wouldn't
have<00:07:13.960> it<00:07:14.020> any<00:07:14.140> other<00:07:14.260> way<00:07:14.490> it'd<00:07:15.490> be<00:07:15.610> nice<00:07:15.790> if

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
have it any other way it'd be nice if

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.980 
have it any other way it'd be nice if
sure<00:07:16.960> if<00:07:17.200> we<00:07:17.320> didn't<00:07:17.560> have<00:07:17.620> to<00:07:17.710> have<00:07:18.210> all<00:07:19.210> the<00:07:19.510> I

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
sure if we didn't have to have all the I

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.510 
sure if we didn't have to have all the I
I<00:07:20.229> guess<00:07:20.800> if<00:07:20.919> we<00:07:20.950> didn't<00:07:21.190> have<00:07:21.280> to<00:07:21.400> do

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
I guess if we didn't have to do

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.950 
I guess if we didn't have to do
everything<00:07:21.820> and<00:07:22.180> we<00:07:22.360> could<00:07:22.479> sit<00:07:22.660> back<00:07:22.780> and

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
everything and we could sit back and

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.990 
everything and we could sit back and
relax<00:07:23.140> and<00:07:23.500> enjoy<00:07:23.560> a<00:07:23.770> little<00:07:24.100> bit<00:07:24.190> more<00:07:24.370> that

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
relax and enjoy a little bit more that

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.060 
relax and enjoy a little bit more that
would<00:07:25.120> be<00:07:25.240> nice<00:07:25.419> but<00:07:25.930> at<00:07:26.050> the<00:07:26.140> same<00:07:26.290> time<00:07:26.530> I

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
would be nice but at the same time I

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.260 
would be nice but at the same time I
literally<00:07:27.580> don't<00:07:27.729> think<00:07:27.940> I<00:07:27.970> would<00:07:28.090> want

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
literally don't think I would want

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.610 
literally don't think I would want
