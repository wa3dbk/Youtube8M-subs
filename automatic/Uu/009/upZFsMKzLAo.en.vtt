probably some love tokens to open it up
take<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.550> look<00:00:46.670> at<00:00:47.059> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570 

four<00:01:12.990> characters<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:16.410> cards<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> play

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
four characters the cards that you play

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.450 
four characters the cards that you play
those<00:01:17.790> characters<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.510> game<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:26.310> get

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
believe only the base game and three

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090

expansion packs are out now this is a
kind<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:44.970> an<00:01:45.090> import<00:01:45.510> game<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.780> believe<00:01:46.140> it's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
kind of an import game I believe it's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
kind of an import game I believe it's
fully<00:01:46.500> released<00:01:46.890> another<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:48.090> least<00:01:48.150> one<00:01:48.510> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
fully released another at least one of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.390 
fully released another at least one of
the<00:01:48.720> country<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.830> if<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.040> Japan

the country I don't know if it's Japan

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.180 
the country I don't know if it's Japan
or<00:01:50.670> France<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.770> where<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.860> originally

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
get a little like a timeline for the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.710 
get a little like a timeline for the
figures<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.310> relate<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.450> story

I<00:02:03.899> don't<00:02:04.080> owning<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.440> story<00:02:04.759> get<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.789> code<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I don't owning the story get a code to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.310 
I don't owning the story get a code to
do<00:02:07.140> something<00:02:07.530> online<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:09.050> then<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> get

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
do something online and then you get

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.300 
do something online and then you get
kind<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.700> instruction<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:13.070> on<00:02:14.070> how<00:02:14.280> to

kind of a so instruction there on how to

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.990 
kind of a so instruction there on how to
use<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> cause

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.520 

I'm<00:02:21.000> gonna<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.390> two<00:02:22.050> lamps<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:27.360> two<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'm gonna get two lamps or two to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.200 
I'm gonna get two lamps or two to
foldouts<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.790> they're<00:02:29.940> gonna<00:02:30.030> be

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
foldouts here and they're gonna be

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.570 
foldouts here and they're gonna be
double-sided<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.290> frozen<00:02:32.160> dual

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
double-sided so this is frozen dual

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.290 
double-sided so this is frozen dual
mount<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:36.360> there<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:38.220> then<00:02:38.850> he<00:02:38.940> had<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
mount see there and then he had the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.610 
mount see there and then he had the
bunch<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.900> golden<00:02:40.440> crocodiles<00:02:41.070> map<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
other stuff that's two of the maps you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.940 
other stuff that's two of the maps you
get<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.030> don't<00:02:54.930> know<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.110> these<00:02:55.320> are<00:02:55.380> random

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
get it I don't know if these are random

every time you get them have even to the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.060 
every time you get them have even to the
crueler<00:03:03.660> math<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:06.360> one<00:03:06.720> side<00:03:09.530> they<00:03:10.530> got

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
crueler math here on one side they got

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.450 
crueler math here on one side they got
this<00:03:11.280> map<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:11.730> another<00:03:11.970> Pat<00:03:13.160> about<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> other

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
this map and another Pat about the other

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.050 
this map and another Pat about the other
side<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.210> don't<00:03:15.450> believe<00:03:15.540> this

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
side of it I don't believe this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.310 
side of it I don't believe this
this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.480> Peter<00:03:18.870> smize<00:03:19.260> challenge<00:03:24.320> some

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
this is the Peter smize challenge some

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.930 
this is the Peter smize challenge some
little<00:03:25.560> match<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.100> play<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.760> guess

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
little match you can play on it I guess

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.240 
little match you can play on it I guess
you<00:03:26.970> could<00:03:27.300> actually<00:03:28.260> maybe<00:03:28.590> play<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.950> game

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you could actually maybe play the game

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.300 
you could actually maybe play the game
with<00:03:30.240> these<00:03:30.480> without<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:34.200> board<00:03:34.440> game<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
with these without the board game and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.090 
with these without the board game and
you<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.550> some<00:03:35.700> tokens<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:36.360> it

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100
