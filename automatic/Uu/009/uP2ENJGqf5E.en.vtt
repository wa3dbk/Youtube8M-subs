00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
16550 I almost said 500 but then it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.720 
16550 I almost said 500 but then it
changed<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.810> 550<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.530> yeah<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.130> here's<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
changed to 550 so yeah so here's at the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.170 
changed to 550 so yeah so here's at the
second<00:02:24.060> level<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.069> sewer<00:02:26.340> level<00:02:26.670> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
second level that the sewer level this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
second level that the sewer level this
is<00:02:27.360> where<00:02:27.510> things<00:02:27.780> start<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.440> real

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
is where things start to get real

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.890 
is where things start to get real
because<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.340> sewer<00:02:29.550> level<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.150> hard<00:02:30.569> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
because the sewer level is really hard I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.590 
because the sewer level is really hard I
lost<00:02:31.410> all<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.890> lives<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:33.030> look<00:02:33.510> how

lost all of my lives on it like look how
dark<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.130> cool<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.489> mean<00:02:35.670> look

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
dark it is but it's so cool I mean look

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.940 
dark it is but it's so cool I mean look
at<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> awesome<00:02:36.300> goombahs<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.470> textures

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
at the awesome goombahs on the textures

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
at the awesome goombahs on the textures
of<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> game<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:39.330> talking<00:02:39.720> about<00:02:39.810> at<00:02:40.019> this

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of the game I was talking about at this

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.850 
of the game I was talking about at this
point<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> graphics<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.959> it's<00:02:43.620> kind<00:02:43.830> of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
point how the graphics it's it's kind of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.170 
point how the graphics it's it's kind of
hard<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.160> say<00:02:44.310> like<00:02:44.459> they're<00:02:44.640> not<00:02:44.760> realistic

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
hard to say like they're not realistic

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.600 
hard to say like they're not realistic
because<00:02:45.569> obviously<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:46.080> Mario<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:47.220> so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
because obviously it's Mario but it's so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460 
because obviously it's Mario but it's so
like<00:02:47.940> accurate<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> normal<00:02:49.170> Mario

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like accurate to the normal Mario

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
like accurate to the normal Mario
graphics<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.850> this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
graphics I really like that about this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.420 
graphics I really like that about this
game<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.660> um<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> difficult

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
game and um but it's kind of difficult

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.090 
game and um but it's kind of difficult
when<00:02:53.910> you're<00:02:54.030> playing<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.840> UM<00:02:55.170> kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.860> uh

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
when you're playing it to UM kind of uh

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.309 
when you're playing it to UM kind of uh
you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.180> recognize<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.959> depth<00:02:58.200> perception

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you know recognize your depth perception

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.650 
you know recognize your depth perception
because<00:02:59.100> sometimes<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.850> looks<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> coupe

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
because sometimes it looks like a coupe

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.360 
because sometimes it looks like a coupe
is<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.930> front<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.860> jump<00:03:02.130> really

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
is in front of you and you jump really

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.550 
is in front of you and you jump really
far<00:03:02.519> forward<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.299> jump<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.930> him<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.410> end

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
far forward to jump on him but you end

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.440 
far forward to jump on him but you end
up<00:03:04.590> jumping<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.069> front<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> him<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.239> have

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
up jumping in front of him so you have

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
up jumping in front of him so you have
to<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.690> keep<00:03:06.840> an<00:03:06.959> eye<00:03:07.049> on<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.290> mini-map<00:03:07.410> on

actually<00:03:20.250> found<00:03:20.730> myself<00:03:20.910> looking<00:03:21.420> at<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
actually found myself looking at the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.960 
actually found myself looking at the
mini-map<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.799> lot<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.220> time<00:03:23.430> because<00:03:23.820> it's

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
mini-map a lot of the time because it's

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.970 
mini-map a lot of the time because it's
kind<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.359> easier<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.930> control<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
kind of just easier to control with a

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.530 
kind of just easier to control with a
mini-map<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.329> you're<00:03:27.420> gonna

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
mini-map but you know if you're gonna

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.849 
mini-map but you know if you're gonna
just<00:03:27.780> play<00:03:27.989> like<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.500> might<00:03:28.680> as<00:03:28.769> well

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
just play like that you might as well

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.530 
just play like that you might as well
just<00:03:29.010> play<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.850> original<00:03:30.269> Super<00:03:30.510> Mario

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540

really fun experience

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.450 
really fun experience
um<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.640> mean<00:05:06.480> look<00:05:06.570> at<00:05:06.660> my<00:05:06.750> score<00:05:07.080> now<00:05:07.460> 22,000

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
um I mean look at my score now 22,000

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.630 
um I mean look at my score now 22,000
that's<00:05:08.580> pretty<00:05:08.760> cool<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:09.600> that<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.640> don't

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
that's pretty cool I like that I don't

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.100 
that's pretty cool I like that I don't
know<00:05:11.760> how<00:05:11.940> Mario<00:05:12.210> would<00:05:12.480> be<00:05:12.570> able<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.750> do<00:05:12.930> this

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
know how Mario would be able to do this

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.960 
know how Mario would be able to do this
because<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.680> can't<00:05:13.890> see<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> Piranha<00:05:14.520> Plants

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
because you can't see the Piranha Plants

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.820 
because you can't see the Piranha Plants
like<00:05:15.570> in<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> pipes<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.350> only<00:05:16.500> way<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.650> can

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
like in the pipes the only way you can

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.140 
like in the pipes the only way you can
really<00:05:16.950> tell<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:17.400> by<00:05:17.520> looking<00:05:17.670> at<00:05:18.000> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
really tell is by looking at the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.820 
really tell is by looking at the
mini-map<00:05:18.720> there<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.110> how<00:05:19.200> does<00:05:19.380> he<00:05:19.500> know<00:05:19.650> when

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
mini-map there so how does he know when

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.540 
mini-map there so how does he know when
they<00:05:19.920> come<00:05:20.100> out<00:05:20.130> it's<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.240> interesting

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
they come out it's kind of interesting

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.680 
they come out it's kind of interesting
okay<00:05:23.550> so<00:05:23.610> this<00:05:23.820> is<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.060> point<00:05:24.270> where<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.420> failed

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
okay so this is the point where I failed

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.030 
okay so this is the point where I failed
so<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:24.990> better<00:05:25.230> wrap<00:05:25.380> up<00:05:25.560> this<00:05:25.650> video<00:05:25.860> I

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
so I better wrap up this video I

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.150 
so I better wrap up this video I
basically<00:05:27.050> my<00:05:28.050> goal<00:05:28.080> was<00:05:28.500> just<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.920> keep<00:05:29.100> going

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
basically my goal was just to keep going

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.950 
basically my goal was just to keep going
until<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.730> ran<00:05:29.910> out<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.090> lives<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.690> actually

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
until I ran out of lives and actually

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.840 
until I ran out of lives and actually
died<00:05:31.110> pretty<00:05:31.320> quickly<00:05:31.620> because<00:05:31.890> like<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.669> said

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
died pretty quickly because like I said

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.140 
died pretty quickly because like I said
it's<00:05:33.000> really<00:05:33.150> hard<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.810> UM<00:05:34.100> just<00:05:35.100> kind<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.370> see

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
it's really hard to UM just kind of see

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's really hard to UM just kind of see
where<00:05:36.330> you're<00:05:36.450> going<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:36.990> game<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.500> you

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000
