00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.169
 the magazine from Berlin 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.739
 Annabelle spectators welcome 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.429
 in the meantime, only every third train leaves the German train 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.660
 On some days punctual chaos have been on the snow for weeks and weeks 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.759
 Ice is at fault, the train says 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.859
 in fact, the permanent delays are often inadequate 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.189
 Due to maintenance 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.780
 Aben evidence that there are some ice trains and partly broken girls 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.809
 therefore switched brakes over the rail rollers 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.190
 Backgrounds of Rosen Sieber and Hubert Siegmund 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.980
 Wanka out in the winter 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.890
 mass train cancellations and delays 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.870
 but the weather is not always the fault 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 Example Berlin Hauptbahnhof the day before Christmas Eve 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 just in the main travel season and just one of the most important 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660
 German long-haul routes 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.410
 Between Berlin and Munich every second ICE Hogs falls 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.330
 Temperatures just below zero let the flagship product German 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.150
 Railways make high technology limp 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.180
 the remaining trains overcrowded 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 This is of course annoying that the web is not so optimal on his technique 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330
 has a grip 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.980
 All prices quoted in the middle of the Isle of Man 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 I do not know how the general trend 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.450
 Maren customers need play of lies 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.290
 Ivanschitz hopes the weather 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 and on the manufacturers of ICE t 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.500
 She blamed design defects on the trains 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.780
 and the supreme overseer of the railway the Federal Minister of Transport he lays down 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.320
 in 15 cases 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 on 05 for the manufacturers to know 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.189
 That's when these low temperatures should be the glitches 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.450
 What we do not hear from the minister 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.700
 after contrasts searches would have avoided the mass train cancellations 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.970
 can be if the train would have waited their ice trains from rich 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.270
 but may 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.009
 is increasingly rare the case confirm us several nationwide 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.599
 Workshop staff Punt train driver 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.769
 nobody has the courage to speak in front of the camera so that is not about his job 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.769
 Fear must alienate like the pictures 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.609
 It's special in the last few months 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.459
 and in which the situation becomes increasingly acute, the absolute exceptional case 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.539
 if I have a win over the really complete trouble-free that is 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.039
 Casting absolute exception 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.269
 but usually the reins amount 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.739
 Deficiencies were and the minister says that is not a reason for the masses 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.219
 Failure of ice-air conditioning pay attention 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.299
 Because contrasts research there were, among other short circuits in electrical 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.329
 small boxes at the bottom of the trains 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.040
 Air vents are actually supposed to be condensed and invading 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.869
 Dismantle moisture but where they have not been sufficiently clogged 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.269
 and they iced 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.589
 so moisture accumulated and it came to short circuits 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.800
 the electronics of many trains failed 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.149
 Maintenance defects with great effect 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:16.909
 Dropouts and delays that why only things are often the customers 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.009
 discreet 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.199
 by chance we witness such a process 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.619
 Berlin main station in December a CIA to Hamburg is coming 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.920
 because of damage to the railcar 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 which it is called via speakers 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.579
 7 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.169
 No 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.439
 the announcement gives the impression that it is just on the way to the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.419
 Damage came 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.419
 indeed 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.219
 so our research at the train in the morning in Hamburg with several 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.950
 safety-related damage started 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.489
 and that though there are two the CD maintenance plant there 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.279
 why will such trains 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.079
 not set in stand before the ride ask us clock guide 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.519
 they are not reserve trains 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.519
 we were absolutely at the limit for a long time 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.079
 Vehicles are sent back to service with the car still on 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.069
 same amount 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.519
 With just under an hour late, the ICE finally runs in Berlin 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.109
 Raich 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.389
 a programmed one 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 delay 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.590
 because the train did not have to be repaired because of the crowd 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.759
 Start a slow easy 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.150
 leaked us before entering the protocol of the delayed ICE 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.300
 it occupies 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.150
 on a balcony was a compressed air premise 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.219
 because of a brake and a rest is off 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.259
 one of several brakes of the train but with this strong field of the ICE at that time 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.819
 apparently already two weeks 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.730
 and now he keeps falling 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.120
 many hundreds of kilometers more and more late 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.130
 unthinkable because at high speed such a 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.360
 Brochure about which he physically designed and remains to strains 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.930
 perhaps 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.639
 completely traveling or breaking 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.800
 I do not want to lose this part 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.840
 In the worst case this can lead to the train being out of the lane 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.219
 Is "leveraged" 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.499
 and the Kleist 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.220
 one of several officers of the train damaged and therefore turned off 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.999
 no individual case we learn in the course of our research 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.270
 what does the EU say what Doc 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 the Federal Ministry of Transport 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.860
 Now say garage employees engine driver was almost the rule 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.180
 that trains with power units off and off 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.270
 Brakes drive through the area 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.009
 this is indicated by the direction that Danny finds is diminished so that 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.560
 safety again 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.770
 the safety can be said to have gone on but that conditionally 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.020
 of course a corresponding delay 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.880
 Percent of the turn instead of the then need to maintain is simply the pace 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.430
 something throttled 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.820
 Questionable security because what happens in an emergency, for example when suddenly 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.960
 Animals on the track are the two years ago in a tunnel near Fulda 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.180
 when a tree falls on the track 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.180
 the same year at Brühl 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.060
 "We do not have him in vain 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.580
 all vehicles brake these 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.460
 at an obstacle on the track, of course, no one expected cardboard rolls 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.839
 11 the overturning then it can be level in case of danger 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.839
 that this off then the brake is missing 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.589
 the railway company gives us diseases 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.469
 writing questions as detailed after each of the allegations 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.779
 denies it flat rate 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:41.009
 only safer Zivi leave the works is called 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.059
 at best, quote 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.870
 so-called comfort temperatures 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.610
 for example, the repair of defective coffee machines 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.129
 we had deferred in 13 cases in favor of vehicle availability 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.389
 only removed 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.440
 in a newsletter to employees 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.080
 and the responsible rail board fourth time had em-gold problems and 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.080
 although since 2007 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.300
 "In a time comparison we are observing a noticeably unstable operation today 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.039
 sometimes we lack the resources 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.599
 to bring the vehicles into the state 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.599
 which requires reliable and high-quality operation 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.720
 «I say it is a driver who sits in the front 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.129
 we should first come to the accident 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.889
 I have responsibility to hundreds of passengers and I want to 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.599
 Do not have to drive them to the limit every day for years 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.580
 the railway had announced its ice fleet in the next four weeks 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.090
 to rev up with such a different clock action action 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.710
 a mediocre maintenance would have spared that
