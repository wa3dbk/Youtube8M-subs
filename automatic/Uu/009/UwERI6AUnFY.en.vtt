00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 what makes a superhero of the world 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.200
 can not save because nothing is to be done 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.490
 he is virtually unemployed 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.509
 answered the video half life 3 1 da 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.920
 we see a fit pensioner resp 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 Gordon Freeman's easy on half-life 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.340
 3 is waiting where nothing has to do 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 boring him and he is content with 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210
 your gravity gun and a little alcohol 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.199
 besides, it's about to happen now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 turned 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.340
 because there is now the second 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.349
 chapter a trailer and also a trailer 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:43.829
 release-date all this now 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:46.379
 within the news after the intro was 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 Do you actually as a superhero than 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879
 world savior if just no zombie 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.250
 apocalypse as there are no aliens the earth 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.199
 try to conquer or otherwise 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 somehow the world threatens to go down 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 if you are virtually unemployed as 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.530
 superhero that's definitely one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.860
 very unfavorable situation 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.210
 and so it goes also currently god yes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.740
 freeman is probably the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.909
 one and the other or actually all 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
 episode 2 that's the last one, by the way 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 episode that has appeared or that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 last piece of meat that has appeared 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.330
 in 2007 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.869
 that's a bit longer now 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.710
 ago 2007 and we are currently waiting 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.409
 of course on half-life 3 or afx life 2 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 episode 3 whatever may come 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.320
 and now there is a very cool video 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.899
 that he probably already is her 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 In the background, see the studio fans 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.340
 post production is called half life 3 1 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.409
 So not announced and there you see 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 what the good gordon freeman 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.579
 right now, if he is on half-life 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.630
 3 or employment at work 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.219
 wait and yes i have to say that videos 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.140
 actually very sad has given me the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.420
 one or the other tear in any case 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 elicited and I just hope that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.440
 yourself yellow ual the wolf chef soften 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150
 lets and that is in the near future 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.579
 a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.239
 Announcement to a new half-life part 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.220
 will give 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.599
 i would definitely be gordon freeman 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 does treat the poor poor man gets 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.569
 four after you all totally 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.189
 sad are good at the good of the heavy 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.230
 destiny of gordon freeman 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.780
 it is now a little better 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.609
 message and indeed and saved the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.269
 horror shocker of the Indonesian 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.590
 indie developer digital happiness the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.439
 first part resp 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.359
 the episode of the first act the first 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.780
 chapter, whatever that call that 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.579
 may already be in may 2014 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.870
 appeared that is really already so again 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.909
 I thought so yesterday too 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.920
 boah as time goes by simply 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.780
 I also let's play and then became 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
 but said that it plays 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.519
 actually divided into two acts 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.500
 and everyone should cost $ 15 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.540
 called first so the fans said wow 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.980
 but that is relatively expensive because first 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.889
 was the title about the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.180
 financing platform indigo financed 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.840
 So that a platform like the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.760
 For example, kickstarter and then stop 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.650
 on the part of the fans said yes that is one 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
 a bit expensive because then both would 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.859
 parts together cost 30 dollars 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.810
 and 30 euros is the one 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.389
 second converted to the developers 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.949
 said yes ok and now it's just like that 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.109
 that the second part is the second 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.879
 chapter is then offered for free 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.799
 for the people that's just that 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.329
 So I'll buy then 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.859
 I do not have to pay anymore if I am 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 now the first part already bought 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.739
 that means I will definitely be one 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.269
 make match play and as I said now 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.879
 the trailer has been released 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.159
 together with a release date and the 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.680
 release date is the fourteenth second 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.659
 So the fourteenth february 2015 year 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.430
 Valentine's Day and nothing would be there 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.500
 can do better then the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.629
 just download the title or 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.989
 The tables bought then gets 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.769
 the second episode within one 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.419
 free updates or one 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.379
 automatic updates at steam then 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.139
 downloaded 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.280
 besides, it still will not know 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.319
 exactly when in the foreseeable future 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.780
 probably then a free roam 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.389
 give mode then you can then ghost 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.639
 years that are remembered within the 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.530
 story have not kept moving 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.500
 or simply not used 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.840
 So are gordon freeman ghosts 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.520
 So spirits who are unemployed 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.830
 from this mode then just again 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.360
 you're using it somehow yes 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.820
 have a meaning in their lives though 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.870
 they do not care that he has to 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.490
 I will definitely also a 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.630

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.699
