00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.180
 what saves the stock 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.630
 the first thing to do is to dry the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.900
 hair with a little volume at the top of the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.449
 Always use a small brush or 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.199
 average just to give a little of 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.199
 volume here 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.290
 the rest necessarily you can leave 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.960
 the laughter a little volume 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.330
 I know that the fringe to the side of the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 Volume 9 in the head and that unfortunately 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.520
 we became natural 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.790
 the first thing is to separate the fringe you 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:15.660
 will divide the lateral fringe asks 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:20.010
 thin and cable you hold that 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.250
 fringe so we can do the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.490
 hairstyle finishing 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:32.869
 here on top of my head I'm going to parade the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.869
 hair you slap a head high 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.150
 precisely to give volume and support 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.650
 if your hair is very beautiful you can 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.400
 use either spray or texturizer or 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.300
 even a song will help in the preparation 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.200
 You'll get this mixed fight in 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 medicine too 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.670
 And then with the help of a spray you 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.090
 This is what I hoped for. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.240
 that will help you mount the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.740
 hairstyle and you need not be afraid of 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.740
 undo what you did 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.110
 lightly love comes with the super light 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.750
 you go riding the hairstyle in 60 and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.270
 super lead by hand can not be heavy 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.960
 for you will be able to volumes and 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.750
 Feeling the idea is not to turn the volume down. 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:08.160
 are you just cleaning up with the help 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:13.740
 hand come here and so do you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:17.550
 will finalize and fix a little more 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:23.280
 distant and an average of 20 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.850
 centimeters away exactly you 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.140
 Can you give me your hair? 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:34.610
 and then after you've fixed it, it's going to drop 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.220
 that wick to get a clamp 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.130
 I always advise at that time a clamp 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.560
 as opposed to back to not score 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:49.500
 she can use a clip with rhinestones one 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.570
 album faith or even a tab 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.570
 with a flower a little detail 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.760
 at night but night exactly the spray 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.540
 to clean and secure better you see that the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.810
 clamp barely appears 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.480
 and this other side is also the advice 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.150
 let him go behind the ear 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.540
 she passes these three and tried to 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.239
 totally late in a hairstyle that 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.070
 ask for a little accessory an earring 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.070
 Makeup suddenly an eyeliner
