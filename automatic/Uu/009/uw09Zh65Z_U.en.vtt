segment we're gonna talk about the costs
of<00:00:04.770> installing<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.580> sprinkler<00:00:06.029> system<00:00:06.500> so<00:00:07.500> we

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
of installing a sprinkler system so we

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.009 
of installing a sprinkler system so we
have<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.130> beautiful<00:00:08.580> garden<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.570> spend<00:00:09.870> our

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
have a beautiful garden and we spend our

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.459 
have a beautiful garden and we spend our
evenings<00:00:10.219> watering<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.630> realize<00:00:13.049> over

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
evenings watering it and we realize over

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.079 
evenings watering it and we realize over
time<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.190> we're<00:00:14.340> spending<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.759> lot<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> time

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
time that we're spending a lot of time

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.180 
time that we're spending a lot of time
watering<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.379> want<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.770> install<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
watering so we want to install a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.550 
watering so we want to install a
sprinkler<00:00:17.520> system<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.690> there's<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.170> much

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
sprinkler system but there's so much

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.260 
sprinkler system but there's so much
information<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.910> how<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.119> I

information out there and how do I
figure<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.439> budget<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.460> need

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
figure out a budget and what do I need

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.509 
figure out a budget and what do I need
to<00:00:23.939> know<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> install<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> sprinkler<00:00:25.350> system

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
to know to install a sprinkler system

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
to know to install a sprinkler system
well<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.670> pretty<00:00:26.849> simple<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
well it's pretty simple you have to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
well it's pretty simple you have to
decide<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.070> spend<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
decide if you want to spend just a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.820 
decide if you want to spend just a
little<00:00:30.330> bit<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> money<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
little bit of money and if you want to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.770 
little bit of money and if you want to
do<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> lot<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> work<00:00:32.489> yourself<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
do a lot of the work yourself or if you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.080 
do a lot of the work yourself or if you
want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> hire<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.790> contractor<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
want to hire out a contractor or a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.530 
want to hire out a contractor or a
landscaper<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.500> install<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.360> lot

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
landscaper to install it and it's a lot

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
landscaper to install it and it's a lot
more<00:00:39.690> expensive<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.440> underground

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
more expensive to have underground

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.330 
more expensive to have underground
sprinkler<00:00:41.460> systems<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.270> opposed<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
sprinkler systems as opposed to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
sprinkler systems as opposed to
sprinkler<00:00:44.340> systems<00:00:44.730> above<00:00:45.090> ground<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.690> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
sprinkler systems above ground that are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.260 
sprinkler systems above ground that are
basically<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.140> hoses<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:46.980> rolling<00:00:47.550> systems

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
basically just hoses or rolling systems

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
basically just hoses or rolling systems
and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:49.230> you've<00:00:49.469> got<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> consider<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> most

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and then you've got to consider the most

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
and then you've got to consider the most
important<00:00:50.940> factor<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:52.050> water<00:00:52.289> pressure

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
important factor is your water pressure

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
important factor is your water pressure
if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.699> only<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.629> water

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
if you only have a little bit of water

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
if you only have a little bit of water
pressure<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.160> hard<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.879> support<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
pressure it's really hard to support a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
pressure it's really hard to support a
large<00:00:57.660> sprinkler<00:00:58.140> system<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:59.219> you're

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
large sprinkler system because you're

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
large sprinkler system because you're
gonna<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.030> enough<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:00.449> pressure

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
gonna have to have enough water pressure

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.979 
gonna have to have enough water pressure
to<00:01:01.469> supply<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> whole<00:01:02.550> system<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.750> water

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to supply the whole system with water

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
to supply the whole system with water
and<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> pressures<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.489> from<00:01:05.670> one

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and so the pressures got to go from one

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.460 
and so the pressures got to go from one
sprinkler<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> other<00:01:06.570> sprinkler<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sprinkler to the other sprinkler to the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
sprinkler to the other sprinkler to the
other<00:01:07.590> sprinkler<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.180> what

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
other sprinkler so you need to know what

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
other sprinkler so you need to know what
your<00:01:09.540> water<00:01:09.720> pressure<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.220> easy<00:01:11.430> way

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
your water pressure is and an easy way

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
your water pressure is and an easy way
to<00:01:11.729> figure<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.630> money<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to figure out how much money that you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.380 
to figure out how much money that you
can<00:01:13.500> spend<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> costs<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
can spend or how much it costs is to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
can spend or how much it costs is to
realize<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
realize that you can do a lot of it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
realize that you can do a lot of it
yourself<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.450> dig<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
yourself you can actually dig the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.590 
yourself you can actually dig the
trenches<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> pipes<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.000> try<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
trenches and get the pipes and try to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
trenches and get the pipes and try to
put<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> together<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.369> get

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
put it together and you can also get

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.450 
put it together and you can also get
bids<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> always<00:01:25.560> recommend<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.340> you
