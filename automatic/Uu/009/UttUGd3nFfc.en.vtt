00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.180
 after several wars confronting the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.820
 china and financial problems the states 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.090
 United States has passed is something of the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.300
 past 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.680
 in his place, he comes and he is a country 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.230
 divided into eight helmets 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.660
 You know that hunting, right? Well, I do not know. 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.210
 right let's not see caste is a way 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.040
 characterized by social stratification 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.390
 by inbreeding for transmitting 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.409
 hereditary lifestyle that 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.510
 often in tui a lost office 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.729
 everything up and stay I'm going to talk about 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.800
 house of a voracious game district 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.540
 only what kind in each breed do you have to 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.220
 do a specific job both in 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.860
 artist's house has caste 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.780
 writers at home teachers have cases 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.190
 everything about the profession that I have 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.360
 Let me also tell you that the houses 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.489
 13 seconds taken well tops and the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.140
 the rest of the poor and I think it's going to 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.540
 the eighth caste and the staff 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.360
 it was chaste they rob murder 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.219
 They do everything they do not like jesus understood 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.590
 these things like that and nobody likes them 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.610
 because they are far below the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.130
 social pyramid 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.170
 this whole country full of caste rule will 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.329
 be governed by a royal family and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.460
 this same royal family takes a course 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.880
 televised every time the prince 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.759
 reach a certain age he wishes to marry 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.320
 all girls between the ages of 16 and 21 think 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.420
 that the city are invited to 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 new princess the prince's new wife 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.399
 like that ball does not roll of eliana knows 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.899
 who goes there Pagnan dress in now 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.509
 that you already have in mind all these 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.439
 information to explain what will 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.630
 scroll on the selection of the one that names it 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.719
 the main character is america sir 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.850
 She's the redhead on the cover. 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.880
 caste 5 the house of the artists 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.259
 and she is very poor and America is already over 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.179
 accustomed to her life 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.220
 only one day the registration card for the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.910
 check arrives and her mom kind of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.569
 does not mean she obliges the daughter to 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.249
 enroll in selection 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.840
 only the American people she does not want 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.159
 say that none participate because she 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.930
 already have a boyfriend 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.280
 only that she dates hidden because the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.739
 The boy she is dating is from a caste. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.480
 she and her mother can not know 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.239
 Why does not her mother want her to be? 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.010
 Poor for all life, just take it from 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.530
 real people is that when a girl is 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 selected is chosen for the palace 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.310
 even if she does not win she will leave 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.920
 there is very famous and will participate in 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.090
 events will rise in caste will win 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.829
 a lot of money 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 money is something the family 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.419
 america needs a lot 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.609
 So she decides to save her boyfriend. 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:55.139
 to deal with the situation for money 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.000
 and america almost already has a 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.919
 thought decided she said no no 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.079
 I will fall in love with this principle is a 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.819
 asshole he agrees with this system of 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.439
 castes I do not agree is totally 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.139
 contrary to me was when it was drawn 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.719
 chosen for the palace knew the 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.989
 Prince and she will change her mind 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.389
 You can already see that 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.340
 here you still have to deal with life in the 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.949
 palace she has to deal with another 30 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.780
 and little girl is that they are disputing the 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.329
 I think you're going to have to give 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.370
 interviews for tv and has several tricks 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.680
 who are involved in this one of the blogs 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.659
 of conspiracy the noise of rebel of 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.359
 rebellion the people who do not agree with 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.620
 the caste system and etc. 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.379
 and it 's this story that's going to be 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.449
 presented to you in the selection I go 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.060
 having to talk when I saw the synopsis 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.769
 This book for the first time does not 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.729
 called so much attention I asked 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.889
 twitter people 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.479
 he just did not continue is going to be cool 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.040
 This was good because I ended up 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.949
 Surprising when I got the law 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.090
 because the reading is relaxed she was 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.709
 good and sertan 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.689
 at first I found it a little inevitable 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.269
 comparison of voracious games because it has 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.669
 quite something common thing this thing of fighters 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.819
 described above million with the government 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.900
 I found some greedy games but then I 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.939
 I got used to the universe of 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.349
 author, I think the author was also 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.319
 getting used to the universe she created 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.409
 and walked around and came out of a 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.130
 cool, but not forced way 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.259
 good 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.419
 about the characters I think the 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.310
 america is very normal it's like you 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.770
 because there are moments that you can not support 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 but it has moments that you find a 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.190
 coolest person I find interesting 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.110
 when the author can show this 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.419
 side of the character because I think super 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.250
 false character of a super wonderful character 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.680
 a super bad character because 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.270
 nobody is like that in real life and that's it 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.130
 that I also think that the ex-boyfriend of 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.229
 america or sp 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.479
 You can not know very well if it is 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.860
 speaking the truth he is lying if 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.389
 he is trying the americas 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.039
 even more because you see everything through 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.660
 point of view that it does not 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.380
 You know very well that's up to the head 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.539
 two faces 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.080
 this happens a lot with the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.569
 prince maxson and I do not trust iesp 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.310
 boy, mackson elias, for I chose with 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.020
 that America has a minority, I think 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.449
 I did not finish with either 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.360
 and with the money to save her son alone 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.280
 the cable had that the other 34 girls 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.099
 who are running the crown too 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.840
 should have been more exploited 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.520
 It's not good that the book is about 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.880
 america but people do not talk practically 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.569
 nothing all other type is 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.520
 god will give 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.590
 understood height could have taken advantage of the 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.720
 hooks and making a few less stories 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.490
 tense a fight story and 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.560
 to relate one to the other, I did not know 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.840
 have made thousands of stories very 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.259
 interesting but she ended up 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.330
 chose to delete all and do nothing 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.759
 the company of letters me one day I 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.199
 boy and ran to buy the 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.479
 elite way you lie she too 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.240
 practically the exact continuation of where 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.360
 for a selection then it gets kind of difficult 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.219
 not read one after another and will lose 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.030
 these first two I 'm waiting 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.259
 the one 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.620
 I think Brazil will call the 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.330
 choice is that it 's the last of the trilogy I 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.669
 I need this book that I'm curious about. 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.430
 God damn it, to know it's going to happen. 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.969
 with America or who will choose 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.860
 is 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.199
 Look what I'm talking about, so I want it. 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.819
 You're sending these faces to me. 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.560
 Now let's talk a little about the profile of 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.419
 voter this book because so I went 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.300
 pretty people enough video commenting 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.330
 to this book the girl and I think so 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.729
 totally relative because it's romance 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.180
 tm is from a girl's point of view 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.370
 More people have a girl than theirs. 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.440
 just as there is a boy who adores does not have 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.539
 how to say that only girls will like it and 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.850
 There is a boy who also likes to share 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.770
 this style but yes it is more likely 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.240
 that a girl will like this one more 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.490
 book because the boy 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.919
 finally sunny and open-minded on the day of 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.350
 Evening rain of boredom you will like 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.650
 You'll be curious to know what 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:53.520
 It's going to happen to this noisy girl. 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:56.699
 of the web is this I hope you have 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.440
 I like it if you like it, give it a jewel, comment it 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.900

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.099
 America stay with the prince or the 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.560
 ex-boyfriend with us 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:06.509
 story that if you did not read neither wind 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.610
 there says that you do not want it is 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.039
 very boring and invents that it will be 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.900
 Fun and with you and you talk to me too. 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.910
