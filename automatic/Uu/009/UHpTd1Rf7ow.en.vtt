00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.919
 a very interesting game as busy perhaps as was the game in the 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:04.660
 Olympic 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.500
 of the Copa do Brasil a beautiful match of all the great teams of the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.660
 brazilian football is clear exactly cipla dry we did not have here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.410
 no mine 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.320
 the same game we had there at the Olympic certainly from the point of view 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.759
 of application 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.039
 tactic 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.150
 It's a very disputed show. 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.999
 the part 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.799
 in a certain way rogerio marcelo foyer the victory of defense of the defensive system 

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:33.469
 of Sao Paulo organization that came here with a lot of fear of losing 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.010
 privileging this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.830
 to that more intense mark against the cruise that had a touch of ball 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.890
 speed as the main feature 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 what we saw was that the defensive system of São Paulo worked a lot 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.839
 well an incredible solidarity 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.160
 the attacking socks running 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.879
 the cruise in turn 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.870
 can not enjoy its main virtues exactly at the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.449
 the touch of the ball across the middle of the field 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.269
 I think the problem of the ones he concentrated on being half a field created a lot 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.839
 little noticed 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.729
 the half-apathetic field almost like the tone of adilson in the collective 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.310
 and the cruise that had won five rounds of departures from home liberators 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 né your first succulent game at home 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.840
 he won 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.899
 now lost pro sao paulo is open 2 to 0 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.870
 o são paulo managed with a two pass from fernandão 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.210
 the two goals of the gold medal won a beautiful victory he fernandão only without 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.810
 doubt was decisive beast in the first goal made the play of the second goal of 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.400
 hernanes 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 with a touch of heel and left therefore markers of the league 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.290
 strolling after him or even realizing where the ball is and there I still 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.770
 even from the front for goal and on the scoreboard the marcelo put very well the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.690
 project são paulo leaves here today with the scoreboard 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.540
 over and above 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.080
 and now of course you'll have to manage that in Morumbi and it's up to the cruise 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.540
 rescue 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.460
 the football that lost the game in the ninth gold mine we saw here was a 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.240
 cruise 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 very different from the one that makes us put saints cruise 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.410
 incredible as the top three 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.710
 is the country's works 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.819
 lucero struggled a lot to reduce this score, right? 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.900
 when he bumped into the rotunda ceni that spread on the beam and larissa 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.180
 especially at night and today was not good to protect that issue of reading 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.860
 grandson 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.349
 on the other hand, São Paulo is all right 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.569
 the cruise stumbled but mostly beyond the Germanic tradition 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.440
 participate or your 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.380
 own deficiency and creation the cruise today failed to flow as 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.829
 flowed in matches so far 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.589
 shevell so the fernandão was not stopped but was stopped when 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.870
 played his ball with 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.459
 the fable 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
 fernandão debuted premiered very well 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.250
 fernandão in two three plays were enough to leave 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.069
 field today as big highlight fernando streets said not scored goal 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.769
 but it made all the difference 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.830
 both in the first goal of the dagoberto 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.729
 as in the second of the second half for two years 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.369
 last year the cruise eliminated Sao Paulo in this same phase of 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:02.180
 competition 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.629
 the set and saw the goal overturned 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.029
 is not generating discussion be released prevented or not 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.380
 is my first impression was that I was there in the least 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.180
 on the same line so goal the goiás plays well has a rhythm performer 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.299
 are the cplp the ball we have to show after the sector today 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.999
 Do we really stay today? 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.010
 oo cruise really if in the field nou could not produce in the field and 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.039
 when did you need 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.619
 give any luck really did not count on her
