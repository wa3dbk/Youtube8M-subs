 cytoskeleton 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.229
 microtubules 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:10.780
 the cytoskeleton is 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.399
 a network of fibrous proteins 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.499
 which determines the shape of cells that do not have a cell wall 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.360
 supporting the movements of the cells come from support for the organ grinders 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.890
 cell phones and support for the division of chromosomes in the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 cell separation 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.879
 of fibrous proteins that make up the 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.780
 use microtubules thick microfilaments 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 2 and medium-sized filaments 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 microtubules are made of subunits formed by a protein 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 yamada tubulina 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.660
 when the particles are not forming microtubules are dissolved 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 in the cytoplasm these units are always ready and available 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.980
 the microtubules are assembled and disassembled when the cell 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.310
 require 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.940
 the subunits are reconstructed through centers that organize 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 microtubules located in various parts of the cell 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.470
 all eukaryotic cells have a microtubule organizing center 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 near the nucleus called centrosome 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.480
 during cell division the centrosome produces microtubules for the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.320
 ecuador cell that separate the highs or more and divide them into two daughter cells 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 in the animal cells the so-called centric ones appear to be located 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.100
 by the centrosome 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.909
 those that among others are short and in the form of ring with nine triplets of 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.970
 microtubules forming a supporting tissue 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.740
 When the cell begins to divide the cemeteries educate them and they can 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.230
 each pair moves to each daughter cell 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.540
 In cells that have cilia or flagella the centricos multiply they move 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.810
 to the surface of the cell and are arranged just behind the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 membrane forming basal bodies 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.530
 ten pairs of microtubules grow in each body goes salt a park bc in the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.239
 Basal body center 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.679
 this of the pairs are around the flail candle 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.329
 there is a cavity in the center of the subway had leo and the envelope is 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.779
 linked by motor proteins that make her move 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.579
 and the cross-linking of motor proteins make the microtubules 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
 flexes in 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:49.309
 the synchronized movement of those large ones and those of motor proteins that 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:53.079
 join the subway had allowed its movements from top to bottom of the 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 candles as well as the movement of the scourge 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.589
 Cilia as eyelashes are one more structure of the cell membrane 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.799
 the cilia move organisms as are the paramecia in their environment as 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.759
 continuous winds 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.000
 the scourge is considerably 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.309
 longer than candles, although in smaller numbers 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.389
 the flagellum moves faster 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.519
 the sperm of most animals use their flagella for 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.519
 move 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.499
 and several organisms like the nuclenor and 3 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.599
 the microtubules are believed 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.259
 who are involved with the movement of the principal organisms 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.339
 inside the cytoplasm 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.469
 one of the purposes is to hold vesicles or other organisms 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.540
 they have receptor proteins and she binds to the micro had what to take them from 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.719
 From one place to another 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.319
 cell engines 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.349
 destination through microtubules 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.349
