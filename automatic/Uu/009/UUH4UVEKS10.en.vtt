now<00:04:49.080> although<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.500> one<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.740> smaller<00:04:50.160> than

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
now although this one is smaller than

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.860 
now although this one is smaller than
the<00:04:50.550> other<00:04:50.669> one<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.970> other<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.150> actually<00:04:51.630> ran

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
the other one the other one actually ran

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.969 
the other one the other one actually ran
for<00:04:52.110> quite<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.349> while<00:04:52.700> but<00:04:53.700> here<00:04:53.970> we<00:04:54.090> are<00:04:54.120> I

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
for quite a while but here we are I

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.320 
for quite a while but here we are I
guess<00:04:55.979> we'll<00:04:56.160> take<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.520> last<00:04:56.550> look<00:04:56.910> you'll

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
guess we'll take one last look you'll

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.290 
guess we'll take one last look you'll
notice<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.870> his<00:04:58.200> legs<00:04:58.560> he's<00:04:59.520> wearing<00:05:00.000> some

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
notice that his legs he's wearing some

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.339 
notice that his legs he's wearing some

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
superior spider-man in spider-man

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.000 
superior spider-man in spider-man
unlimited<00:05:28.289> we<00:05:29.250> looked<00:05:29.460> at<00:05:29.639> every<00:05:30.060> part<00:05:30.389> of<00:05:30.539> his

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
unlimited we looked at every part of his

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.430 
unlimited we looked at every part of his
suit<00:05:32.010> so<00:05:32.340> far<00:05:32.669> of<00:05:32.849> course<00:05:32.880> he<00:05:33.240> he<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:34.349> know

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
suit so far of course he he you know

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.379 
suit so far of course he he you know
yeah<00:05:34.680> he<00:05:35.130> looks<00:05:35.340> like<00:05:35.430> he<00:05:35.550> has<00:05:35.610> more<00:05:35.849> muscles

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
yeah he looks like he has more muscles

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.150 
yeah he looks like he has more muscles
I'm<00:05:36.510> just<00:05:36.690> gonna<00:05:36.810> die<00:05:37.110> now<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.650> show<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:37.919> that

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
I'm just gonna die now and show you that

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.580 
I'm just gonna die now and show you that
I<00:05:38.430> mean<00:05:39.000> he<00:05:39.180> literally<00:05:39.720> looks<00:05:40.139> like<00:05:40.229> he<00:05:40.500> has

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
I mean he literally looks like he has

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.310 
I mean he literally looks like he has
more<00:05:40.770> muscles<00:05:41.360> kind<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.510> like<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.630> plastic<00:05:43.140> man

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
more muscles kind of like a plastic man

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.830 
more muscles kind of like a plastic man
actually<00:05:43.530> but<00:05:44.090> he<00:05:45.090> looks<00:05:45.270> like<00:05:45.330> he<00:05:45.510> has<00:05:45.539> more

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
actually but he looks like he has more

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.049 
actually but he looks like he has more
muscles<00:05:46.349> in<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:47.039> design

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.059 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.959 

so<00:05:51.059> we<00:05:51.179> didn't<00:05:51.330> get<00:05:51.449> our<00:05:51.599> stop<00:05:52.969> hopefully

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
so we didn't get our stop hopefully

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.850 
so we didn't get our stop hopefully
actually<00:05:54.509> Gameloft<00:05:55.020> is<00:05:55.229> not<00:05:55.409> going<00:05:55.559> to<00:05:55.649> care

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
actually Gameloft is not going to care

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.239 
actually Gameloft is not going to care
so<00:05:56.069> whatever<00:05:56.429> but<00:05:57.469> look<00:05:58.469> at<00:05:58.589> the<00:05:58.649> muscle<00:05:59.039> here

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 
so whatever but look at the muscle here

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.739 
so whatever but look at the muscle here
