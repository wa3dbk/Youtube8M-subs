00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
some of my wiring I will try to get a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.799 
some of my wiring I will try to get a
view<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.520> install<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.030> later

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
view of how I actually install it later

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.220 
view of how I actually install it later
to<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> guys<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:53.449> anyways<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
said this is the tsunami sound decoder

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
said this is the tsunami sound decoder
and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> actually<00:00:58.079> done<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and I would have actually done here is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.549 
and I would have actually done here is
installed<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.660> ather<00:01:00.660> ready<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.140> roll<00:01:01.320> white

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
installed a ather ready to roll white

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.460 
installed a ather ready to roll white
board<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.210> extra<00:01:03.570> couple<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
board I had an extra couple of these and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
board I had an extra couple of these and
that<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.790> helps<00:01:05.909> everything<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> be

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that just kind of helps everything to be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.649 
that just kind of helps everything to be
a<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:07.049> neater<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.600> helps<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a little bit neater and it also helps to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.219 
a little bit neater and it also helps to
cut<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> extra<00:01:11.430> wires<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
cut down on some of the extra wires that

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
cut down on some of the extra wires that
would<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.380> needed<00:01:13.970> I'm<00:01:14.970> also<00:01:15.119> another<00:01:15.479> thing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
would be needed I'm also another thing

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120 
would be needed I'm also another thing
here<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.259> may<00:01:16.470> notice<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.979> actually

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
here that you may notice is I actually

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.960 
here that you may notice is I actually
have<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.610> speakers<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.360> engine<00:01:19.880> as<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
have two speakers in this engine as you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.310 
have two speakers in this engine as you
can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.840> both<00:01:22.020> bass

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
can see here these are both bass

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.700 
can see here these are both bass
enhanced<00:01:23.030> rectangular<00:01:24.030> speakers<00:01:24.710> I've

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
enhanced rectangular speakers I've

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.600 
enhanced rectangular speakers I've
custom-made<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> baffles<00:01:27.030> form<00:01:28.430> I'll<00:01:29.430> show

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
custom-made the baffles form I'll show

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.039 
custom-made the baffles form I'll show
you<00:01:29.700> guys<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.060> wired<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you guys how I wired that in just a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
you guys how I wired that in just a
second<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> couple<00:01:32.100> other<00:01:32.250> tips<00:01:32.490> about

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
second but a couple other tips about

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.450 
second but a couple other tips about
mounting<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.390> speakers<00:01:34.009> as<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> see

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
mounting your speakers as you can see

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.859 
mounting your speakers as you can see
here<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.880> mounted<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
here I actually mounted them to the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.730 
here I actually mounted them to the
metal<00:01:37.170> frame<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.530> thing

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
metal frame and that will be one thing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.080 
metal frame and that will be one thing
that<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.040> helps<00:01:41.460> improve<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.909> sound

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that really helps improve the sound

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
that really helps improve the sound
quality<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.810> ever<00:01:43.140> mount<00:01:43.439> them<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
quality if you ever mount them to the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
quality if you ever mount them to the
shell<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.729> might<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.899> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
shell you might get a little bit of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
shell you might get a little bit of
store<00:01:46.350> ssin<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> shell<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.460> rattle

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
store ssin because the shell will rattle

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
store ssin because the shell will rattle
it<00:01:48.030> around<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.509> bit<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.020> not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it around a little bit if it's not

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.100 
it around a little bit if it's not
completely<00:01:49.590> secured<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.689> isn't<00:01:51.960> always

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
completely secured so it isn't always

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
completely secured so it isn't always
but<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.070> possible<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.180> definitely

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
but if it is possible I would definitely

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
but if it is possible I would definitely
recommend<00:01:54.899> mounting<00:01:55.740> them<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> frame<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
recommend mounting them to the frame and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
recommend mounting them to the frame and
as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.259> these<00:01:58.409> fit<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.920> perfectly

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
as you can see these fit just perfectly

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.690 
as you can see these fit just perfectly
on<00:01:59.640> each<00:01:59.820> side<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> motor<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:01.700> also

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
on each side of the motor here also

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
on each side of the motor here also
another<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.140> important

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
another thing that's very very important

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
another thing that's very very important
when<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:04.890> installing<00:02:05.189> speakers<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
when you're installing speakers is to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
when you're installing speakers is to
make<00:02:06.450> sure<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.740> baffle<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.280> 100%

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
make sure that your baffle is 100%

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.970 
make sure that your baffle is 100%
enclosed<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.229> any<00:02:10.379> gap

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
enclosed you don't want any gap

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.620 
enclosed you don't want any gap
because<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.160> will<00:02:12.400> reduce<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.150> sound

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
because that will reduce the sound

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.320 
because that will reduce the sound
volume<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.410> quality<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> as<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.270> see

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
volume and quality so as you can see

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.550 
volume and quality so as you can see
here<00:02:16.630> I've<00:02:16.720> got<00:02:16.900> everything<00:02:17.080> glued<00:02:17.410> together

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
here I've got everything glued together

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010 
here I've got everything glued together
I<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.430> made<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.940> baffle<00:02:19.420> out<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.630> styrene

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
I just made this baffle out of styrene

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.770 
I just made this baffle out of styrene
and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.830> used<00:02:21.010> some<00:02:21.100> putty<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:22.450> fill<00:02:22.660> in

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
and then I used some putty to fill in

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.390 
and then I used some putty to fill in
some<00:02:22.990> holes<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.530> cracks<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.160> might<00:02:24.280> have

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
some holes and cracks that might have

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
some holes and cracks that might have
been<00:02:24.490> alongside<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.860> glued<00:02:27.100> this

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
been alongside there and I glued this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
been alongside there and I glued this
down<00:02:27.460> with<00:02:27.640> CA<00:02:27.910> glue<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.540> make<00:02:28.720> sure<00:02:28.930> that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
down with CA glue just to make sure that

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.390 
down with CA glue just to make sure that
it's<00:02:29.320> really<00:02:29.410> not<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.920> anywhere<00:02:30.130> because

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it's really not going anywhere because

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.770 
it's really not going anywhere because
you<00:02:30.610> definitely<00:02:31.000> don't<00:02:31.090> want<00:02:31.300> your<00:02:31.420> speaker's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
you definitely don't want your speaker's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.250 
you definitely don't want your speaker's
rattling<00:02:32.260> around<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> high<00:02:35.410> why<00:02:35.680> are<00:02:35.740> these<00:02:36.090> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
rattling around so high why are these I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
rattling around so high why are these I
wired<00:02:38.260> these<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.860> parallel<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.750> series

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
wired these in parallel or in series

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.800 
wired these in parallel or in series
excuse<00:02:41.560> me<00:02:41.710> not<00:02:41.860> parallel<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:43.330> how<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.510> works

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
excuse me not parallel so how that works

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.450 
excuse me not parallel so how that works
is<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.230> two<00:02:44.440> speakers<00:02:44.740> coming<00:02:45.190> out<00:02:45.370> of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
is you have two speakers coming out of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.730 
is you have two speakers coming out of
your<00:02:45.550> decoder<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.270> speaker<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> did

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
your decoder for the speaker what I did

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.310 
your decoder for the speaker what I did
is<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.980> took<00:02:48.190> one<00:02:48.550> wire<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.090> went<00:02:49.690> into<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
is I took one wire and went into the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.430 
is I took one wire and went into the
positive<00:02:50.980> side<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.460> first<00:02:51.670> speaker<00:02:52.090> I

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
positive side of the first speaker I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
positive side of the first speaker I
took<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> second<00:02:53.950> wire<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.340> came<00:02:54.490> out<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
took a second wire and came out of the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.790 
took a second wire and came out of the
negative<00:02:55.540> side<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.960> first<00:02:56.200> speaker<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
negative side of the first speaker and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.380 
negative side of the first speaker and
went<00:02:57.220> into<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.490> positive<00:02:57.700> side<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.300> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
went into the positive side of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.770 
went into the positive side of the
second<00:02:58.780> speaker<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.380> then<00:03:00.250> took<00:03:00.520> another<00:03:01.510> wire

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
second speaker I then took another wire

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.420 
second speaker I then took another wire
and<00:03:02.110> looked<00:03:02.440> from<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.680> negative<00:03:03.010> side<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
and looked from the negative side of the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.600 
and looked from the negative side of the
second<00:03:03.850> speaker<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:04.570> back<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> decoder

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
second speaker and back to the decoder

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.940 
second speaker and back to the decoder
so<00:03:06.610> basically<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.330> took<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.560> speaker

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
so basically I just took a one speaker

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.760 
so basically I just took a one speaker
wire<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.550> went<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.940> decoder<00:03:10.770> take

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
wire and went to this decoder take

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.440 
wire and went to this decoder take
another<00:03:12.010> or<00:03:12.220> wire<00:03:12.400> went<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.090> decoder

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
another or wire went to that decoder

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.110 
another or wire went to that decoder
took<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> third<00:03:14.530> wire<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.160> went<00:03:15.400> back<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
took a third wire and went back to the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.920 
took a third wire and went back to the
decoder<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:18.520> that's<00:03:18.700> wiring<00:03:19.150> them<00:03:19.300> in<00:03:19.480> series

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
decoder so that's wiring them in series

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.470 
decoder so that's wiring them in series
if<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.739> wire<00:03:20.950> them<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.520> parallel<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.300> will

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
if you wire them in parallel you will

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.360 
if you wire them in parallel you will
exceed<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.140> load<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.800> decoder<00:03:24.070> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
exceed the load of the decoder and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.270 
exceed the load of the decoder and
that's<00:03:24.550> bad<00:03:24.880> cuz<00:03:25.330> it'll<00:03:25.480> overheat<00:03:25.810> hmm<00:03:26.410> all

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
that's bad cuz it'll overheat hmm all

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.199 
that's bad cuz it'll overheat hmm all
that<00:03:27.459> good<00:03:28.209> stuff<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.880> anyways<00:03:30.880> that's<00:03:31.030> how<00:03:31.150> I

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
that good stuff so anyways that's how I

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.270 
that good stuff so anyways that's how I
do<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.570> these<00:03:31.780> are<00:03:31.840> 8<00:03:32.200> ohm<00:03:32.380> based<00:03:32.739> enhanced

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
do that these are 8 ohm based enhanced

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.350 
do that these are 8 ohm based enhanced
speakers<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:36.070> want<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.370> there's<00:03:37.120> some

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360

lights these are the LED LEDs that I use
let's<00:04:03.070> see<00:04:03.250> if<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.610> pick<00:04:04.330> one<00:04:04.360> up<00:04:04.630> here<00:04:04.870> you

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
let's see if I can pick one up here you

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.250 
let's see if I can pick one up here you
can<00:04:05.350> see<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.769> they're<00:04:05.980> very<00:04:06.630> small<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:08.110> is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
can see that they're very small this is

can see that they're very small this is
what<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.530> LED<00:04:08.860> actually<00:04:09.220> looks<00:04:09.459> like<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.940> can

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
what the LED actually looks like I can

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.380 
what the LED actually looks like I can
give<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.140> focus<00:04:11.620> here<00:04:11.830> let's<00:04:12.820> see<00:04:13.030> if<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.209> can

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
give it to focus here let's see if I can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.110 
give it to focus here let's see if I can
find<00:04:13.600> it

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
find it

that close but what I do is I put a
little<00:04:27.650> glue<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.280> back<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.030> then

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
little glue on the back of that and then

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.480 
little glue on the back of that and then
I<00:04:30.199> will<00:04:30.610> glue<00:04:31.610> them<00:04:31.790> into<00:04:32.030> my<00:04:33.400> digital<00:04:34.400> light

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
I will glue them into my digital light

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.010 
I will glue them into my digital light
castings<00:04:35.060> these<00:04:35.389> are<00:04:35.540> actually<00:04:35.840> made<00:04:35.960> by

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
castings these are actually made by

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.350 
castings these are actually made by
miniatures<00:04:36.650> by<00:04:36.860> Eric<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.790> just<00:04:38.090> glue<00:04:38.300> them

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
miniatures by Eric but I just glue them

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.939 
miniatures by Eric but I just glue them
into<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.660> back<00:04:38.840> there<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.470> front<00:04:39.860> is

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
into the back there so the front is

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.590 
into the back there so the front is
facing<00:04:40.370> forward<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:42.880> as<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.180> see<00:04:44.360> there

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
facing forward and as you can see there

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.650 
facing forward and as you can see there
it<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.979> in<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.190> casting<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.940> there<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:47.540> is

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
it is in the casting and there it is

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.170 
it is in the casting and there it is
added<00:04:48.080> casting<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:49.240> there's<00:04:50.240> my<00:04:52.000> finger<00:04:53.000> just

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
added casting and there's my finger just

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.090 
added casting and there's my finger just
