this thing does with the small fog

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.760 
this thing does with the small fog
machine<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.470> once<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:30.009> know<00:00:30.070> what<00:00:30.339> it<00:00:30.429> does

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
machine and once I know what it does

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.080 
machine and once I know what it does
I'll<00:00:32.770> know<00:00:33.010> what<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.280> would<00:00:33.550> it's<00:00:33.730> like<00:00:33.940> with

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
I'll know what it would it's like with

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.360 
I'll know what it would it's like with
the<00:00:34.210> bigger<00:00:34.390> one<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.980> first<00:00:36.219> shot

the bigger one this is the first shot
I'm<00:00:36.520> gonna<00:00:36.700> do<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.960> I<00:00:38.260> want<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.010> see<00:00:39.190> raw<00:00:39.430> how<00:00:39.670> it

I'm gonna do so I want to see raw how it
comes<00:00:40.030> out<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:42.539> drilled<00:00:43.539> holes<00:00:43.600> used<00:00:44.350> swinish

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
comes out I drilled holes used swinish

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.400 
comes out I drilled holes used swinish
diameter<00:00:45.190> couplers<00:00:45.640> 2<00:00:46.120> inch<00:00:46.329> diameter<00:00:46.480> PVC<00:00:46.930> I

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
diameter couplers 2 inch diameter PVC I

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.069 
diameter couplers 2 inch diameter PVC I
have<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.370> nozzle<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.149> I<00:00:49.300> made<00:00:49.480> it's<00:00:49.660> optional

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
have a nozzle that I made it's optional

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.180 
have a nozzle that I made it's optional
I<00:00:50.170> cut<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.469> at<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.680> slant<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.539> when<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.949> fog

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
I cut it at a slant so that when the fog

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.189 
I cut it at a slant so that when the fog
comes<00:00:54.430> out<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.940> kind<00:00:55.329> of<00:00:55.390> hits<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.719> top<00:00:55.960> it

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
comes out it kind of hits the top it

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.590 
comes out it kind of hits the top it
starts<00:00:56.379> coming<00:00:56.739> down<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.010> little<00:00:57.070> lower<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.390> I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
starts coming down a little lower and I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.540 
starts coming down a little lower and I
have<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.019> like<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.649> on<00:00:59.859> the<00:00:59.949> coupler<00:01:00.160> just

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
have that like that on the coupler just

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.369 
have that like that on the coupler just
to<00:01:00.640> make<00:01:00.789> sure<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.570> if<00:01:01.719> one<00:01:01.899> doesn't<00:01:02.079> work

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
to make sure that if one doesn't work

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.230 
to make sure that if one doesn't work
the<00:01:02.859> other<00:01:02.920> one<00:01:03.129> works<00:01:03.280> better<00:01:03.579> but<00:01:03.910> I'll<00:01:04.030> try

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.240 
the other one works better but I'll try

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.770 
the other one works better but I'll try
it<00:01:04.300> both<00:01:04.420> ways<00:01:04.750> ah<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:07.390> on<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:08.740> side<00:01:09.010> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it both ways ah now on this side I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.430 
it both ways ah now on this side I
drilled<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.870> hole<00:01:10.900> through<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.940> side<00:01:13.300> put<00:01:14.230> two

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
drilled a hole through the side put two

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.220 
drilled a hole through the side put two
90<00:01:14.770> degree<00:01:15.130> elbows<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:16.480> is<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.750> receiving

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
90 degree elbows this is the receiving

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.040 
90 degree elbows this is the receiving
end<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:18.490> was<00:01:19.060> watching<00:01:19.420> some<00:01:19.570> stuff<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
end I was watching some stuff and the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.080 
end I was watching some stuff and the
best<00:01:20.230> result<00:01:20.560> said<00:01:20.920> keep<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:21.760> few<00:01:21.940> inches

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
best result said keep it a few inches

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.600 
best result said keep it a few inches
away<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.510> keep<00:01:22.750> get<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> air<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.620> come<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:24.460> and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
away to keep get the air to come in and

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.840 
away to keep get the air to come in and
help<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:24.910> move<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:26.010> I'll<00:01:27.010> try<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.580> but<00:01:27.820> I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
help it move and I'll try that but I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.610 
help it move and I'll try that but I
think<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:28.330> better<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.600> put<00:01:28.870> it<00:01:28.960> right<00:01:29.290> up<00:01:29.470> to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
think it's better to put it right up to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.490 
think it's better to put it right up to
the<00:01:29.710> nozzle<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.420> bigger<00:01:31.780> machines

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
the nozzle with the bigger machines

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.380 
the nozzle with the bigger machines
I<00:01:32.530> think<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.040> got<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.340> leave<00:01:34.060> some<00:01:34.270> space

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
I think you got to leave some space

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.580 
I think you got to leave some space
because<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.050> heat<00:01:35.260> creates<00:01:35.890> down<00:01:36.160> here

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
because the heat creates down here

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.630 
because the heat creates down here
inside<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:38.920> put<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.430> grill<00:01:39.730> I<00:01:40.260> bent<00:01:41.260> by<00:01:41.440> hand<00:01:41.770> it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
inside I put a grill I bent by hand it

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.690 
inside I put a grill I bent by hand it
goes<00:01:43.000> sideways<00:01:43.330> from<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.870> top<00:01:44.110> side<00:01:44.700> across

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
goes sideways from the top side across

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.230 
goes sideways from the top side across
the<00:01:45.880> bottom<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.290> my<00:01:47.440> ice<00:01:47.680> it's<00:01:48.070> all<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.030> top

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the bottom so my ice it's all on the top

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.720 
the bottom so my ice it's all on the top
portion<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:50.590> leaves<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.920> air<00:01:51.160> space<00:01:51.490> down

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
portion or leaves the air space down

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.060 
portion or leaves the air space down
here<00:01:51.760> for<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.300> father<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.750> come<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.140> hit<00:01:53.440> and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
here for the father to come in hit and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.820 
here for the father to come in hit and
work<00:01:54.220> its<00:01:54.430> way<00:01:54.610> back<00:01:55.360> out<00:01:55.570> let's<00:01:56.410> take<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.650> look

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
work its way back out let's take a look

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.520 
work its way back out let's take a look
inside

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
inside

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.420 
inside
here<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.940> nozzle<00:02:00.120> and<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.890> cut<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> at

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
here I have the nozzle and I cut that at

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.070 
here I have the nozzle and I cut that at
a<00:02:02.490> sign<00:02:02.730> also<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.450> hits<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> ice

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
a sign also so that it hits the ice

out once that fogger warms up again

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.280 
out once that fogger warms up again
we'll<00:03:50.000> hit<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.269> one<00:03:50.390> more<00:03:50.420> time<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.019> see<00:03:51.170> what

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.230 

coming<00:04:59.260> out<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.410> lot<00:04:59.620> thicker

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
coming out a lot thicker

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:29.799 
coming out a lot thicker
when<00:05:01.750> they<00:05:01.840> are<00:05:01.990> real<00:05:02.199> nice

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:29.809 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:40.590 

that's<00:05:30.809> nice

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.930 

I<00:05:40.690> worked<00:05:41.350> up<00:05:41.500> pretty<00:05:41.680> cool<00:05:42.160> plus<00:05:42.340> I<00:05:42.460> got<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.640> fan

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
I worked up pretty cool plus I got a fan

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.680 
I worked up pretty cool plus I got a fan
running<00:05:43.120> over<00:05:43.420> there

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
running over there

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.420 
running over there
not<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.290> make<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.590> move<00:05:44.770> it's<00:05:45.010> just<00:05:45.070> so<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.340> can

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
not to make it move it's just so I can

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.890 
not to make it move it's just so I can
get<00:05:45.610> out<00:05:45.820> of<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.000> building<00:05:46.180> as<00:05:46.450> soon<00:05:46.480> as<00:05:46.810> it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
get out of the building as soon as it

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.270 
get out of the building as soon as it
starts<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.170> problem<00:05:47.560> over<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:47.920> it's<00:05:48.040> putting

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
starts to problem over so it's putting

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.050 
starts to problem over so it's putting
it<00:05:48.460> out<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.670> here<00:05:48.760> faster<00:05:49.210> than<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:51.490> intended

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
it out of here faster than then intended

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.100 
it out of here faster than then intended
you<00:05:52.150> know<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.390> supposed<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:52.660> stay<00:05:52.900> around

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
you know it's supposed to stay around

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.400 
you know it's supposed to stay around
but<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.910> second<00:05:55.420> spray<00:05:55.720> with<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.260> other

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
but the second spray with that other

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.440 
but the second spray with that other
nozzle<00:05:56.920> off<00:05:57.100> was<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.520> lot<00:05:57.760> better<00:05:57.970> so<00:05:58.210> I<00:05:58.240> guess

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
nozzle off was a lot better so I guess

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.230 
nozzle off was a lot better so I guess
I'll<00:05:58.630> recommend<00:05:59.100> leaving<00:06:00.100> that<00:06:00.400> nozzle<00:06:00.850> just

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
I'll recommend leaving that nozzle just

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.920 
I'll recommend leaving that nozzle just
the<00:06:01.390> way<00:06:01.510> it<00:06:01.630> is<00:06:02.400> you<00:06:03.400> know<00:06:03.570> actually<00:06:04.570> the

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
the way it is you know actually the

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.450 
the way it is you know actually the
first<00:06:05.260> parade<00:06:05.440> was<00:06:05.620> also<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:05.920> short<00:06:06.160> spray

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
first parade was also a short spray

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.340 
first parade was also a short spray
because<00:06:06.820> uh<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:07.830> didn't<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:09.220> know<00:06:10.230> have<00:06:11.230> the

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
because uh I didn't you know have the

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.310 
because uh I didn't you know have the
cooler<00:06:11.650> foot<00:06:11.920> it<00:06:12.610> has<00:06:12.670> to<00:06:12.970> fill<00:06:13.240> up<00:06:13.390> the<00:06:13.540> smoke

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
cooler foot it has to fill up the smoke

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.650 
cooler foot it has to fill up the smoke
I<00:06:14.470> guess<00:06:14.710> build<00:06:15.310> up<00:06:15.550> cuz<00:06:16.060> if<00:06:16.180> you<00:06:16.210> open<00:06:16.540> this

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
I guess build up cuz if you open this

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.140 
I guess build up cuz if you open this
you<00:06:17.560> see<00:06:17.740> all<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:17.980> smoke<00:06:18.400> come<00:06:18.700> up<00:06:18.820> and<00:06:19.000> one

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
you see all the smoke come up and one

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
you see all the smoke come up and one
that's<00:06:19.330> just<00:06:19.540> left<00:06:19.780> in<00:06:19.930> there<00:06:20.110> you<00:06:20.230> know<00:06:20.730> so

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
that's just left in there you know so

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.410 
that's just left in there you know so
when<00:06:23.170> this<00:06:23.290> machine<00:06:23.500> warms<00:06:23.920> up<00:06:24.070> again<00:06:24.210> we<00:06:25.210> try

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
when this machine warms up again we try

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.610 
when this machine warms up again we try
it<00:06:25.480> again<00:06:25.540> with<00:06:25.810> the<00:06:25.900> other<00:06:25.990> nozzle<00:06:26.440> that<00:06:26.500> I'm

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
it again with the other nozzle that I'm

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.070 
it again with the other nozzle that I'm
putting<00:06:26.830> back<00:06:27.100> on<00:06:27.420> just<00:06:28.420> to<00:06:28.510> see<00:06:28.540> how<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.930> kind

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
putting back on just to see how it kind

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.540 
putting back on just to see how it kind
of<00:06:29.230> floats<00:06:29.470> back<00:06:29.650> out<00:06:29.890> there<00:06:30.070> and<00:06:30.160> maybe<00:06:30.370> it'll

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
of floats back out there and maybe it'll

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.180 
of floats back out there and maybe it'll
give<00:06:30.670> it<00:06:30.700> a<00:06:30.790> little<00:06:30.910> longer<00:06:31.270> throw<00:06:31.980> but<00:06:32.980> that's

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
give it a little longer throw but that's

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.740 
give it a little longer throw but that's
cool

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
cool

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.480 
cool

little creepy
we'll<00:06:38.860> give<00:06:38.980> it<00:06:39.010> one<00:06:39.100> more<00:06:39.340> shot<00:06:39.370> soon<00:06:39.820> as<00:06:39.910> this

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
we'll give it one more shot soon as this

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.870 
we'll give it one more shot soon as this
thing<00:06:40.060> warms<00:06:40.480> up<00:06:40.950> by<00:06:41.950> like<00:06:42.100> I<00:06:42.220> said<00:06:42.430> everything

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
thing warms up by like I said everything

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.010 
thing warms up by like I said everything
was<00:06:42.970> like<00:06:43.150> thirty<00:06:43.420> bucks<00:06:43.720> man<00:06:44.050> I<00:06:45.180> used<00:06:46.180> the

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
was like thirty bucks man I used the

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.460 
was like thirty bucks man I used the
whole<00:06:47.200> sauce<00:06:48.450> was<00:06:49.450> a<00:06:49.480> two<00:06:49.840> and<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:50.020> half<00:06:50.200> inch

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
whole sauce was a two and a half inch

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.320 
whole sauce was a two and a half inch
when<00:06:51.100> you<00:06:51.130> buy<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.430> whole<00:06:51.700> saw<00:06:51.910> to<00:06:51.970> cut<00:06:52.210> these

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
when you buy the whole saw to cut these

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.600 
when you buy the whole saw to cut these
holes<00:06:52.420> because<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.500> diameter<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:54.220> outside

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
holes because the diameter the outside

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.420 
holes because the diameter the outside
of<00:06:54.760> this<00:06:55.110> is<00:06:56.110> not<00:06:56.410> measured<00:06:56.740> at<00:06:56.860> two<00:06:57.010> inch<00:06:57.190> it's

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
of this is not measured at two inch it's

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.980 
of this is not measured at two inch it's
the<00:06:57.550> inside<00:06:57.910> diameter<00:06:58.120> that<00:06:58.510> pipe<00:06:58.750> and<00:06:58.960> that

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
the inside diameter that pipe and that

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.830 
the inside diameter that pipe and that
pipe<00:06:59.230> is<00:06:59.380> kind<00:06:59.620> of<00:06:59.680> thick<00:07:00.090> so

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
pipe is kind of thick so

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.890 
pipe is kind of thick so
again<00:07:02.710> we'll<00:07:02.920> wait<00:07:03.120> to<00:07:04.120> the<00:07:04.210> machine<00:07:04.510> arms<00:07:04.750> up

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
again we'll wait to the machine arms up

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.920 
again we'll wait to the machine arms up
again

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
again

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.390 
again
that<00:07:07.930> fans<00:07:08.230> moving<00:07:08.590> that<00:07:08.740> smoke<00:07:08.980> out<00:07:09.190> of<00:07:09.220> here

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
that fans moving that smoke out of here

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.320 
that fans moving that smoke out of here
pretty<00:07:09.580> good<00:07:09.820> a<00:07:10.120> pretty<00:07:10.780> good<00:07:11.139> sized<00:07:11.350> fan<00:07:11.650> I

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
pretty good a pretty good sized fan I

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.520 
pretty good a pretty good sized fan I
got<00:07:13.330> a<00:07:13.360> much<00:07:13.570> bigger<00:07:13.780> fan<00:07:14.080> over<00:07:14.260> there<00:07:14.380> in<00:07:14.440> the

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
got a much bigger fan over there in the

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.240 
got a much bigger fan over there in the
corner<00:07:15.510> but<00:07:16.510> that<00:07:16.720> I<00:07:16.960> would<00:07:17.440> almost<00:07:17.590> recommend

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
corner but that I would almost recommend

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.700 
corner but that I would almost recommend
that<00:07:18.370> if<00:07:18.490> you're<00:07:18.639> outdoors<00:07:19.260> to<00:07:20.260> put<00:07:20.440> a<00:07:20.470> fan

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
that if you're outdoors to put a fan

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.140 
that if you're outdoors to put a fan
like<00:07:20.830> that<00:07:21.010> so<00:07:21.130> it<00:07:21.220> kind<00:07:21.370> of<00:07:21.520> pulls<00:07:21.760> it<00:07:21.880> across

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
like that so it kind of pulls it across

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.000 
like that so it kind of pulls it across
the<00:07:22.360> yard<00:07:22.600> but<00:07:22.870> not<00:07:23.020> not<00:07:23.290> such<00:07:23.500> a<00:07:23.530> big<00:07:23.800> fan

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
the yard but not not such a big fan

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.450 
the yard but not not such a big fan
where<00:07:24.160> it's<00:07:24.280> getting<00:07:24.460> rid<00:07:24.730> of<00:07:24.790> it<00:07:26.370> there<00:07:27.370> you

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
where it's getting rid of it there you

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:39.710 
where it's getting rid of it there you
go<00:07:27.550> again

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.350

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:53.370

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:53.380 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.869 

absolutely

00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:02.680 

now<00:08:00.360> you<00:08:00.419> know<00:08:00.719> this<00:08:00.869> is

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690 
now you know this is

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.010

so<00:08:02.840> this<00:08:03.050> away

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.020 
so this away

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.869 
so this away
a<00:08:05.050> little<00:08:05.530> better<00:08:05.650> for<00:08:05.770> your<00:08:06.069> eyes<00:08:06.160> to<00:08:06.430> keep<00:08:06.699> it

a little better for your eyes to keep it

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:12.089 
a little better for your eyes to keep it
all<00:08:06.970> about
