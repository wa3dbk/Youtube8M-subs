00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.459
 the next system that i have 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.780
 I met for which I boiled very 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.470
 a lot of money your time 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.980
 or rather, for the algorithm to write 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.820
 trading robot on this system is difficult 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:30.100
 say repulsed or this money but I think 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.259
 that having beaten off a little I mean to you 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.309
 I recommend it really works but 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.980
 she is very critical to quotas 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.980
 slippage to execution of orders 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.960
 so the broker should be 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.079
 reinforced concrete and that he took 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.550
 minimum commission or minimum 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.620
 spread it all rests and unfortunately 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.420
 i quit this system because i don't 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.120
 met a normal adequate broker 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.870
 which will give my access without reg 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.299
 here without slipping with normal 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.920
 performance and at the same time that he had 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.920
 normal commission either 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 the spread, that is, the spread would be fixed 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.000
 what i mean did i didn't invent this 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.960
 I say the system immediately, let me not its author 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.210
 absolutely nevertheless I did 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 next we have 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 minutes 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.679
 if someone algorithms guys 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.890
 skinte me too because 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.810
 I have already deleted this advisers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.109
 I wanted to remember so let's say youth 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 what 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:51.869
 and we have intraday movements i 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.209
 a little bit wrong you drew 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.119
 excuse me now let me do 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:06.000
 differently here we have movement here such 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:12.110
 how do you somehow go like this here with us 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.299
 minutes and here we include the following we 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.110
 set two moving averages with 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.280
 short period 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.170
 vskidku guys here do not remember but 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.220
 I used the third period 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 we build one at the opening prices of the other 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.079
 at closing prices in the end we have 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.470
 such is formed here 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:41.010
 a corridor of two moving averages 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.299
 this we have one moving average here 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.299
 we have another moving average 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:58.760
 then what happens if we have a price 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.200
 hits let's say in some kind of sliding 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:11.270
 medium but there opens a deal 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:14.770
 on sell a stack profit there are two 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.510
 profit left one for the price from 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.440
 actually came to the point 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.100
 where did the price come from and the second stop here 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.220
 of course here we have one 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.770
 an important moment is needed here 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.920
 filter saw how to learn 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.930
 filter saw in this system i 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.830
 I will not lie plainly and did not learn 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.670
 and could not filter it and I refused 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.920
 in the end from her because the aggregate 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.950
 factors and the broker could not find 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.280
 Normal, I tried well doherischa 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:57.200
 About 15 brokers have changed these 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.250
 more or less adequate and beyond that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.560
 also saw in general here I earned 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.340
 Of course this system but the money was 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 small 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.030
 if someone knows how to filter the saw 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.410
 according to this system he knows and can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.510
 make the algorithm throw me a kindness 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.989
 his soulful and so on to immediately 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.970
 I say I will not buy it that is 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.540
 purely here on your some kind of altruism 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.440
 nonetheless if there is someone who writes 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.730
 advisors try to really work but 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.640
 need to filter saws 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.670
 This is what I recommend for sliding 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.670
 and I would like to consider here
