00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.480 

right<00:00:00.690> in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.930> final<00:00:01.350> video<00:00:01.469> on<00:00:01.829> shale<00:00:02.250> so

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
right in this final video on shale so

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.430 
right in this final video on shale so
I'm<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> go<00:00:03.000> through<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.510> list<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:04.020> seven

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
I'm going to go through a list of seven

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
I'm going to go through a list of seven
numbers<00:00:04.799> just<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.730> see<00:00:05.970> there<00:00:06.359> are<00:00:06.480> some

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
numbers just to see there are some

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.080 
numbers just to see there are some
different<00:00:07.109> variations<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.639> see<00:00:08.820> what

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
different variations and to see what

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.830 
different variations and to see what
really<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.719> happen<00:00:10.940> three<00:00:11.940> one<00:00:12.150> two<00:00:12.360> seven

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
really can happen three one two seven

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070 
really can happen three one two seven
five<00:00:13.230> six<00:00:13.559> four<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.849> you've<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.690> seven

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
five six four so you've got seven

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.990 
five six four so you've got seven
numbers<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.039> want<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> find<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> integer

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
numbers and you want to find the integer

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.349 
numbers and you want to find the integer
part<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.570> seven<00:00:18.960> over<00:00:19.320> two<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.550> seven<00:00:21.090> over<00:00:21.270> two

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
part of seven over two so seven over two

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.810 
part of seven over two so seven over two
is<00:00:21.750> three<00:00:21.960> point<00:00:22.350> five<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> integer<00:00:23.609> part

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
is three point five so the integer part

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.120 
is three point five so the integer part
is<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> three<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
is just the three so we're going to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
is just the three so we're going to
split<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> into<00:00:26.789> three<00:00:27.330> sub<00:00:28.289> lists<00:00:29.150> okay<00:00:30.150> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
split it into three sub lists okay so

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.990 
split it into three sub lists okay so
we've<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:31.759> three<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:34.730> then<00:00:35.730> seven<00:00:36.540> five

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
we've got three one two then seven five

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.290 
we've got three one two then seven five
six<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.410> fall<00:00:40.770> okay<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.059> see

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
six and then fall okay so you can see

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
six and then fall okay so you can see
that<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> case<00:00:43.230> before<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.649> left

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that in this case before up here is left

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.240 
that in this case before up here is left
alone<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.230> left<00:00:49.500> alone<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> sense

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
alone but not left alone in the sense

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.029 
alone but not left alone in the sense
that<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.610> ignore<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> sub

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that we ignore it because this is a sub

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.880 
that we ignore it because this is a sub
list<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> sub<00:00:54.780> list<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.680> sub

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
list this is a sub list and that's a sub

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.420 
list this is a sub list and that's a sub
list<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.059> an<00:00:57.180> unusual<00:00:57.690> case<00:00:58.340> for<00:00:59.340> this

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
list so this is an unusual case for this

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
list so this is an unusual case for this
example<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> question<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.289> I'm

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
example to do a question like this I'm

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.869 
example to do a question like this I'm
just<00:01:01.770> showing<00:01:01.980> exactly<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:02.850> work

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just showing exactly how it would work

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.830 
just showing exactly how it would work
so<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.220> three<00:01:05.460> seven<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so the three seven for that would be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
so the three seven for that would be
shuttle<00:01:07.320> sorted<00:01:07.710> okay<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:09.030> get

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
shuttle sorted okay so we would get

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
shuttle sorted okay so we would get
three<00:01:10.070> four<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.430> seven<00:01:12.560> we<00:01:13.560> would<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.799> one

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
three four and seven we would have one

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
three four and seven we would have one
five<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:15.740> five<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> six<00:01:18.000> again<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
five one five the two and six again so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.570 
five one five the two and six again so
notice<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.770> need<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.220> made<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.549> either

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
notice what need to be made on either

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
notice what need to be made on either
those<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.180> comparisons<00:01:23.570> from<00:01:24.570> having<00:01:25.140> three

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
those two comparisons from having three

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
those two comparisons from having three
sub<00:01:26.790> lists<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> integer<00:01:28.799> part

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sub lists you then do the integer part

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
sub lists you then do the integer part
of<00:01:29.420> 3<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.900> 2<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.439> third<00:01:32.070> -<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> 1.5<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of 3 over 2 or third - is 1.5 so the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
of 3 over 2 or third - is 1.5 so the
integer<00:01:34.740> part<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.490> would

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
integer part is just one so you would

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
integer part is just one so you would
then<00:01:40.100> finally<00:01:41.100> shuttle<00:01:41.939> saw<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.689> seven

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
then finally shuttle saw the seven

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.399 
then finally shuttle saw the seven
numbers<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.540> three<00:01:45.960> four

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
numbers and you get one two three four

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
numbers and you get one two three four
five<00:01:46.979> six<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.680> okay<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.630> where<00:01:51.630> we

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
five six so okay and that's where we

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
five six so okay and that's where we
would<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.729> mean<00:01:53.729> any<00:01:54.950> large<00:01:55.950> list<00:01:56.340> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
would get to I mean any large list of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
would get to I mean any large list of
numbers<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> recommend<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.869> start<00:01:58.229> with

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
numbers when I recommend you start with

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.120 
numbers when I recommend you start with
you<00:01:59.340> keep<00:01:59.610> having<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> integer<00:02:01.590> part<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you keep having the integer part of the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.109 
you keep having the integer part of the
previous<00:02:02.759> number<00:02:04.040> okay<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.850> get

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
previous number okay and when you get

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139 
previous number okay and when you get
down<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.190> sub<00:02:08.910> list

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
down to one you have this one sub list

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.650 
down to one you have this one sub list
that<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.250> finally

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that you then finally

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.700 
that you then finally
shot<00:02:13.660> assault<00:02:14.280> okay<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.390> how<00:02:16.710> shale

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
shot assault okay so that is how shale

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.700 
shot assault okay so that is how shale
salt<00:02:18.160> works
