00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.030
 flame maybe i would like 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.009
 talking to him 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.559
 to what a blur to think 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.269
 otherwise, everything is asking you questions 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.970
 would you answer when I speak above 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.660
 the power of the world let everyone into this notion 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.289
 puts something of its own 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.150
 the idea is such a gisha something bigger than us and we 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.990
 to this more we can connect 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.990
 hand over 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.240
 high power 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.590
 The fact is that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.240
 the main psychological 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.820
 overweight person 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580
 this propensity is excessive control 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.970
 and canceled those around 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.100
 imagine thatâ€™s why 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.220
 dear webinar participants 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.230
 gain weight and choose a place deal 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 that weight is very symbolic 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.010
 substance turns our places 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.530
 very accurately reflects our attitude to the world 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.730
 when you gain weight it means that 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.020
 you try to get big 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 so bear big in russia more tolerated 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.790
 more that is his and very very 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.480
 prone to what we will 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.860
 makes villages 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.160
 what can 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.020
 sustain your country 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.140
 appetite 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 body starts to gain weight 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 this propensity of excessive control 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.540
 in all this 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.410
 anapa segment know yourself for sure often 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.960
 trying to change 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 yeah baby how long have I not been a cat he 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.049
 I myself his as soon as not with him 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.810
 have worked 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.439
 he continued to do it and only through 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.700
 year, I realized that Omsk 8 m can not do 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 colleagues but very often 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.450
 the percentage of children is correct 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.690
 the fact is that they read people 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 Paul is another man the whole universe 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990
 controlling it is very difficult and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.110
 so places are typed 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.679
 but if then how do i lead groups 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.789
 to reduce weight loss world see 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.710
 here is not talking with his 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.990
 clients by patient participants 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.740
 i teach them to be weak and give up than 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.760
 more than 3 the less you can endure 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.750
 the weight goes faster but the star 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.420
 prayer but it turns out 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.389
 give up 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.219
 and because we are stupid not because my 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.779
 percent 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.409
 I do not understand something 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.239
 we understand that without burden 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.459
 it would be easier to live but we do not believe that there is 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.649
 someone who will help us we do not believe 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.519
 but we do not believe in the image of the world 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.769
 to a large extent 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.019
 percentage seems to us that if we are percentage 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.090
 put on studio luggage like this 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.319
 difficult to name 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.699
 but something bad will happen
