much of fingerprints
on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.740> back<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.030> lighting<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.510> good

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
on the back so the lighting is good

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.310 
on the back so the lighting is good
enough<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.020> can<00:02:14.110> kinda<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.870> get<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> good

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
enough so you can kinda just get a good

a 16 gig version but battery is getting
low<00:02:36.220> looks<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.790> they<00:02:36.880> may<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.120> shipped<00:02:37.390> it
