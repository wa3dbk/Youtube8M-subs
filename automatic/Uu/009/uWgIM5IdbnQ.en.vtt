really was one of the highlights of the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
really was one of the highlights of the
film<00:02:18.870> even<00:02:19.170> more<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.680> than<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> first<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
film even more so than in the first the

amazing spider-man but let's be honest
we<00:02:23.640> don't<00:02:23.670> go<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.420> spider-man<00:02:25.140> movie<00:02:25.470> for

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
we don't go to a spider-man movie for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010 
we don't go to a spider-man movie for
beautiful<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> emotional<00:02:26.670> moments<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.870> go

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
beautiful and emotional moments we go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
beautiful and emotional moments we go
for<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> action<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.370> where<00:02:30.030> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
for the action and that's where this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090 
for the action and that's where this
movie<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.810> fell<00:02:31.020> flat<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.440> me<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
movie kind of fell flat for me but I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.190 
movie kind of fell flat for me but I
will<00:02:32.459> get<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.420> second<00:02:33.810> more

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
will get to that in just a second more

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.320 
will get to that in just a second more
positive<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.459> for<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> most<00:02:36.060> part

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
positive so I think for the most part

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.030 
positive so I think for the most part
the<00:02:36.450> cast<00:02:36.690> was<00:02:36.930> strong<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.380> still<00:02:37.650> liked<00:02:37.770> Andrew

throughout<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.160> whole<00:04:26.460> movie<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.210> checked<00:04:27.570> my

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
throughout the whole movie I checked my

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.280 
throughout the whole movie I checked my
watch<00:04:27.750> once<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:30.570> that's<00:04:30.780> something<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.229> I

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
watch once and that's something that I

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.990 
watch once and that's something that I
never<00:04:31.620> want<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.919> say<00:04:32.160> coming<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.760> of<00:04:32.940> a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000

never want to say coming out of a
superhero<00:04:33.540> movie<00:04:33.930> I'll<00:04:34.470> admit<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.979> maybe

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
superhero movie I'll admit that maybe

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.430 
superhero movie I'll admit that maybe
I'm<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> little<00:04:35.639> spoiled<00:04:36.210> by<00:04:36.300> how<00:04:36.450> much<00:04:36.630> Marvel

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
I'm a little spoiled by how much Marvel

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.930 
I'm a little spoiled by how much Marvel
and<00:04:37.620> Warner<00:04:37.860> Brothers<00:04:38.010> have<00:04:38.370> been<00:04:38.490> able<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.729> do

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and Warner Brothers have been able to do

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
and Warner Brothers have been able to do
with<00:04:39.060> their<00:04:39.210> superhero<00:04:39.720> films<00:04:40.020> over<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.320> last

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
with their superhero films over the last

with their superhero films over the last
six<00:04:40.800> years<00:04:40.889> or<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.970> Sony<00:04:42.270> has<00:04:42.570> all<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.900> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
six years or so but Sony has all of the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.770 
six years or so but Sony has all of the
same<00:04:43.650> resources<00:04:44.310> other<00:04:44.669> studios<00:04:45.210> have<00:04:45.510> now

one<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.050> my<00:04:46.140> biggest<00:04:46.350> critiques<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.130> the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
one of my biggest critiques is that the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.240 
one of my biggest critiques is that the
CGI<00:04:47.700> effects<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:49.080> action<00:04:49.530> we<00:04:49.650> did<00:04:49.950> see

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
CGI effects of the action we did see

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.190 
CGI effects of the action we did see
which<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.669> saw<00:04:50.880> also<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.539> trailers

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
which I saw also in the trailers

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.710 
which I saw also in the trailers
was<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.010> over-the-top<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.910> cheesy<00:04:54.180> sometimes

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
was so over-the-top and cheesy sometimes

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.240 
was so over-the-top and cheesy sometimes
that<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:54.990> felt<00:04:55.200> like<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.410> was<00:04:55.560> watching<00:04:56.100> an

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
that it felt like I was watching an

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.060 
that it felt like I was watching an
animated<00:04:56.970> movie<00:04:57.180> or<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.780> video<00:04:58.200> game<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.770> not<00:04:59.039> a

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
animated movie or a video game and not a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.100 
animated movie or a video game and not a
live-action<00:04:59.490> film<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.900> they

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
live-action film it's like they

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.740 
live-action film it's like they
sacrifice<00:05:01.680> realistic<00:05:02.520> action<00:05:02.970> sequences<00:05:03.510> in
