show you how you can turn your pc into a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.390 
show you how you can turn your pc into a
Wi-Fi<00:00:06.450> hotspot<00:00:06.710> now<00:00:07.710> first<00:00:08.040> things<00:00:08.220> first

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
Wi-Fi hotspot now first things first

Wi-Fi hotspot now first things first
what<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.670> need<00:00:09.860> for<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.480> connected<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
what you need for that is connected I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.799 
what you need for that is connected I
and<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:14.070> download<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.420> link

and you can download that from the link
given<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.949> I'll<00:00:17.250> even<00:00:17.660> put<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
given here I'll even put that in the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.109 
given here I'll even put that in the
description<00:00:19.470> box<00:00:20.039> below<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.460> once<00:00:20.880> you

download that install it and just simply
run<00:00:25.800> connectify<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:30.560> then<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> first

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
run connectify and then for the first

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
run connectify and then for the first
time<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.690> runs<00:00:33.930> its<00:00:34.350> gonna<00:00:34.700> show<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.480> all

do the same thing for the other two and

do the same thing for the other two and
for<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.129> shearing<00:00:59.520> mode<00:01:00.260> there

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
for this one for the shearing mode there

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.399 
for this one for the shearing mode there
are<00:01:01.350> three<00:01:01.620> options<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.820> instead<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
are three options but instead of the the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.520 
are three options but instead of the the
ones<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:05.010> ad-hoc<00:01:05.250> choose<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.530> Wi-Fi

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ones that say ad-hoc choose the Wi-Fi

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.850 
ones that say ad-hoc choose the Wi-Fi
access<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.549> should<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.860> wpa2

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
access point and that should be wpa2

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.539 
access point and that should be wpa2
encrypted<00:01:12.080> that's<00:01:13.080> also<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
encrypted that's also better than the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.390 
encrypted that's also better than the
WEP<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.630> open<00:01:15.869> encryption<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
WEP or the open encryption because it is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
WEP or the open encryption because it is
the<00:01:17.580> most<00:01:17.610> secure<00:01:17.970> method<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.689> connect<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the most secure method to connect to the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.190 
the most secure method to connect to the
internet<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.460> easily<00:01:20.729> hackable

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
internet and it's not easily hackable

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.710 
internet and it's not easily hackable
unlike<00:01:22.200> WEP<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.130> open<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.509> pretty

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
unlike WEP or open your you're pretty

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
unlike WEP or open your you're pretty
much<00:01:24.780> leaving<00:01:25.110> yourself<00:01:25.320> open<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.430> any

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
much leaving yourself open to any

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
much leaving yourself open to any
attacks<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> anybody<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> neighborhood

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
attacks and anybody in the neighborhood

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.550 
attacks and anybody in the neighborhood
game<00:01:28.650> connect<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.310> internet<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> once

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
game connect to your internet so once

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.060 
game connect to your internet so once
you<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.750> start<00:01:34.439> hotspot<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
you have that you can start hotspot and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.999 
you have that you can start hotspot and
it<00:01:38.070> should<00:01:38.310> take<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.329> few<00:01:39.930> moments<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.350> board<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it should take a few moments to board it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.030 
it should take a few moments to board it
up<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> light<00:01:42.780> version<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
up and now in the light version and I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.030 
up and now in the light version and I
don't<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.570> allows<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> share<00:01:46.979> your

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
don't think it allows you to share your

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.359 
don't think it allows you to share your
files<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> buy<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> full<00:01:49.950> version<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
files but if you buy the full version I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.910 
files but if you buy the full version I
believe<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.880> enables<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
believe it enables you to do so now I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.899 
believe it enables you to do so now I
already<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.229> samsung<00:01:55.229> galaxy<00:01:55.619> s

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
already have my samsung galaxy s

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.080 
already have my samsung galaxy s
connected<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:59.090> my

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
connected to it so I'm going to my

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
connected to it so I'm going to my
connectify<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.930> network<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.100> that's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
connectify me network right now that's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
connectify me network right now that's
what<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.759> show<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.509> wireless

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
what it's gonna show up in your wireless

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.319 
what it's gonna show up in your wireless
device<00:02:04.680> list<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.729> gonna<00:02:05.820> even<00:02:06.090> show

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
device list I think it's gonna even show

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.200 
device list I think it's gonna even show
up<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.910 

so<00:02:10.210> yeah<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.660> can<00:02:10.899> find<00:02:11.170> me<00:02:11.290> no<00:02:11.560> network

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
so yeah see you can find me no network

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.740 
so yeah see you can find me no network
access<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.060> means<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.570> it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
access but that just means that it's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.650 
access but that just means that it's
written<00:02:14.290> properly<00:02:15.990> all<00:02:16.990> right<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:19.000> my

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.140
