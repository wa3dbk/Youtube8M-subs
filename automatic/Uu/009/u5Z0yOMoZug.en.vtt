something down the court like a sprinter
so<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.920> started<00:03:28.220> thinking<00:03:28.489> about<00:03:28.549> attract

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
so I started thinking about attract

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.789 
so I started thinking about attract
strange<00:03:29.350> instead<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.470> traditional

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
strange instead of the traditional

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.460 
strange instead of the traditional
herringbone<00:03:31.459> type<00:03:31.880> zig-zag<00:03:32.750> pattern<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.290> has

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
herringbone type zig-zag pattern it has

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.380 
herringbone type zig-zag pattern it has
little<00:03:33.620> nubs<00:03:33.920> on<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.220> bottom<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> lot

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
little nubs on the bottom and so a lot

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.300 
little nubs on the bottom and so a lot
of<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.630> 100-meter<00:03:36.260> guys<00:03:36.530> were<00:03:36.799> wearing<00:03:37.130> those

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
of the 100-meter guys were wearing those

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.180

real modern technical glasses and the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.000 
real modern technical glasses and the
coating<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.360> on<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.810> lateral<00:03:42.680> piece

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
coating that was on that lateral piece

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.280 
coating that was on that lateral piece
came<00:03:43.370> from<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.150> idea<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.750> Sprinter
