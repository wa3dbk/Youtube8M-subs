00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello friends again I come with a creepy 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 well-known pasta that is titled the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.200
 lost episode of rugrats mom's 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.509
 Carlitos already know everything is taken out of the 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.580
 taringa page good now I continue with 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.410
 Tara believes her and grazes while I will do 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.050
 a tremendous straw by hand changed 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.840
 That's right, bastards, now I 'll tell you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 you think and pasta well runs creepy pasta 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070
 remember with fat animated series of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.899
 babies in nickelodeon what 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 probably do not know is that the creator 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.440
 of the series 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 gabor csupo originally had planned 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 a nocturnal version of rugrats called 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.429
 rascals rock that would happen at night 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.499
 with a more adult humor because 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.269
 all the main channels thought 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.399
 that this adult version was 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.829
 too disturbing refused permission 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 to issue the series and as a result 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.570
 nobody has really heard of such 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.579
 version of the series however a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 station in wellington new zealand by 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.780
 error placed the vhs with the episode of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 the adult version in the morning 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 thinking it was an episode of rugrats 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.620
 regulate the episode that was seen it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.460
 the mother of carlitos called the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.229
 introduction was normal 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.180
 at the end when you shoot me milk 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.729
 on the screen the sound effect is 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.260
 much stronger and the milk just 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.050
 it stays there for about 10 seconds 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.990
 then the name of the episode appears 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.700
 the episode seems normal with children 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 playing in the playground 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.369
 they are all talking about their mothers 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.350
 when carlitos has a vision I was 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.600
 carlitos in the hospital standing next to 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.909
 his mother in bed who was dying 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.430
 of an unknown disease she 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.409
 I was singing you are my sun my only 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.690
 sunlight to carlitos in very weak voice 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.670
 as if I was about to die but 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.429
 when he sang the second verse of the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.289
 song started in reverse a picture of 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.450
 carlitos appeared in front of a footage 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.520
 live action of a toad that is said 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.660
 here it is said that it represents death by 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.729
 the fans 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.009
 carlitos in the turn and screams and when 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.200
 look at his mother his face has a mouth 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.269
 Semi detached as if it were a wound 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 a tear and this one says no 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.470
 worry carlitos it's time for me 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.140
 to keep going with a man's voice 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 very disturbing a random burst of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.980
 action clips are shown say that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.940
 all these clips represent death 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.040
 in one of 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.930
 there is a cow walking in a box 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.790
 with the word kill euros was mind 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.710
 drawn on the face and material of 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.230
 real file of a man suffering the 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.210
 keep being killed you can 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.730
 listen to carlitos screaming all the 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.100
 time a picture of carlitos mom 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.140
 appears again this time with a peak of 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.600
 chicken stuck in the face saying no 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.610
 remember when the whole episode started 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.340
 then start to pass action scenes 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.230
 of mammograms and near delivery 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.020
 after 1 minute of these mammograms 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.570
 you hear mama carlitos say you want your 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.210
 lucky duckling carlitos a fetus 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.370
 dead appears at this moment you see 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.770
 carlitos leave the vision and have a 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.050
 seizure tommy hill and lyle are 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.100
 crying and an ambulance doctor what 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.190
 reassures saying carlitos carlitos 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.470
 can you hear me with stern voice finally 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.050
 after coughing up blood and vomiting 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.120
 carlitos returns to normal then 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.400
 the camera focuses as from the eyes of 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.060
 carlitos and we see tony ching ling the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.010
 doctor 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.410
 ambulances with chicken peaks in their 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.410
 too realistic faces like 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.239
 photographs the scene is cut and appears 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.610
 a picture of a child that looks like 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.770
 carlitos screaming the child is missing the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.130
 arms and legs and look like fresh 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.470
 started after this the credits 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.330
 ordinary followed by 15 minutes of 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.700
 static because the station did not have 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.310
 nothing more to pass surprisingly 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.530
 although the episode was seen by many 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.840
 children just an adult who was watching 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.330
 has spoken of him so far that same 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.950
 year the child suicide rates 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.850
 they went up to the clouds in new 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.200

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.360
 that transmitted that program 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.910
 disappeared shortly after it was 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.980
 past the episode this company had 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.900
 little time to be aired for which 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.690
 its rapid disappearance is understood 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.760
 besides the suicides shortly after the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.250
 hospitals reported a large series of 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.130
 epileptic seizures suffered by children 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.080
 of ages between 5 and 13 years 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.600
 autopsies revealed that before suffering 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.850
 epilepsy the children went into a 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.080
 great nervous breakdown that possibly 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.379
 it was to see scenes 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.300

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.740
 that the episode of the rugrats was 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.469
 extracted by a staff of the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.479
 facilities of that television station in 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.669
