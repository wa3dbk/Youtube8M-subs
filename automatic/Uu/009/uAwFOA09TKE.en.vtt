00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.440
 no no 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.020
 is one more day to my channel today I bring you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 a new video and as you can see the video 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.090
 today is about how I fix my hair 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 when I leave it curl many of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.590
 you told me that you liked 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 much how I had my hair like that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 thank you very much for your 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.030
 comments to truth is that you encourage me to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.550
 Leave my hair curl because I really 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.020
 is that I think it looks better smooth but 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.899
 the truth is that I had a lot of fun 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.579
 so I came up with the idea of 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.829
 explain how I manage to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 I had my hair like that so if you want 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.609
 see how I fix and my hair when I 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.320
 I leave you rite stay to watch the video 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.000
 First, I will show you the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 foams that right now I am using 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.940
 are of these two I do not use them together but 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 what they use is already and other days 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 what use is this would be of the brand 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.040
 schwarzkopf with team neither swing and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.960
 then the degree of skill that they leave 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.970
 the hair of this foam has four 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 degrees and it 's completely 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.060
 is the 3 that would be extra strong the other 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.090
 foam is the george brand and for a curl 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 marked and hardness has five levels 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 and this one would be the 4 that is 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.680
 one after strong both eyebrows more or less 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.260
 the same result used the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.410
 jordi and leave but a little more with 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.210
 volume but I like both bigger 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
 with specifically I'm going to use those from 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.770
 schwarzkopf and now I'm going to teach you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.530
 how I applied it for once and I 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.640
 remove toharia step directly to cast 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.580
 the foam 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 I did not comb it or pull it back 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.130
 but as I had it I leave it to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.640
 down and I start to throw the foam not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.479
 I have with the fact that if he combed it 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 specifically my hair falls apart 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.100
 quite the curl and although after the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.050
 foam is like it does not take the form as 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.290
 you are going to see I am going to throw enough amount 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.030
 of foam do not panic but in my case 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.090
 I have enough hair and for me 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.810
 stay all hair curls all well 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.470
 it's theirs I have to throw a lot 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.780
 we always start the risk of this in 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 scalp and then going down 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.620
 both long and long 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.620
 how to get there 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.340
 another one at the same time that I'm going to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.630
 throwing as you see yes I'm going as 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.630
 half combing with fingers 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.720
 so that the foam also penetrates 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.720
 inside another more 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.390
 save it we can back out 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.819
 because I think he has enough foam 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.569
 I usually do it like this and now 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.569
 we are foam again 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.450
 more or less more quantities and throwing more 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.480
 and I do the same thing today, throwing less 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.319
 like combing lightly 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.319
 another one 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.920
 as I tell you from the scalp 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.790
 elders trying to have product to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.340
 every part of the hair good and more or less 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.130
 it would be no longer a stripe 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.500
 perfect so the floor try 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.840
 center some shapes but as you see 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.180
 this is not a line in the middle or much 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.960
 less then what we already have to take the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.210
 foam in my case I if the weather is nice 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.580
 almost always let it air dry 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.230
 the opposite if they are cold days two are 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 irak here we will feel it with the hair 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.820
 wet but we'll have to dry it 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.260
 I eat enough hair 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.250
 floor volume use the dryer with 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.760
 diffuser but without raising the curl but 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.470
 I apply the diffuser rather of this 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.150
 way I do not 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.880
 and for that I shrink the risk because 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.590
 if I do not have a lot of volume left 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.360
 would like to show us how we are going to see it 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.970
 is that I have just broken the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.920
 this week's speech and I have here the 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.040
 another but more or less is what I say 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 I would do so if you do not sway 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.490
 you can also use the dryer to the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.130
 air force the little to the minimum and what 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.830
 I'm drying from top to bottom always 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.510
 trying not to give much volume to the hair 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.790
 because as I say to you 'I already in itself 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.530
 I have a lot of hair and a lot of volume this 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.170
 specifically, what I do but 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.020
 As I always tell you, it depends a lot on 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.450
 your hair type and well to the people 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 that has a lot less but that does not 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.860
 have volume then the insurance that uses 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.100
 the diffuser to give very good and curl 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.280
 but in my case it is too much and I have left 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.830
 an exaggerated volume because and this has been 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.470
 the video I hope you liked it 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.960
 Do you have any suggestions for 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.570
 to some video in particular leave it to me 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.370
 comments thank you very much for watching me 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.350
 thank you very much with the subscriptions 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.570
 and see you in the next video chau 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.640
 good first of all 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.150
 we discussed how is my skin because I think 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.060
 that when we explain how is some 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.130
 type of cream what we first have to 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.870
 to do is to explain how our skin is and 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.180
 because you already know that creams do not 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.120
 work well for all skin types 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.120
 my skin is mixed is more
