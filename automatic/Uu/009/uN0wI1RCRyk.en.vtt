00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
internet and a lot of talking with

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.089 
internet and a lot of talking with
people<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.750> basically<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> came<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> find

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
people and basically what I came to find

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.529 
people and basically what I came to find
was<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> there's<00:00:26.730> some<00:00:27.029> people<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> were

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
was that there's some people that were

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.009 
was that there's some people that were
having<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.840> problem<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:29.720> what<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.840> did<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
having this problem and what they did to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.299 
having this problem and what they did to
fix<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.500> was<00:00:31.679> install<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> HRC<00:00:32.850> jet<00:00:33.149> kit<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
fix it was install the HRC jet kit and

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.220 
fix it was install the HRC jet kit and
which<00:00:35.309> comes<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.670> HRC<00:00:36.149> kit<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.840> believe

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
which comes with HRC kit which I believe

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.119 
which comes with HRC kit which I believe
is<00:00:37.410> discontinued<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:39.090> anyways<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:40.860> install

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
is discontinued but anyways to install

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
is discontinued but anyways to install
that<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.000> take<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> airbox<00:00:42.600> lid<00:00:42.809> off

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that and then to take the airbox lid off

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
that and then to take the airbox lid off
and<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:47.120> basically<00:00:48.120> started<00:00:48.690> talking

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and so I basically started talking

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
and so I basically started talking
around<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> throwing<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
around with people and throwing that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.470 
around with people and throwing that
idea<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:53.030> people<00:00:54.030> seem<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
idea around and people seem to like it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.680 
idea around and people seem to like it
and<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.410> sounded<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> would<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.340> sense

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
and it sounded like it would make sense

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.040 
and it sounded like it would make sense
so<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.109> went<00:00:58.320> ahead<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.750> tested<00:01:00.750> some

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so we went ahead and I tested some

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.429 
so we went ahead and I tested some
things<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:03.090> went<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> dealership

which<00:01:15.150> bumps<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> main<00:01:15.930> jet<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.500> 120<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
which bumps up the main jet from 120 and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.499 
which bumps up the main jet from 120 and
the<00:01:17.520> leak<00:01:17.700> jet<00:01:17.939> gets<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.930> bump<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.560> 55<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the leak jet gets a bump down to 55 and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
the leak jet gets a bump down to 55 and
I<00:01:22.200> didn't<00:01:22.439> take<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> airbox<00:01:22.890> lid<00:01:23.070> off<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.700> tried

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I didn't take the airbox lid off I tried

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700 
I didn't take the airbox lid off I tried
it<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.930> didn't<00:01:25.140> seem<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> work<00:01:25.530> as

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it with and it didn't seem to work as

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
it with and it didn't seem to work as
well<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.729> seems<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.150> jetted<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.750> right

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
well it seems to be jetted just right

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.679 
well it seems to be jetted just right
for<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.310> by<00:01:29.790> doing<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.180> two<00:01:30.360> things<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
for this so by doing those two things it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
for this so by doing those two things it
seems<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> eliminate<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> bog<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.850> also

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
seems to eliminate the bog and it also

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
seems to eliminate the bog and it also
sounds<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> common<00:01:34.409> problem<00:01:34.829> for

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sounds like this is a common problem for

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
sounds like this is a common problem for
my<00:01:35.670> dealership<00:01:36.110> they've<00:01:37.110> done<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.500> couple

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
my dealership they've done this a couple

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
my dealership they've done this a couple
times<00:01:37.740> helping<00:01:38.340> people<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:39.090> their<00:01:39.299> TRX

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
times helping people out with their TRX

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.990 
times helping people out with their TRX
or<00:01:40.380> 50<00:01:40.650> RS<00:01:40.799> os6<00:01:41.369> map<00:01:41.810> with<00:01:42.810> jetting<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:44.369> will

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
or 50 RS os6 map with jetting so I will

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.289 
or 50 RS os6 map with jetting so I will
show<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> bog<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.619> completely

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
show you that the bog is completely

00:01:47.299 --> 00:02:11.119 
show you that the bog is completely
eliminated

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.869 

so<00:02:12.129> there<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.489> go

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
so there you go

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.679 
so there you go
Boggs<00:02:13.239> all<00:02:13.540> gone<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.879> anyone<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.510> having

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
Boggs all gone and if anyone is having

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.910 
Boggs all gone and if anyone is having
this<00:02:16.930> problem<00:02:18.030> again<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.299> 55<00:02:20.200> leak<00:02:20.709> jet

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
this problem again this is a 55 leak jet

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.030 
this problem again this is a 55 leak jet
and<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.670> 162<00:02:22.329> main<00:02:22.569> jet<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.319> should<00:02:23.620> tear

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
and a 162 main jet and that should tear

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.569 
and a 162 main jet and that should tear
it<00:02:24.099> right<00:02:24.129> up<00:02:25.200> I'm<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.379> pretty<00:02:26.709> low<00:02:26.980> elevation
