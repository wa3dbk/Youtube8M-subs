clear and if you're outside you can

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170 
clear and if you're outside you can
still<00:02:32.910> adjust<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.640> will<00:02:35.730> even<00:02:35.850> be

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
still adjust it so that it will even be

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.590 
still adjust it so that it will even be
brighter<00:02:36.860> let's<00:02:37.860> go<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.310> brightness<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
brighter let's go to the brightness and

can set it to five and it's even

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.020 
can set it to five and it's even
brighter<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.920> let's<00:02:44.100> not<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.459> let's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
brighter but let's not do that let's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.870 
brighter but let's not do that let's
just<00:02:45.239> get<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.790> even<00:02:47.790> though

just get out of there and even though

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.570 
just get out of there and even though
it's<00:02:48.060> small<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:49.380> actually<00:02:49.590> very<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:50.340> easy

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
it's small it's actually very very easy

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's small it's actually very very easy
to<00:02:51.269> enter<00:02:51.660> numbers<00:02:52.290> or<00:02:52.650> text<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.319> even<00:02:55.319> though

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920 
me to do one thing though that I find a
bit<00:03:04.890> annoying<00:03:05.160> about<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.819> cellphone<00:03:06.720> is

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
bit annoying about this cellphone is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.800 
bit annoying about this cellphone is
that<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.519> there's<00:03:08.970> no<00:03:09.209> label<00:03:09.660> on

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that as you can see there's no label on

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.390 
that as you can see there's no label on
the<00:03:10.590> icons<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.790> menu<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:13.500> icon<00:03:14.220> would

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the icons for the menu the icon would

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.690 
the icons for the menu the icon would
only<00:03:14.640> enlarge<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.600> bit<00:03:16.310> whenever<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.489> select

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
only enlarge a bit whenever you select

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.490 
only enlarge a bit whenever you select
it<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:20.340> there's<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.760> label<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.390> top<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
it and then there's a label on top and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.199 
it and then there's a label on top and
sometimes<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.519> very<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.000> confusing<00:03:26.209> to

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
sometimes it's very very confusing to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.650 
sometimes it's very very confusing to
know<00:03:27.329> which<00:03:27.540> icon<00:03:28.109> was<00:03:28.859> selected<00:03:29.730> another

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
know which icon was selected another

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.490 
know which icon was selected another
thing<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:31.890> example<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.579> go<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
thing is that when for example I go to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.220 
thing is that when for example I go to
the<00:03:34.620> text<00:03:34.950> editor<00:03:35.730> when<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> want<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.569> send<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the text editor when I want to send the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.660 
the text editor when I want to send the
text<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:38.579> write<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:39.139> soft<00:03:40.139> key<00:03:40.579> instead<00:03:41.579> of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
text there write a soft key instead of

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.690 
text there write a soft key instead of
becoming<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.480> back<00:03:42.750> key<00:03:44.359> becomes<00:03:45.359> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
becoming the back key becomes this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.030 
becoming the back key becomes this
selector<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:47.970> either<00:03:48.380> standard<00:03:49.380> multi-tap

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
selector for either standard multi-tap

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
selector for either standard multi-tap
or<00:03:50.250> t9<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.720> when<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.019> first<00:03:52.260> got<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.889> was

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
or t9 so when I first got this I was

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.449 
or t9 so when I first got this I was
like<00:03:53.190> typing<00:03:53.639> something<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:55.130> then<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.250> thought

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
like typing something and then I thought

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.319 
like typing something and then I thought
this<00:03:56.579> was<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> back<00:03:57.120> key<00:03:57.480> when<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.200> click

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
this was the back key when I click

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.569 
this was the back key when I click
pressed<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:01.079> turned<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.859> from<00:04:01.889> multi-tap

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
pressed it it turned it from multi-tap

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.890 
pressed it it turned it from multi-tap
to<00:04:02.730> t9<00:04:03.150> or<00:04:03.569> numbers<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.560> them<00:04:04.950> symbols<00:04:05.900> there

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
to t9 or numbers or them symbols there

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.059 
to t9 or numbers or them symbols there
is<00:04:07.109> no<00:04:07.519> back<00:04:08.519> key<00:04:09.000> shortcut<00:04:09.900> because<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:10.799> one

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is no back key shortcut because this one

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.570 
is no back key shortcut because this one
the<00:04:11.700> end<00:04:11.879> call<00:04:12.269> turns<00:04:12.930> into<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:14.099> sort<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.400> like
