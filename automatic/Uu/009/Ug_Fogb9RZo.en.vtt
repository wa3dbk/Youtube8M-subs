00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.929

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.420
 Well, friends, I want to show today 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 I'll tell you honestly there is such a problem on 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.260
 rivers and quiet and sometime rush any 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 what freight is not usually abandoned cargo 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 down the stream washes away but one is greater than 1 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 the smaller leg of course you invited 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.719
 last example master 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.980
 than she straight from that she of course 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.450
 tell the shore and it turns out wrong 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 eyebolts anywhere-nowhere just 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 throw wrong wrong feed 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 put down 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 where someone hooked confused 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 From all swears you are unhappy or else 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 somewhere tip for now but i'm long 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 On this subject I thought I thought Aiden cooler 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.579
 came up with say today his want you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.590
 show and of course someone will come in handy 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.100
 button to use tailor 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 try and see for yourself 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.710
 moisten what is the essence 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.119
 is that I put the load on 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.990
 yokes here such a flock ship 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.080
 previous films already showed here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 if such a yoke which is 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.729
 directly cheese cover moist such 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.830
 Here are complex rockers very pebbles 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.900
 comfortable durable plastic I don't know who them 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.320
 makes no advertising 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.119
 I donâ€™t even want to know who 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 producer in general is now 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.579
 tell focus on top they are transparent 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.470
 water is very comfortable fish for even if 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.299
 checked 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.909
 well they can be used everywhere 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.119
 Marina retreat 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.480
 the mass in the storage does not work 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 wonderfully rust and 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.850
 no visible office break 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.660
 that is, no matter how you twisted 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.430
 arrivals will not turn well and this one except 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 gather is that I have all 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.100
 see for yourself the truth as an example 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.450
 what is your ass of me what about there not 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.800
 turned out thick 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:20.070
 I do not get this in general I'm here 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.260
 such swivel friend insert the wire 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.140
 Georgia you can of course shine 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.180
 tether can use wire 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.450
 how using can be what clip 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.970
 like fishermen who catch carp and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.490
 enjoy such a clip when so he 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 was able to get rid of us remained whole 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:44.670
 and cling to the wire 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.470
 Here too I am certainly not a panacea 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.440
 the same it will cling to the fact that in 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.990
 I want to show how it should be here 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.530
 So the question I have for spring 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.690
 I throw with two cargo never 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 accordingly it has more turns 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 the range where it lies spring and although not 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.840
 only hold if it pulls it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 stick to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.860
 somewhere some kind of reed about me 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.500
 as far as right away 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.840
 music tackle does not go away one thing when 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.030
 one load of his demolition reading he leaves 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.370
 and another movie when two eyes 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.300
 certainly not a strong kidnapping 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.350
 put on 2 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.400
 more more well let's say the same 150 or 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.080
 160 grams . 80 can and put here 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.870
 so the tackle will surely go here 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.239
 this way you will have to lie on 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.100
 the area u will occupy more space 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.830
 cargo and and accordingly not so be 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.640
 drag may even need to put 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:46.680
 as i said on blessings and increases 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.230
 situation when the load is taken 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.080
 I recommend such a try tackle on 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.270
 rocker on casting noble on centuries not 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 I know I really liked it so I will 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.000
 enjoy in his pressing sharing 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.160
 someone useful while high with you 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.330
 was today the rector of the box so on 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.330
 fishing at the next meetings
