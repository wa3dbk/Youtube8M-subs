00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.490
 after 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.490
 after 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.359
 it's been ten years since the design office in the sense of working on the city and 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 high speed railcar 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.560
 in 2003 when the company is in big trouble it takes up the challenge 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.120
 by launching this program entirely financed from own funds 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 without the support of the SNCF as it was the case for the tgv 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.500
 remains the worthy heiress of the fast train with which she has already 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 had the opportunity to flirt 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.850
 that day the tgv sprays the world record of speed on rail 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.200
 the party 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.700
 to achieve this performance the builder had the idea of ​​equipping a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.610
 experimental train car 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.120
 of a beautiful I am revolutionary the technique at the very base of five 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.180
 new self-propelled trains 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.690
 an electric motor and placed on each axle a conclusive test for 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.180
 the Algeria 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.840
 the lgv project is a brand new project had never rolled 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.650
 when the young man died Thursday in los angeles at 300 francs 150 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.510
 from the outset 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.260
 to drive it at 1,550 kilometers an hour 200 kilometers north of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.490
 goma in play it's still but he adds 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 reliability quality safety of course 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.110
 so more locomotive at each end 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.960
 but a motorization distributed on each candle all along the train 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.460
 with this system the power included 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.920
 a commercial speed of 360 kilometers an hour 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.259
 while achieving 20% ​​energy savings 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.050
 with the help of its first driver alstom intends to sell the jv in the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.440
 italy has just ordered 25 oars which worries us the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.060
 operate at 300 kilometers hour only profile picture of wood 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 suitable for higher speeds 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.309
 but the fact of walking to take away remains that of the renewal of 300 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.109
