00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850 

what<00:00:21.160> is<00:00:21.580> it<00:00:22.200> that's<00:00:23.200> a<00:00:23.320> question<00:00:23.440> you<00:00:23.680> hear<00:00:23.830> a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
what is it that's a question you hear a

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.590 
what is it that's a question you hear a
lot<00:00:24.010> when<00:00:24.190> you<00:00:24.280> ride<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.700> new<00:00:24.850> electro<00:00:25.420> bike

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
lot when you ride the new electro bike

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.340 
lot when you ride the new electro bike
it's<00:00:26.200> called<00:00:26.470> pi<00:00:27.040> that<00:00:27.670> spelled<00:00:27.970> TI<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:29.170> it's

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
it's called pi that spelled TI and it's

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.740 
it's called pi that spelled TI and it's
made<00:00:29.560> by<00:00:29.830> electrolyte<00:00:30.670> we're<00:00:31.420> standing<00:00:31.570> here

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
made by electrolyte we're standing here

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.479 
made by electrolyte we're standing here
by<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.050> Golden<00:00:32.410> Gate<00:00:32.559> Bridge<00:00:32.590> which<00:00:33.129> is<00:00:33.280> in

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
by the Golden Gate Bridge which is in

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.279 
by the Golden Gate Bridge which is in
San<00:00:33.760> Francisco<00:00:33.940> which<00:00:34.449> is<00:00:34.600> where<00:00:34.809> electro

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
San Francisco which is where electro

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.439 
San Francisco which is where electro
bike<00:00:35.559> is<00:00:35.769> based<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:36.999> think<00:00:37.059> it's<00:00:37.269> a<00:00:37.329> pretty

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
bike is based and I think it's a pretty

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.899 
bike is based and I think it's a pretty
apt<00:00:37.690> metaphor<00:00:37.929> because<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:38.859> bikes<00:00:39.399> shape

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
apt metaphor because of this bikes shape

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.110 
apt metaphor because of this bikes shape
and<00:00:40.179> also<00:00:40.480> what<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.659> bike<00:00:40.899> is<00:00:41.170> designed<00:00:41.679> to<00:00:41.859> do

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and also what the bike is designed to do

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.349 
and also what the bike is designed to do
it<00:00:43.120> combines<00:00:43.570> human<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:44.620> electric<00:00:45.249> power<00:00:45.460> the

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
it combines human and electric power the

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.329 
it combines human and electric power the
environmental<00:00:46.929> footprint<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.679> part<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.190> that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
environmental footprint is part of that

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.569 
environmental footprint is part of that
equation<00:00:48.579> traditional<00:00:49.569> bicycle<00:00:50.050> travel<00:00:50.579> for

equation traditional bicycle travel for

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.700 
equation traditional bicycle travel for
work<00:00:51.609> commuting<00:00:52.239> purposes<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.079> little<00:00:53.499> slow

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
work commuting purposes is a little slow

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.340 
work commuting purposes is a little slow
and<00:00:53.999> car<00:00:54.999> commuting<00:00:55.420> purposes<00:00:55.899> as<00:00:56.050> we<00:00:56.199> know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
and car commuting purposes as we know

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.590 
and car commuting purposes as we know
also<00:00:56.769> can<00:00:57.399> be<00:00:57.429> a<00:00:57.550> little<00:00:57.699> slow<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.539> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
also can be a little slow so the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.149 
also can be a little slow so the
electric<00:00:58.960> bike<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.379> wonderful<00:00:59.800> because<00:00:59.920> you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
electric bike is wonderful because you

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.099 
electric bike is wonderful because you
can<00:01:00.280> actually<00:01:00.339> get<00:01:00.729> places<00:01:01.059> almost<00:01:01.780> as<00:01:01.899> fast

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
can actually get places almost as fast

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.959 
can actually get places almost as fast
as<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.350> would<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.679> car<00:01:02.889> but<00:01:03.489> certainly<00:01:03.789> get

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
as you would in a car but certainly get

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.060 
as you would in a car but certainly get
there<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.330> lot<00:01:04.540> faster<00:01:04.600> than<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.409> would<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.979> a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
there a lot faster than you would on a

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.429 
there a lot faster than you would on a
traditional<00:01:06.759> bicycle<00:01:07.329> what's<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.930> precise

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
traditional bicycle what's the precise

work<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.369> very<00:01:24.579> unique<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.969> this<00:01:25.030> vehicle
