so<00:00:01.100> we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> make<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> little

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so we're going to make a little

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.999 
so we're going to make a little
comparison<00:00:03.000> here<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> full<00:00:04.020> HD<00:00:04.350> screen<00:00:04.380> asus

QE<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:12.420> first<00:00:12.690> thing<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.870> noticed<00:00:13.259> when

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
QE and the first thing I noticed when

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
QE and the first thing I noticed when
using<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.040> enormous<00:00:14.490> resolution<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.509> how

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
using this enormous resolution was how

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.310 
using this enormous resolution was how
much<00:00:15.990> space<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.859> actually<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.730> desktop

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
much space I actually have on my desktop

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
much space I actually have on my desktop
and<00:00:19.460> over<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.970> fit<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.570> bit

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and over here I can fit a little bit

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.700 
and over here I can fit a little bit
over<00:00:22.020> 1000<00:00:22.890> shortcuts<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.560> hopefully<00:00:25.560> this

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
over 1000 shortcuts and hopefully this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.259 
over 1000 shortcuts and hopefully this
would<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.220> than<00:00:26.340> enough<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.939> most<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
would be more than enough for most of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
would be more than enough for most of
you<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.019> trying<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> look<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.920> find

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you and if you're trying to look or find

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
you and if you're trying to look or find
something<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.820> specific<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.080> will

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
something in specific here it will

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.250 
something in specific here it will
actually<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:32.009> quite<00:00:32.250> hard<00:00:33.110> looking<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
actually be quite hard looking at the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
actually be quite hard looking at the
browser<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.160> browsing<00:00:36.120> into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> verge

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
browser here I'm browsing into the verge

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
browser here I'm browsing into the verge
and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.219> basically<00:00:38.910> all

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and I can see that have basically all

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
and I can see that have basically all
the<00:00:39.510> top<00:00:39.719> news<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.340> screen<00:00:41.579> without<00:00:41.790> having

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the top news on my screen without having

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
the top news on my screen without having
to<00:00:42.270> scroll<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.110> actually<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> feels

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to scroll down and actually that feels

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.240 
to scroll down and actually that feels
quite<00:00:44.850> nice<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.770> even<00:00:46.950> more<00:00:46.980> interesting

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
quite nice what is even more interesting

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.720 
quite nice what is even more interesting
to<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.870> compare<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.070> window<00:00:50.489> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to see is if we compare the window that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.360 
to see is if we compare the window that
we<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> browser<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> 4k

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we have here in the browser on the 4k

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
we have here in the browser on the 4k
monitor<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> dragging<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> full

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
monitor and dragging this over to a full

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
monitor and dragging this over to a full
HD<00:00:56.010> screen<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> while<00:00:58.379> only

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
HD screen you can see that while only

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
HD screen you can see that while only
taking<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.609> fraction<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> screen<00:01:00.480> here

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
taking up a fraction of the screen here

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.740 
taking up a fraction of the screen here
on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> 4k<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:02.070> take<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.940> almost<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on the 4k it will take up almost all of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.250 
on the 4k it will take up almost all of
the<00:01:04.110> space<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> full<00:01:04.949> HD<00:01:05.189> screen<00:01:05.400> monitor

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
the space on the full HD screen monitor

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
the space on the full HD screen monitor
so<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.680> enormous<00:01:07.950> difference<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.670> how

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
so it's an enormous difference in how

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.399 
so it's an enormous difference in how
much<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.630> use<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.320> your

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
much you can actually use on your

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.120 
much you can actually use on your
desktop<00:01:11.900> another<00:01:12.900> interesting<00:01:13.409> aspect<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
desktop another interesting aspect I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
desktop another interesting aspect I
think<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.610> lot<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> people<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.210> interesting<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
think a lot of people are interesting in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
think a lot of people are interesting in
is<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.259> how<00:01:16.439> well<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> performs<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.670> games

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
is to see how well it performs in games

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
is to see how well it performs in games
and<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.409> required<00:01:19.650> from

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and actually how much is required from

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.249 
and actually how much is required from
your<00:01:20.220> hardware<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> computer<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.080> using

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
your hardware the computer we're using

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.130 
your hardware the computer we're using
here<00:01:22.590> uses<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> gtx<00:01:23.430> 680<00:01:23.909> graphics<00:01:24.509> card<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.990> 2

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
here uses a gtx 680 graphics card with 2

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.460 
here uses a gtx 680 graphics card with 2
gigabytes<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> vram<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> while<00:01:27.869> starting<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
gigabytes of vram so while starting the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.749 
gigabytes of vram so while starting the
game<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.250> using<00:01:29.570> medium<00:01:31.579> settings<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
game here I'm using medium settings in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.810 
game here I'm using medium settings in
battlefield<00:01:33.150> 3<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.130> well<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.400> course<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
battlefield 3 and well of course it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.020 
battlefield 3 and well of course it
looks<00:01:35.990> really<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.220> details<00:01:38.640> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
looks really really good the details is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.679 
looks really really good the details is
quite<00:01:39.570> amazing<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.820> while<00:01:41.820> playing<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.390> does

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
quite amazing and while playing it does

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.950 
quite amazing and while playing it does
actually<00:01:43.229> run<00:01:43.770> quite<00:01:44.100> smoothly<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
actually run quite smoothly and we get a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.319 
actually run quite smoothly and we get a
little<00:01:46.470> over<00:01:46.649> 50<00:01:47.220> frames<00:01:47.399> per<00:01:47.670> second<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
little over 50 frames per second here

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.139 
little over 50 frames per second here
while<00:01:49.290> playing<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.100> course<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.670> using

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
while playing and of course it's using

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.160 
while playing and of course it's using
the<00:01:51.270> 4k<00:01:51.860> resolution

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
the 4k resolution

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.390 
the 4k resolution
if<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.410> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.800> play<00:01:56.010> in<00:01:56.070> higher

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
if you're going to play in higher

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.400 
if you're going to play in higher
details<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.870> instance<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.230> wouldn't

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
details like for instance you wouldn't

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.410 
details like for instance you wouldn't
want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> play<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:58.980> ultra<00:01:59.490> then<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.150> will

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
want to play with ultra then you will

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990 
want to play with ultra then you will

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
most likely need a little bit more vram

most likely need a little bit more vram
than<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.510> GTX<00:02:03.690> 680<00:02:04.500> features<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> would

recommend<00:02:06.180> maybe<00:02:06.720> free<00:02:07.140> gigabytes<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.130> more

recommend maybe free gigabytes or more

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.640
