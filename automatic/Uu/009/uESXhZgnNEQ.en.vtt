cuz of colors now this right here is a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.240 
cuz of colors now this right here is a
female<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.849> look<00:02:49.120> at<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.379> face<00:02:50.620> the

aren't<00:02:53.170> out<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:54.760> think<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
aren't out now this I think is a more

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.559 
aren't out now this I think is a more
dominant<00:02:56.920> female<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.670> she<00:02:57.730> has<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> bit<00:02:58.540> more

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
dominant female so she has a bit more

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.930 
dominant female so she has a bit more
color<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.140> an<00:02:59.290> average<00:02:59.470> female<00:02:59.859> but<00:03:00.700> still

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
color and an average female but still

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.729 
color and an average female but still
just<00:03:01.180> look<00:03:01.420> at<00:03:01.510> those<00:03:01.629> amazing<00:03:01.780> colors<00:03:02.439> now<00:03:02.709> I

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
just look at those amazing colors now I

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.229 
just look at those amazing colors now I
wish<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.099> could<00:03:03.280> show<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.459> guys<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.879> middle

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
but I don't want to reveal that tank

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.940 
but I don't want to reveal that tank
because<00:03:06.489> at<00:03:06.730> he's<00:03:07.239> only<00:03:07.450> 2<00:03:07.780> inches<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.799> his

colors<00:03:09.340> are<00:03:09.489> even<00:03:09.700> better<00:03:09.879> so<00:03:10.629> these<00:03:10.780> fish<00:03:11.079> are

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319

so<00:03:15.579> this<00:03:16.329> fish<00:03:16.599> is<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.989> only<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.760> beautiful

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
so this fish is not only a beautiful

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.330 
so this fish is not only a beautiful
fish<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.209> not<00:03:19.510> only<00:03:19.720> has<00:03:19.989> amazing<00:03:20.709> personality

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
fish it not only has amazing personality

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.849 
fish it not only has amazing personality
but<00:03:21.909> in<00:03:22.060> my<00:03:22.209> opinion<00:03:22.329> it's<00:03:22.870> also<00:03:23.049> easy<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.620> take

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
but in my opinion it's also easy to take

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.559 
but in my opinion it's also easy to take
care<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.129> so<00:03:24.430> what<00:03:24.609> else<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.060> ask<00:03:25.150> for

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
care of so what else could you ask for

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.960 
care of so what else could you ask for
now<00:03:26.139> these<00:03:26.379> fish<00:03:26.739> don't<00:03:27.069> get<00:03:27.250> too<00:03:27.400> big<00:03:27.609> which<00:03:27.849> I

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
now these fish don't get too big which I

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.210 
now these fish don't get too big which I
love<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.480> get<00:03:28.629> around<00:03:28.959> maybe<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.980> male's

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
love to get around maybe the male's

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.800 
love to get around maybe the male's
might<00:03:30.579> reach<00:03:30.790> 10<00:03:31.090> inches<00:03:31.359> but<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.629> average

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
might reach 10 inches but the average

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.199 
might reach 10 inches but the average
size<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.409> 8<00:03:32.620> inches<00:03:33.069> so<00:03:33.639> you<00:03:33.670> don't<00:03:33.909> have<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
size is 8 inches so you don't have to

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.119 
size is 8 inches so you don't have to
worry<00:03:34.389> about<00:03:34.450> -<00:03:34.720> they're<00:03:34.840> not<00:03:34.959> gigantic<00:03:35.680> tank

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
worry about - they're not gigantic tank

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.189 
worry about - they're not gigantic tank
maybe<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.579> 75<00:03:37.150> will<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.449> green<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:37.750> these<00:03:37.959> guys

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
maybe a 75 will be green for these guys

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.460 
maybe a 75 will be green for these guys
because<00:03:39.099> they<00:03:39.280> don't<00:03:39.459> get<00:03:39.669> too<00:03:39.870> huge<00:03:40.870> so

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
because they don't get too huge so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.439 
because they don't get too huge so
that's<00:03:41.680> another<00:03:41.889> plus<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.430> care<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.180> pretty
