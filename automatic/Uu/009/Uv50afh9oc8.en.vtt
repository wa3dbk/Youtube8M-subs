00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.370
 I am MatÃ­as and in the fourth part of my tutor and palmar the rubik cube 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.749
 p 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:10.789
 every part of the world 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.709
 we will see how to do step three which is to put the corners of the first stage 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.880
 so try the first two layers of our work today 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.720
 at 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.859
 we will start with 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.099
 the one that the case one and two 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.300
 as in some of the cast 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 the composite color is yellow as 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.160
 as we already know 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.280
 we start looking for the corners if they do not have yellow for example high 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 that has red green i 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.789
 then we arrive at Tahrir Square 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.840
 this in your wish 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.200
 we still have red green and white 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.170
 as you can see 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.670
 in this tense I have the lacko to my left and is looking 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.780
 Likewise 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 and is that yes case 1 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.530
 equate resolves what we play the following algorithms 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.350
 fencing 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.950
 1 l 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.970
 United 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 l bonus 1 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 i with this the extinguished 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 in your position 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510
 the case is that they are made 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.150
 we have to climb naranjo 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 5 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.000
 and how can they see the case is similar 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.620
 to the case one only the white arrives the sixth looking but it will be our 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.240
 right 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.720
 to solve this we will play that the next 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.260
 algorithm 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.780
 a bonus 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.190
 that represses 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.240
 Her cousin 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.579

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.320

 r a bonus 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.980
 it is repressed 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.860
 itunes party resolved 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.660
 now we will see case 3 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.140
 that is when the white color is looking up as you can see 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.949
 I have the suite I have the 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.649
 red but it does not matter up 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.559
 after solving this we will occupy the following 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.959
 at least 10 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.339
 that very 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:24.529
 r a premium ferry a premium and we do this once again r unger repress your premium 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.029
 a final recovery session 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.369
 the case 4 st 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.369
 when the corner is in place 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.079
 Orange tree 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079

 empty door yes 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.029
 percent like venus sixth watching and is our 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.529
 right issste solves with the following algorithms 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.109
 r a primate represses 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.259

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.319

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.759
 percent and almost five 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.910
 when the rats 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 pig this orange bet 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.319
 the forward will be on tour 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.559
 for Andres one of the ensembles like the musel are always 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.049

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 l prima 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.709
 you do not know is already 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.049
 resolved 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.969
 kylie other cases quito and cuenca are for example art 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.319
 when the war corner this bet but this one in another club 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.999
 for then what then simply put the both 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.179
 cards to any corner 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.799
 with the case or more 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:51.709
 percent 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.229
 I recommend taking the case number 3 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.819
 quesque rebound represses prima 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 3 pesos 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.019
 and with this 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.149
 then later 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.629
 we look for its position that is because it hits red green and white 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 according to cely algorithm we already know 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.920
 good this is 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.150
 other cases that hide the kina are put but it is wrong 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:25.300
 as you can see 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.220
 This is 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.559
 financial crisis here therefore we can 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:30.849
 with the state 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.069
 i automatically goes jack and teresa 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.069
 if we play the malaria that we already know 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 we prioritize that hopefully it did not stay there 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.670
 6% and we put it 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.750
 I'm here 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.219
 case 2 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.550
 and trust 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.949
 we made the first two houses 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.949
 notimex -pekin and let's see 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.699
 another way to be the case 3 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.539
 percent 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.900
 we make it work in your profile 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.529
 r a primate represses Cuba 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.079
 rq premiums are repressed r raw etc 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.099
 well this concludes this part of 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.969
 in the global computation 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.969
 in the next part they understand how to be 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.879
 so good on efe on twitter
