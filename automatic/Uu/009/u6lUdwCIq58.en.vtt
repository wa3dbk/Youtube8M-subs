most epoxies one day hardened you know

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.260 
most epoxies one day hardened you know
they<00:03:18.640> they<00:03:19.000> harden<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.550> not<00:03:22.210> like

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
they they harden it's not like not like

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.980 
they they harden it's not like not like
silicone<00:03:22.990> or<00:03:23.290> anything<00:03:23.590> like<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.780> was

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
silicone or anything like that this was

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.070 
silicone or anything like that this was
probably<00:03:26.370> successful<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.850> high<00:03:28.000> key<00:03:28.260> also

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
probably successful in a high key also

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.370 
probably successful in a high key also
yeah<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.350> take<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.250> top<00:03:33.520> of<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.170> ford<00:03:35.170> motor

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
yeah I take the top of the ford motor

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.820 
yeah I take the top of the ford motor
filter<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.510> compare<00:03:37.960> it<00:03:38.020> with<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.230> Pennzoil

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
filter and compare it with the Pennzoil

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.060 
filter and compare it with the Pennzoil
it's<00:03:39.310> all<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.300> same<00:03:40.600> except<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.170> these<00:03:41.500> holes

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
it's all the same except for these holes

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's all the same except for these holes
here<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:44.470> Ford's<00:03:44.920> filters<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:48.490> I<00:03:48.640> didn't

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
here on Ford's filters and I didn't

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.150 
here on Ford's filters and I didn't
mention<00:03:49.090> them<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> motor<00:03:50.140> craft<00:03:50.560> video

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
mention them in the motor craft video

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.460 
mention them in the motor craft video
but<00:03:51.520> inside<00:03:51.970> here<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> spring<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:56.380> valve

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
but inside here is a spring and a valve

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.070 
but inside here is a spring and a valve
so<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.650> does<00:03:59.890> have<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.160> bypass<00:04:01.080> bypass

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
so this does have the bypass bypass

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.600 
so this does have the bypass bypass
valve<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.830> also

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
valve on it also

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.720 
valve on it also
this<00:04:06.240> builder<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:10.190> I'm<00:04:11.190> sorry<00:04:11.460> I<00:04:11.520> can't

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
this builder and I'm sorry I can't

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.819 
this builder and I'm sorry I can't
remember<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.150> others<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.230> frame<00:04:15.829> but

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
remember the others the the frame but

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.710 
remember the others the the frame but
this<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.420> you<00:04:18.420> know<00:04:20.090> there's<00:04:21.090> small

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
this is you know there's small

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.810 
this is you know there's small
differences<00:04:22.320> but<00:04:22.710> seem<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.370> be<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> lot<00:04:23.790> of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
differences but seem to be a lot of

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.850 
differences but seem to be a lot of
pleats

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
pleats

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.280 
pleats
it's<00:04:25.860> joined<00:04:26.130> together<00:04:26.280> right<00:04:26.760> here

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.720 

hopefully<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.560> see<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:34.730> silver

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
hopefully you can see that silver

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.750 
hopefully you can see that silver
material<00:04:36.390> really<00:04:36.600> isn't<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.830> it's<00:04:38.220> not<00:04:38.400> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
material really isn't it's it's not that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.290 
material really isn't it's it's not that
hasn't<00:04:38.910> separated<00:04:39.660> from<00:04:40.370> from<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.520> epoxy<00:04:42.090> but

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
hasn't separated from from the epoxy but

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.740 
hasn't separated from from the epoxy but
you<00:04:43.020> know<00:04:43.200> separated<00:04:44.100> from<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.340> bottom<00:04:44.750> it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
you know separated from the bottom it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.330 
you know separated from the bottom it
has<00:04:45.780> made<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.080> mountain<00:04:46.500> but<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:46.740> separated

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
has made a mountain but it's separated

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.080 
has made a mountain but it's separated
so<00:04:48.210> I'm<00:04:48.300> questioning<00:04:48.600> his<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.290> say<00:04:49.500> uh<00:04:50.090> you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
so I'm questioning his to say uh you

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.060 
so I'm questioning his to say uh you
know<00:04:51.710> manufacturing<00:04:53.330> defect<00:04:54.500> or<00:04:55.500> was<00:04:55.950> this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
know manufacturing defect or was this

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.900 
know manufacturing defect or was this
under<00:04:56.400> extremely<00:04:56.790> harsh<00:04:57.150> conditions<00:04:57.870> but

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
under extremely harsh conditions but

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.270 
under extremely harsh conditions but
correct<00:04:59.910> me<00:05:00.030> if<00:05:00.150> I'm<00:05:00.330> wrong<00:05:00.360> if<00:05:01.070> something<00:05:02.070> is

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
correct me if I'm wrong if something is

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.159 
correct me if I'm wrong if something is
X<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.970> know<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.090> mean<00:05:03.360> these<00:05:03.480> are<00:05:03.690> designed<00:05:04.050> to

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
X you know I mean these are designed to

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.930 
X you know I mean these are designed to
be<00:05:04.290> on<00:05:04.410> vehicles<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.160> operate<00:05:05.610> under<00:05:05.910> a

be on vehicles and operate under a
variety<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.570> different<00:05:08.060> driving<00:05:09.060> conditions

variety of different driving conditions
should<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.880> filter<00:05:12.270> not<00:05:12.479> hold<00:05:12.780> up<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:14.070> could

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
should a filter not hold up that could

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.350 
should a filter not hold up that could
be<00:05:14.370> wrong<00:05:16.850> but<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:17.910> madellaine<00:05:18.479> cap<00:05:18.750> pleaded

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
be wrong but that madellaine cap pleaded

be wrong but that madellaine cap pleaded
I'm<00:05:22.259> not<00:05:22.379> bad<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:25.110> only<00:05:25.259> thing<00:05:25.500> it's

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
I'm not bad the only thing it's

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.260 
I'm not bad the only thing it's
disturbing<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.669> fact<00:05:26.909> that<00:05:27.000> these

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
disturbing is the fact that these

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.990 
disturbing is the fact that these
endcaps<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.349> come<00:05:28.530> apart

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.230 

that's<00:05:36.450> pretty<00:05:36.660> much<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:37.970> seems<00:05:38.970> like<00:05:39.210> a

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
that's pretty much it seems like a

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.020 
that's pretty much it seems like a
decent<00:05:39.480> filter<00:05:40.080> overall<00:05:40.560> except<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.190> at<00:05:41.340> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
decent filter overall except that at the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.780 
decent filter overall except that at the
internal<00:05:42.540> set
