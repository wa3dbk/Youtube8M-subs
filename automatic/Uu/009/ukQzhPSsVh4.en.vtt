looking at the materials of the board

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.100 
looking at the materials of the board
you<00:00:41.060> have<00:00:41.090> two<00:00:41.329> materials<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:41.960> have<00:00:42.020> a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
you have two materials you have a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.960 
you have two materials you have a
pre-tensioned<00:00:42.649> fiberglass<00:00:43.489> which<00:00:43.730> adds

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
pre-tensioned fiberglass which adds

turn<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.600> deck<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:47.960> that's<00:00:48.410> sandwiched

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
turn to the deck and that's sandwiched

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.200 
turn to the deck and that's sandwiched
around<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.870> bamboo<00:00:51.559> wood<00:00:52.070> core<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.059> got

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
around a bamboo wood core so you got

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.819 
around a bamboo wood core so you got
fiberglass<00:00:53.750> on<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:53.989> top<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.380> bottom<00:00:54.530> and

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
fiberglass on the top and bottom and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.940 
fiberglass on the top and bottom and
then<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.219> bamboo<00:00:55.850> wood<00:00:56.270> core<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.840> between<00:00:57.410> cool

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
then a bamboo wood core in between cool

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.080 
then a bamboo wood core in between cool
thing<00:00:58.040> about<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.250> bamboo<00:00:58.520> wood<00:00:58.640> core<00:00:58.880> it's

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
thing about the bamboo wood core it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.810 
thing about the bamboo wood core it's
got<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.270> technology<00:00:59.899> called<00:01:00.469> fat<00:01:00.890> bottom<00:01:01.520> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
got a technology called fat bottom and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.790 
got a technology called fat bottom and
what<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:02.989> actually<00:01:03.230> thicker<00:01:03.530> in

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
what this is is it's actually thicker in

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.010 
what this is is it's actually thicker in
the<00:01:03.860> middle<00:01:04.309> than<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.239> at<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.570> edges<00:01:05.899> that

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the middle than it is at the edges that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.539 
the middle than it is at the edges that
gives<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.409> strength<00:01:06.710> where<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:07.310> need<00:01:07.520> it

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
gives you the strength where you need it

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.249 
gives you the strength where you need it
but<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.149> also<00:01:08.270> lightens<00:01:08.749> up<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.020> board

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
but it also lightens up the board

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.289 
but it also lightens up the board
because<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.740> takes<00:01:09.950> away<00:01:10.130> material<00:01:10.579> at<00:01:10.729> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
because it takes away material at the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.239 
because it takes away material at the
edges<00:01:11.719> couple<00:01:12.229> cool<00:01:12.350> things<00:01:12.409> going<00:01:12.859> on<00:01:12.950> with

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249 
edges couple cool things going on with

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:14.410 
edges couple cool things going on with
those<00:01:13.429> edges<00:01:13.759> because<00:01:14.090> there's<00:01:14.270> less

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
those edges because there's less

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.349 
those edges because there's less
material<00:01:14.959> you<00:01:15.319> actually<00:01:15.709> have<00:01:15.920> more<00:01:16.819> space

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
material you actually have more space

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.580 
material you actually have more space
for<00:01:17.719> bigger<00:01:18.020> wheels

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
for bigger wheels

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.679 
for bigger wheels
another<00:01:19.100> thing<00:01:19.279> that<00:01:19.310> adds<00:01:19.609> to<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.329> amount<00:01:20.569> of

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
another thing that adds to the amount of

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.989 
another thing that adds to the amount of
wheel<00:01:21.109> space<00:01:21.679> that<00:01:21.889> you<00:01:22.009> have<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.369> what's<00:01:22.819> they

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
wheel space that you have is what's they

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.109 
wheel space that you have is what's they
called<00:01:23.529> 3d<00:01:24.529> wheel<00:01:25.069> wells<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.670> again<00:01:25.909> this

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
called 3d wheel wells and again this

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.629 
called 3d wheel wells and again this
just<00:01:26.270> allows<00:01:26.420> wheels<00:01:26.779> up<00:01:27.109> to<00:01:27.469> 75<00:01:28.130> millimeters

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
just allows wheels up to 75 millimeters

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.849 
just allows wheels up to 75 millimeters
to<00:01:29.060> be<00:01:29.149> placed<00:01:29.420> on<00:01:29.569> this<00:01:29.869> board<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.679> ride

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
to be placed on this board and you ride

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.309 
to be placed on this board and you ride
it<00:01:31.009> comfortably<00:01:31.749> you've<00:01:32.749> also<00:01:32.869> got<00:01:33.049> something

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
it comfortably you've also got something

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.230 
it comfortably you've also got something
called<00:01:33.469> sharp<00:01:33.859> edges<00:01:34.099> which<00:01:34.729> just<00:01:34.909> allows<00:01:35.209> for

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
called sharp edges which just allows for

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.749 
called sharp edges which just allows for
your<00:01:35.659> feet<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.899> really<00:01:36.380> lock<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.520> board

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
your feet to really lock in to the board

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.550 
your feet to really lock in to the board
when<00:01:38.119> you're<00:01:38.270> getting<00:01:38.450> sideways<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.079> making
