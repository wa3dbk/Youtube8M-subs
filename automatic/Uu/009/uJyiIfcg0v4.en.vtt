00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.619
 on the 50 free course 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 european championship of he is

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.060
 the place 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.679
 which had been a record time of 11 1% to 9 05 actually seven mass graves 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:56.049

 months 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.209
 given my size banks the five years to become one of the hardships 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.059
 of predilection right after his match but I'm starting to see a quarter of 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.099
 52nd luxury 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.440
 we even think source

 ten children or the times where he as well placed and then especially for better 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.590
 identify it a lot of points before the rise will eat not been easy but 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.260
 I think the combinations between the more hungry his opponents 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.620
 today we are swimming 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.400

 listened to win the qualification 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 and after I think the fight is going to be tight 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.840
 as today we agree 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.749
 to continue producing because the real battle is taking place this summer 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.669
 yaka places to be filled including two days on 100 meters 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.729

 we follow the first full moon and the progression 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.830
 and we are going to have a little and that bousquet that makes us kind 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.990
 let's mention that the amount of ammo I did everything that is
