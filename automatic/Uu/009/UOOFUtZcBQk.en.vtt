00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
sure about that one and then I got

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.610 
sure about that one and then I got
cactus<00:03:16.120> flower<00:03:16.330> which<00:03:16.570> was<00:03:16.810> really<00:03:17.110> excited

my<00:03:22.989> cheeks<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.470> now<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.910> only<00:03:25.000> need<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.330> tiny

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
my cheeks right now you only need a tiny

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.280 
my cheeks right now you only need a tiny
bit<00:03:25.900> because<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.830> really<00:03:27.430> pigmented<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.290> I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
bit because it is really pigmented and I

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.000 
bit because it is really pigmented and I
think<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.220> actually<00:03:30.370> over<00:03:30.820> applied<00:03:31.150> already<00:03:32.010> so

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
that's the color in the pan and this is

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.890 
that's the color in the pan and this is
the<00:03:35.230> color<00:03:35.410> on<00:03:35.500> my<00:03:35.620> cheeks<00:03:35.650> um<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:37.450> one<00:03:37.690> for

the color on my cheeks um this one for

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.520 
the color on my cheeks um this one for
some<00:03:38.020> reason<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.470> covered<00:03:38.860> in<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.040> film<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.520> oil

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
some reason is covered in a film of oil

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.330 
some reason is covered in a film of oil
but<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:42.060> comes<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.410> sort<00:03:44.830> of<00:03:44.950> it's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
but that comes like that sort of it's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.290 
but that comes like that sort of it's
just<00:03:45.640> on<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:47.190> uppermost<00:03:48.190> layer<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.090> once

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
just on the uppermost layer so that once

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.780 
just on the uppermost layer so that once
you<00:03:49.570> start<00:03:50.530> using<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.220> bit<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.459> actually

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you start using it the bit you actually

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.960 
you start using it the bit you actually
use<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.209> not<00:03:52.239> actually<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.200> oily<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.730> I'll

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
use is not actually that oily so I'll

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.510 
use is not actually that oily so I'll
swatch<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.709> if<00:03:56.830> I<00:03:56.890> take<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.100> bit<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.489> my

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
swatch that so if I take a bit on my

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.760 
swatch that so if I take a bit on my
finger<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.570> bright<00:03:58.959> color<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.560> same

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.120 
finger it is that bright color the same
colors<00:04:00.130> in<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.340> pan<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:01.410> what<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.650> do<00:04:02.800> is

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
colors in the pan and what you can do is

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.300 
colors in the pan and what you can do is
um<00:04:03.690> I'll<00:04:04.690> do<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:04.959> here<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.530> top<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.100> peach

shadow<00:04:36.139> colors<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:38.199> as<00:04:39.199> far<00:04:39.229> as<00:04:39.530> i<00:04:39.680> know<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:40.039> i

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
shadow colors so as far as i know now i

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.809 
shadow colors so as far as i know now i
would<00:04:40.460> recommend<00:04:41.530> cactus<00:04:42.530> flower<00:04:42.770> i<00:04:43.190> think<00:04:43.729> it

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
would recommend cactus flower i think it

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.219 
would recommend cactus flower i think it
would<00:04:43.910> suit<00:04:44.090> every<00:04:44.509> skin<00:04:44.750> tone<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.110> you're

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
would suit every skin tone if you're

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.589 
would suit every skin tone if you're
darker<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.460> build<00:04:46.729> up<00:04:46.970> into<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> more

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
darker you can build up into a more

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.700 
darker you can build up into a more
intense<00:04:47.960> red<00:04:48.259> so<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:48.800> do<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.099> now<00:04:50.710> so

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
intense red so you can do that now so

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.040 
intense red so you can do that now so
say<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.280> apply<00:04:52.669> three<00:04:53.090> times<00:04:53.330> as<00:04:53.509> much<00:04:53.630> it'll

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
say you apply three times as much it'll

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.909 
say you apply three times as much it'll
end<00:04:54.199> up<00:04:54.320> being<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:55.400> really<00:04:55.940> bright<00:04:56.330> almost
