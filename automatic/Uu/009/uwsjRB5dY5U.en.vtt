from<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> point<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> view<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.530> these<00:02:04.979> free

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
from the point of view of these free

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.249 
from the point of view of these free
speech<00:02:05.549> advocacy<00:02:06.060> groups<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.899> necessarily

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
speech advocacy groups not necessarily

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
speech advocacy groups not necessarily
this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.829> general<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
this one but in general I think that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
this one but in general I think that
they're<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> business<00:02:11.340> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they're not really in the business of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.120 
they're not really in the business of
picking<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.180> choosing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
picking and choosing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.190 
picking and choosing
speech<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.820> they<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.420> their<00:02:14.960> thing

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
speech like they it's just their thing

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800 
speech like they it's just their thing
is<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.500> defend<00:02:15.860> free<00:02:16.370> speech<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.240> I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
is to defend free speech and you know I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.210 
is to defend free speech and you know I
I<00:02:17.870> don't<00:02:18.200> agree<00:02:18.380> with<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.710> though<00:02:18.920> oh<00:02:19.130> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
I don't agree with that though oh I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.290 
I don't agree with that though oh I
think<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.610> they're<00:02:19.730> wrong<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.120> case

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
think that they're wrong in this case

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.450 
think that they're wrong in this case
yeah<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.990> think<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.440> might<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.650> why<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.860> don't

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
yeah I think that might be why I don't

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.160 
yeah I think that might be why I don't
think<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.790> free<00:02:23.030> speech<00:02:23.270> advocacy<00:02:23.900> groups

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
think that free speech advocacy groups

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.890 
think that free speech advocacy groups
defend<00:02:24.650> all<00:02:24.890> speech<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:25.790> it's<00:02:26.030> speech<00:02:26.600> that
