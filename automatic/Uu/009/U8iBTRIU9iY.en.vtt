00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 all right 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.490
 hello welcome to all 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.160
 I am sets and this is going to be a very video 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.740
 fast in the I'm going to give you 5 tips 5 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.989
 tricks or 5 tips on how to do 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.239
 photographs with the mobile how to use 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.310
 the camera of the mobile and get the most 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.200
 match well be android and windows phone 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.970
 or uncles all the cameras of the mobiles 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.530
 they will work more or less the same 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 obviously some cameras are going to be 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 better than others but that does not come 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.660
 Within our competence we are going to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.090
 try to make some common points between 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.190
 all the cameras in the world cameras in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.590
 the mobiles I mean well first 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.450
 advice and perhaps the most obvious but a lot 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.190
 people do not have it still very much in 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.200
 the head tries to always have a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 direct access to the camera is worth 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.490
 everything if the mobile is Android you can 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.420
 put it even in the screensaver 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.840
 same from the phone in front of the mobile 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.460
 with this you are going to save a lot 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.110
 a lot of time losses at the time 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.280
 to take a photograph keep in 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350
 account that one of the big 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.630
 in a mobile camera is power 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.030
 dispose of it immediately if 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.260
 you are constantly looking for the camera 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.260
 you lose that immediate 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.719
 x 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.940
 and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.620
 lighting is important 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.600
 sensors of mobile cameras 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 they are not usually very good then the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 truth is that if there is little lighting the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 photo will come out with your churri to some 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.130
 my camera's directive has nothing is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 perfect very well the flash is fine 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.670
 but you have to take a little care 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 with the disguise of you have to know 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 use it does not always come right anymore 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.490
 Sometimes you can burn the image and leave the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:21.300
 subject if you want to photograph the house 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:24.180
 but the fourth council zoomed well the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.209
 use of zoom you have to be careful 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
 you have to not use the zoom of the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.930
 mobile cameras is a zoom 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.920
 digital is not optical what does it mean 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.260
 this being a digital zoom what is 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.780
 doing is to take the image and stretch it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.820
 enlarge the voucher is not using 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.140
 lenses like in the case of cameras 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.060
 that yes there is a game of intense 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.560
 optical zoom action there is no loss of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.300
 definition while with the zoom of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.910
 mobile you're losing all definition 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:57.410
 and you will get some pixels like fists 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.410
 with those photos is far away 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.420
 get closer a little not funny that I 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.640
 I do not move but if you do not pay attention to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.010
 an image do not do it is an occasion 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 about signatures during the photo come 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.870
 bag not water photo voucher 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.720
 good has been 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.950
 fourth apps or apps this is more 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.739
 in the case of android there are many 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.810
 applications to use the camera what 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.489
 yours is that you experiment with all and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.860
 which you see which one you like most obviously 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.459
 trying to use a lot of the effects 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.970
 of saturated cold jenson contrast 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.970
 effects 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.860
 because you are going to upload your photograph and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.330
 let's be honest and a photograph 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.340
 you need to apply many effects I'm going 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.630
 to recommend five more applications and 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.920
 less are those that I have been testing and 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.170
 more I like it a lot we will give it the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.750
 putting here the chopping studio photo 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.600
 2 the photo editor had the three in 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.270
 stripe and popeye in four the pixel to 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.160
 l'express I think I said well and for 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.080
 the peak with the collage what we're going 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.780
 to do is this typical of making collage 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.370
 with the images how you have seen 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.049
 lots of times and the time written a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.820
 series of pretty cool parameters for 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.820
 be able to customize the way we 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.860
 and finally although this is not so 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.630
 dedicated to photography but the video 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.130
 it does not stop being the camera of the mobile and it is 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.230
 something I want to make quite clear 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.320
 as in his day he says with the theme of 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.270
 thirds that I despair not according to the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.270
 law of thirds and videos in 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.220
 vertical format by god is not not 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.560
 terrible is horrible is the worst is the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.370
 hitler of the audiovisual if you go to 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.090
 record a video do not do it like that 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.260
 no, your monitor is not like that 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.210
 I want to say maybe someone has 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.710
 empty monitor or the laptop puts it on 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.169
 in the classroom bed and he likes to see the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.820
 videos like this but not the videos 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.770
 in landscape horizontally is what 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.419
 normal is always the typical I'm leaving 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.790
 to show a video and the video is in 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.790
 vertical format I can not with it 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.949
 feel 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.750
 to see see 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.720
 is personal 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.020
 it is more serious 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:36.860
 a lot by the way you will not have a 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.430
 little incense from the other day 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.430
