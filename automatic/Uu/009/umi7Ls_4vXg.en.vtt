00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
so you could shoot around corners and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.930 
so you could shoot around corners and
the<00:02:33.830> trigger<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.910> site<00:02:39.940> even

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the trigger is on this the site even

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.600 
the trigger is on this the site even
though<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.450> gun<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.079> turned<00:02:42.799> out<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.099> angle<00:02:43.519> at

though the gun is turned out of angle at

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.479 
though the gun is turned out of angle at
stowe<00:02:43.879> shoots<00:02:48.190> much<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:51.290> that's<00:02:51.890> awesome

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
stowe shoots much see that's awesome

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.319 
stowe shoots much see that's awesome
this<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.480> mechanism<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
this is a mechanism here you can see the

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.309 
this is a mechanism here you can see the
trigger<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:58.640> what<00:02:58.940> makes<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.079> gun

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
trigger so that's what makes the gun

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.330 
trigger so that's what makes the gun
shoot<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> knob<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.310> other

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
shoot so so a knob here on the other

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.660 
shoot so so a knob here on the other
