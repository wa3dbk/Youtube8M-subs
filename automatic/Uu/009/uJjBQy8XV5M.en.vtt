00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.750
 with power 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.440
 Now we wait for our team 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
 turn on 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.940

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.900

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.900
 cent of the load 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.290
 very well here we should only wait 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.310
 in this part they should have a bit of 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.510
 patience because 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.430
 It usually takes two or three minutes 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.350
 then they will not remove the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.600
 drums 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.600
 we simply wait 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.890
 very well and the street will end 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
