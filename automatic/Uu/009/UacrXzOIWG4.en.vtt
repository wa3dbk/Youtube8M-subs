designers we're looking at something in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.179 
designers we're looking at something in

the seven out 7.5 ounce range for the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
the seven out 7.5 ounce range for the
mins<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.570> that's<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.560> know

mins so that's going to be you know
significantly<00:01:20.250> lighter<00:01:20.549> than<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> kinabalu

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
significantly lighter than the kinabalu

and<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.160> long<00:02:30.370> at<00:02:30.550> all<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
and it's not really that long at all I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.460 
and it's not really that long at all I
don't<00:02:31.450> even<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> last<00:02:32.170> foal

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
don't even have it in the last foal

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.089 
don't even have it in the last foal
there<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:35.050> they<00:02:35.440> don't<00:02:35.560> come<00:02:35.800> undone

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
there and it they don't come undone

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.190 
there and it they don't come undone
nearly<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:36.880> much<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.239> as<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> kin<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:38.080> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
nearly as much as as the kin of all the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.440 
nearly as much as as the kin of all the
laces<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:39.130> big<00:02:39.700> improvement<00:02:40.330> and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
laces would so big improvement and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.259 
laces would so big improvement and
design<00:02:40.780> there<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.739> real<00:02:42.010> lightweight<00:02:42.790> mesh

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
design there and a real lightweight mesh

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.229 
design there and a real lightweight mesh
tongue<00:02:43.660> that's<00:02:44.410> quite<00:02:44.620> flexible<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.850> know

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
tongue that's quite flexible so you know

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.449 
tongue that's quite flexible so you know
the<00:02:46.510> fit<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.959> think<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> little<00:02:47.470> bit<00:02:47.739> more

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the fit I think is a little bit more

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.430 
the fit I think is a little bit more
flexible<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.269> upper<00:02:49.750> than<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.049> kinabalu

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
flexible on the upper than the kinabalu

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.910 
flexible on the upper than the kinabalu
it's<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.610> fit<00:02:51.760> more<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.330> TTC<00:02:53.049> evo

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
it's going to fit more like the TTC evo

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.039 
it's going to fit more like the TTC evo

specialist but this shoe I think is

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.300 
specialist but this shoe I think is
really<00:03:01.750> entering<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.140> lot<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.349> heads<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.799> the

excited<00:03:05.739> for<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.970> come<00:03:07.120> out<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.420> 2014<00:03:08.910> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
excited for it to come out in 2014 so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.960 
excited for it to come out in 2014 so
out<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> trails<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:11.440> shoe<00:03:11.650> really<00:03:12.100> holds

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
out on the trails the shoe really holds

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.880

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
tested it extensively in anybody

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.259

in<00:03:19.329> Boulder<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.290> dry<00:03:20.560> rocks<00:03:20.829> grips<00:03:21.670> very<00:03:21.940> well

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
in Boulder but dry rocks grips very well

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.380 
in Boulder but dry rocks grips very well
in<00:03:22.390> any<00:03:22.569> dirty<00:03:22.870> crooks<00:03:23.260> very<00:03:23.500> well<00:03:24.090> some<00:03:25.090> snow

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
in any dirty crooks very well some snow

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.289 
in any dirty crooks very well some snow
and<00:03:25.420> icy<00:03:25.900> conditions<00:03:26.019> I'd<00:03:26.650> say<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.640> was<00:03:28.030> a

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
and icy conditions I'd say that it was a

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.690 
and icy conditions I'd say that it was a
little<00:03:28.810> there<00:03:29.140> was<00:03:29.290> some<00:03:29.470> slippage<00:03:29.920> but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
little there was some slippage but

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.580 
little there was some slippage but
really<00:03:30.910> depends<00:03:31.359> on<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.019> temperature

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
really depends on what the temperature

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.340 
really depends on what the temperature
is<00:03:32.620> how<00:03:33.310> deep<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.670> snow<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.209> if<00:03:35.170> you're

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
is how deep the snow is if you're

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.050 
is how deep the snow is if you're
running<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.799> know<00:03:35.829> down<00:03:36.160> bear<00:03:36.459> peak<00:03:36.730> or<00:03:37.000> a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
running you know down bear peak or a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.599 
running you know down bear peak or a
mountain<00:03:37.590> obviously<00:03:38.590> you're<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.549> be

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
mountain obviously you're going to be

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.970 
mountain obviously you're going to be
slipping<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.329> lot<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.019> different<00:03:41.319> shoes<00:03:41.560> so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
slipping a lot of different shoes so

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.660 
slipping a lot of different shoes so
that's<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.269> one<00:03:43.510> thing<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:44.019> consider<00:03:44.670> in

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
that's that's one thing to consider in

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.250 
that's that's one thing to consider in
terms<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:46.000> performance<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.870> think<00:03:46.930> this

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
terms of performance I think this

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.949 
terms of performance I think this
lightweight<00:03:47.560> package<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:49.180> going<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.690> a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
lightweight package is going to be a

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.740 
lightweight package is going to be a
great<00:03:50.859> hit<00:03:51.220> especially<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:52.030> people<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.690> the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
great hit especially for people on the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.480 
great hit especially for people on the
trails<00:03:53.139> or<00:03:53.440> try<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.709> run

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
trails or try to run

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.900 
trails or try to run
fast<00:03:54.880> run<00:03:55.330> more<00:03:55.540> efficiently<00:03:55.680> as<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.550> know

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
fast run more efficiently as you know

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.970 
fast run more efficiently as you know
quite<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.180> bit<00:03:58.240> more<00:03:58.630> on<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.290> minimal<00:03:59.740> side

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
quite a bit more on the minimal side

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.820 
quite a bit more on the minimal side
then<00:04:00.280> they<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.550> evolve<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.830> definitely

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
then they can evolve and definitely

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.090 
then they can evolve and definitely
feels<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.520> lot<00:04:03.760> lighter<00:04:04.060> get<00:04:04.990> up<00:04:05.110> more<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:06.010> your

feels a lot lighter get up more on your

feels a lot lighter get up more on your
