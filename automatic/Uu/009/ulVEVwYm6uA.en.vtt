00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:23.539
 another episode last show of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.539
 dream pvp today with the key support 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.900
 with us and yes we have it completely new 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 just built the forest was then 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.250
 the one and a half hours then fits faith 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 I am following a completely new principle 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:50.130
 clears up so crucial possible 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.290
 to register 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.830
 then normally you run then you learn 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.739
 you read through the rules 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.780
 but but 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.790
 then 10 was eight or just eight 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.790
 bought the ranks are behind 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 you have bought yourself before that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 read through 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.890
 These are the rules for the ranks and yes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.440
 I do not have that for the other one yet 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.600
 you made before her first server 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.619
 rule break and everything else because 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.040
 then have the people nevertheless times 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.000
 complains why they have rahden 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.450
 Anyway , we have one now 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.550
 carlos because you will always 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.369
 kicked it finds a certain time 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.810
 did not want to 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 Anyway , it's wrong again 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.990
 us up here is on pvp of course 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 down here is on the pvp to the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.970
 Monsters can not hurt you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.890
 do 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.030
 and that's why it's for you to run 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.329
 nature conservation at the beginning you can also 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.160
 turn it off clearly and then I have to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:14.210
 show the protection now 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.900
 so close now are just 24 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
 people are little else than me 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
 closed the server for 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:30.290
 one and a half hours and forty people 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:33.970
 on it and yes the kit beginners can do that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.970
 you recover 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.250
 and yes, then so could through the world 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.260
 to run 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.080
 you can create your own 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.190
 make plan 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:58.910
 you can do that with sf eg you have to krad 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:04.210
 at least that's not what app is about 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:16.250
 free land and yes I do not understand 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:18.230
 We build a completely new map of course shop 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.830
 of course also mob arena comes 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.600
 Of course, maybe from letter to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.670
 we think and an event that 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.310
 event for believe I up here with the same 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.310
 then what then 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.859
 be every Friday and every Sunday 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.450
 I would say 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:48.510
 and yes, that's why I wish you much 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:52.219

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:57.629
 I cry so okay it was 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.760
