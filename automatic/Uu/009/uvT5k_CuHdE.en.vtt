00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
think that's great like that would be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.929 
think that's great like that would be
totally<00:01:46.350> awesome<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.920> could<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
totally awesome if I could do that that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
totally awesome if I could do that that
idea<00:01:48.180> definitely<00:01:48.930> appeals<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.920> it's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
idea definitely appeals to me but it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.550 
idea definitely appeals to me but it's
just<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.729> realistic<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> go

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
just not realistic in the way that I go

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
just not realistic in the way that I go
