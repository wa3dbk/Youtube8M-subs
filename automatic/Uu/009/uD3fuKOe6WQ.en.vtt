00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
connecting you should see the Wi-Fi

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
connecting you should see the Wi-Fi
search<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.509> an<00:01:57.659> IP<00:01:57.810> address<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
search out an IP address and there it is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
search out an IP address and there it is
connected<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.850> no<00:02:00.030> ethernet<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
connected as you can see no ethernet is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
connected as you can see no ethernet is
still<00:02:01.049> taking<00:02:01.259> precedence<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.610> i<00:02:02.640> need

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
still taking precedence so what i need

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.310 
still taking precedence so what i need
to<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.210> go<00:02:03.509> ahead<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> remove

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to do is just go ahead and remove

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160 
to do is just go ahead and remove
ethernet<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.780> can

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
ethernet just like that and now we can

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.859 
ethernet just like that and now we can
actually<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.530> testing<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
actually start testing this out with the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.100 
actually start testing this out with the
4g<00:02:10.560> LTE<00:02:10.950> hotspot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
over to speedtest net I ping is really

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300 
over to speedtest net I ping is really
low<00:02:17.210> as<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.630> see<00:02:17.900> 65<00:02:18.500> milliseconds<00:02:18.800> and

low as you can see 65 milliseconds and
the<00:02:19.790> download<00:02:20.180> speed<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.570> about<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.780> third<00:02:21.140> of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
the download speed it's about a third of

the download speed it's about a third of
my<00:02:21.560> mobile<00:02:21.980> or<00:02:22.370> my<00:02:22.520> home<00:02:22.790> broadband

my mobile or my home broadband
connection<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.020> still<00:02:24.230> really<00:02:24.560> good

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
connection but that's still really good

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.860

for<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.550> mobile<00:02:26.000> connection<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:26.690> is

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
for a mobile connection and this is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.200 
for a mobile connection and this is
solid<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.500> mean<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.160> only<00:02:28.550> lower<00:02:28.850> end<00:02:29.090> of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
solid I mean this is only lower end of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.090 
solid I mean this is only lower end of
the<00:02:29.240> scale<00:02:29.390> i've<00:02:29.600> been<00:02:29.750> getting<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:30.560> faster

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
the scale i've been getting way faster

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.310 
the scale i've been getting way faster
than<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.400> actually<00:02:31.640> now<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.510> uploads<00:02:33.050> beat

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
than that actually now the uploads beat

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.680 
than that actually now the uploads beat
is<00:02:33.500> super<00:02:34.220> impressive<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:35.030> you'll<00:02:35.180> see<00:02:35.390> here

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
is super impressive as you'll see here

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230 
is super impressive as you'll see here
look<00:02:35.900> at<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.200> almost<00:02:36.980> 10<00:02:37.220> megabits<00:02:37.700> down<00:02:37.970> or

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
look at that almost 10 megabits down or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.890 
look at that almost 10 megabits down or
up<00:02:38.570> as<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.320> can<00:02:39.440> see<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.330> smashes<00:02:41.330> my

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
up as you can see so that smashes my

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.390 
up as you can see so that smashes my
home<00:02:42.140> broadband<00:02:42.620> service<00:02:43.040> where<00:02:43.220> i<00:02:43.250> was

home broadband service where i was

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.730 
home broadband service where i was
getting<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.760> 3<00:02:44.090> megabits<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.650> can

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
getting like 3 megabits up so as you can

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.400 
getting like 3 megabits up so as you can
see<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.130> LTE<00:02:46.760> hotspot<00:02:47.420> contain<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.260> the
