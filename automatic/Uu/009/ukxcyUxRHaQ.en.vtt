00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.100
 very complicated question because if 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.410

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.760

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.170
 many things what I can tell you is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.329
 that the craziest thing that happened to me 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.700
 lately what I remember is that I was 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.230
 in the VIP with Gabriel and we went to 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.660
 eat pizza in a wonderful place 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.040
 I knew very well and thor I told him 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.159
 It's been a while since I liked the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.469
 food 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.479
 then ask for food to carry 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:14.219
 groups that I like but I said 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.219
 oh how bad it is because the food 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.969
 and how can you bring this pizza to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.039
 I do not find someone on the street and 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.000
 if I can give it away I go with my pizza 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.899
 excited or if I am a good human being 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 I see a homeless 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.380
 and I say perfect me good day action 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.899
 You are hungry because I have this thought 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.899
 what is new studying 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.320
 the gentleman has begun to beat me screams and 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 to insult me 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.450
 the truth I never understood very well that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.890
 I was saying because I was hitting 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.100
 screams and said a lot of things and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.689
 I had a sign asking for money and it's not 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 a person that I tell a person 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.590
 so they are hungry take and the person 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 she feels offended was a person who 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.970
 I was on the street asking men 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:17.340
 money and food and I that new pizza and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.560
 he started hitting the whole world watching the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.550
 dude I did not want to grab the pizza and I 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 I screamed and I 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.080
 happy happy night until soon you have 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.030
 today that you have a happy night wants to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.860
 less than aesthetic surgery tolerance 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.600
 or none of that I think that everyone 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.730
 you must do what you want to do with your 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.200
 body if that will make you feel the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.400
 noise 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.080
 obviously there are aesthetics that go 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 changing through time as - 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.440
 when they came out in a gigantic 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.780
 well it was gigantic being now they are 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.880
 like pop and super gigantic and I 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.010
 for me and I would never want that for me 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.910
 pettitte little body but what I know 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.060
 wants to do to me every one makes his 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.560
 what ever you want so of course 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.210
 tolerance tolerance because if someone 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.620
 does something of his body is because he would have 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.330
 what affect you will say to me does not affect me 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.140
 then it's okay that everyone is 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.140
 do what you want to do 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.590
 for blue he asked how much you 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.120
 you delayed in learning English tell us 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.590
 your story of how was your process with 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.629
 the anime language you would be in a video 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.120
 complete about all that process for a hundred 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.550
 it's a very long process but actually 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.530
 I when I get everything they knew 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.920
 English did not know through television 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.080
 movie music because I consumed irak in 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.989
 English then I already had an English 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.180
 that I had taught myself watching 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.180
 television series other movies 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.590
 when I arrived here I already had 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.810
 how it was like the sixth level of the eight 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.040
 levels 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.799
 good 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.569
 level but I will always want it better 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.790
 then for me a process that still 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.790
 It is not over and it will not end anymore
