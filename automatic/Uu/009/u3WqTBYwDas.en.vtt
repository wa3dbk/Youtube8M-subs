00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 good for this new seat leon we start 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.919
 right from the infotainment because it makes a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.769
 step forward compared to the old one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.639
 version on reform a little to the cousins ​​of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.400
 audi with the en.aip audi system 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.210
 touchscreen we can go to click 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 directly on the 5-inch display 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 all the insertion part 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.460
 the media opens the drawer 2 sd 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.600
 the cd is the media in or the connector 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 to which they can then be connected 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 iphone ipod usb keys and more 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.149
 here flying with the controls for 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.010
 recommend if infotainment is the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.870
 bluetooth module for telephony 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.219
 very particular central plank 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 vertical 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 good materials also of the seats us 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.550
 we are obviously approving the version 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 more equipped than trying 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.470
 looking here at the Paris salon and one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.650
 world premiere 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 engines ranging from 1200 to 2000 tsi e 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.920
 tdi but preview on this leon the headlights 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.280
 completely led 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.510
 not only daytime running lights but also lights 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 high beam low beams are led 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.650
 if we look at the car body there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 we will notice the similarities with the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 cousin to three especially if we close the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.080
 door can't do it are 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 we wait for the leg the young lady but 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 even at the side of 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.619
 rear of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.210
 really lighting the similarities 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.070
 with the a3 there are also many of these 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.940
 smo graphics and this arrangement of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 headlights are very similar 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.730
 another novelty is the logos and that is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.280
 reused very large trunk 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.280
 composed of dividing two thirds a third
