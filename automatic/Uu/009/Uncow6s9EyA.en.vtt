00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.520 
when I bought a benefit mascara and this
is<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.130> bad<00:03:22.370> girl<00:03:22.730> lash<00:03:23.360> mascara<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.230> it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
is just the bad girl lash mascara and it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.200 
is just the bad girl lash mascara and it
came<00:03:24.710> with<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.950> regular<00:03:25.370> size<00:03:25.580> tube<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.030> mascara

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
so I just keep that in there and I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.760 
so I just keep that in there and I
hardly<00:03:28.700> ever<00:03:28.790> use<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.480> but<00:03:29.810> it's<00:03:29.990> in<00:03:30.170> there<00:03:30.410> and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
know those things I also have this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.460

sunglass<00:03:43.970> case<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.570> got<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.900> from<00:03:45.110> Target

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
sunglass case I got this from Target

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.620 
sunglass case I got this from Target
they<00:03:46.010> might<00:03:46.280> still<00:03:46.550> have<00:03:46.850> these<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.540> know

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
they might still have these but I know

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.440 
they might still have these but I know
they<00:03:47.930> definitely<00:03:48.350> have<00:03:48.980> other<00:03:49.430> styles<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
they definitely have other styles but I

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.480 
they definitely have other styles but I
like<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.930> because<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.590> has<00:03:51.800> little<00:03:52.100> flecks

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
like this because it has little flecks

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.580 
like this because it has little flecks
of<00:03:52.700> gold<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.330> matches<00:03:53.600> my<00:03:53.810> purse<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.530> my

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
of gold and it matches my purse and my

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.770 
of gold and it matches my purse and my
makeup<00:03:55.040> bag<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:55.970> everything<00:03:56.450> kind<00:03:56.660> of

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
makeup bag so everything kind of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.500 
makeup bag so everything kind of
court-made<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.790> good<00:03:59.300> way<00:03:59.480> to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
court-made but this is a good way to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.720 
court-made but this is a good way to
protect<00:03:59.959> my<00:04:00.380> sunglasses<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.459> they<00:04:01.550> don't
