 presented last September 10 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.149
 in the apple keynote while we 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.660
 they showed the power that the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.340
 iphone 5 s in this video game this time and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 play with one of them no more we are going to 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.860

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.470
 little bit together with ios 7 the next 18 of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.600
 September let's talk a little bit about 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.269
 ios 7 because we already know that the next 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.700
 September 18 will be available for 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.770
 everyone the final version plus me 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.990
 I already have the golden master and soon 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 I will tell you my feelings with this great 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 operating system that I'm liking 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.900
 very 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.970
 in addition also the next 18 of 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.729
 September we will have available the new 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.890
 itunes radio is a jazz service we have 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.540
 talked about him in 'streaming' music 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.330
 where we will be able to hear all the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.820
 music that is in itunes completely 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.290
 free yes, if we do not pay anything, we're going to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.750
 have to listen to advertising between 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.180
 song and song we can pay 25 euros 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.220
 what is the itunes match to not listen 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.320
 this advertising but good on horseback 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.119
 gifted do not look at him tried not 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.100
 let's talk about the break because they're going 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.929
 to leave as I said the year is 7 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.250
 and what happens with the jailbreak we will see a 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.460
 jailbreak we will have a jailbreak 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.660
 available when ios 7 comes out 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.369
 I know the truth is that nobody knows but 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.350
 the guys from and pedersen their twitter 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.820
 they are giving enough hope 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.250
 because it says one on one hand that they are already 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.990
 working in ios 7 in the jailbreak 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.640
 They also say that they have tried 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
 exploit of them that they had already 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.229
 saved to see if they work and it seems 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 that are working perfectly in 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.070
 ios 7 therefore it is quite 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.739
 hopeful and it seems that it seems that 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.510
 soon we will see a jailbreak in ios 7 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.160
 but the truth is that it seems that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.440
 it's going to be quite complicated to do 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.990
 the jailbreak 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.630
 5 s because the processor is different is 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.820
 64 bit has a structure that does not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.140
 we still know until the hackers 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.880
 do not see it, they will not be able to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 tell us a lot when it goes on the market 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.050
 we will see but it is possible that either not 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.420
 get a jailbreak until it too is 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.250
 available for that iphone 5 s or else 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.680
 based on the jailbreak for all 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 less devices for iphone 5 s 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.100
 but well let's not get ahead 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.630
 events we will wait a while to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.280
 see what happens 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.200
 Well, he wants to talk about Instagram 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.640
 one of my favorite social networks that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800
 by the way you can find me in 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.300
 instagram by s nothing 10 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.890
 well since facebook bought 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.420
 instagram the truth is that all 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.790
 we started to tremble because everyone 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.530
 we know mark zuckenberg well 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.020
 the truth is that now in him remove 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.490
 instagram business director says 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.760
 who have plans to monetize 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.680
 instagram as of 2014 therefore 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 as of that date surely 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.050
 we will see advertising in our or at 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.940
 minus my favorite social network I'm going to 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.710
 talk about the apple tv is the great 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.510
 forgotten by apple because 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.060
 many we expected at least that the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.190
 passed apple keynote to paul tell us 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.980
 something of the lace and that they would remove 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.020
 something new at least an app store 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.720
 so they could put applications in 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.180
 this great this great center platform 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.360
 multimedia not the certain thing is that it was not 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.510
 well but on 18 there is a new version 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.270
 available according to all digital things 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.930
 therefore we understand that it will be the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.480
 equivalent to 7 for the appletv is not the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.190
 perfect multimedia center that yes yes 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.380
 you have jailbreak and for a simple 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.330
 reason because with the jailbreak you 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.530
 can install applications 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.920
 applications of all kinds applications 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.650
 to see rss feed readers 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.630
 install applications for 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.200
 convert our TV output into a 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.450
 ln receiver we can install crowd 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.510
 of applications apolo has very simple 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.609
 you just have to take out an app store to 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.340
 that television is finally 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.800
 revolutionary and talking about television 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.410
 and of revolution we can not leave aside 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.500
 the new playstation vita 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.270
 I have taken a box very similar to 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 the appo of because mentioned before is 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.250
 a small box of 6 x 10 centimeters is a 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.910
 box that supports playstation games 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.460
 vita de p esp and playstation 1 of the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.530
 original that if all the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.450
 playstation vita games because 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.450
 example in your catalog at least 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.340
 he is still neither wipeout nor uncharted 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.930
 this is simply like a kind of 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.700
 console that connects to the internet and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.990
 work the applications also has 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.840
 a space to also put the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.220
 videogames in plan in memory sd and you 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.440
 you control it with the command of the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.330
 playstation the dual show that we have 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.220
 now for example on playstation3 and 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.680
 I understand that the playstation 4 also 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.250
 it will work not in addition to one thing that is 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.950
 bright is super cool we can send 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.770
 the image with this gadget we can 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.570
 send from next playstation 4 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.450
 playstation that will come out to a 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.250
 television any remotely without 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.840
 no need for any cable therefore 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.430
 as you are watching in this trailer 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.840
 our family can be doing 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.540
 a movie and we playing the 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.889
 playstation and talking about video games 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.110
 we can stop anything 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.300
 form of valve steam which is the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.580
 video game platform of all 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.499
 playing on pc of all peceros not 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.419
 Well, a news item has come out 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.759
 quite interesting now let's be able to 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.620
 share our purchases our 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.069
 video games purchased with our 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.469
 friends or family the beta of this is going to 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.580
 start functioning next week 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.189
 the truth is that they were very good times 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.110
 when we all play as a child with 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.479
 with video games that were that were in 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.460
 cedes were not on diskette and the 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.020
 We would go from one friend to another because 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.909
 try the video game and to enjoy 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.710
 all of this video game is becoming more 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.389
 difficult because for example with steam yes 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.800
 that you pay a video game very cheaply 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.719
 but then that video game can not come out 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.879
 from there you can only play you 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.340
 now they allow us to go back to the times 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.719
 of yesteryear and be able to lend all 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.029
 shopping for video games that we 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:23.639
 we do with steam that if only going to 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.960
 be able to play a person at a time good 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.219
 guys and girls because this has been all 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.509
 here I say goodbye, I hope that I have 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.120
 liked this news tour 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.249
 technological and we see each other or listen in 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.150
 a next video podcast and in aysén the 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.150
