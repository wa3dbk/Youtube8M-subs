00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.179 
know that that doesn't work pretty much
at<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> works<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.259> 32-bit<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
at all I think it works in 32-bit but I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
at all I think it works in 32-bit but I
haven't<00:01:53.759> tested<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.159> might

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
haven't tested it so you know I might

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
haven't tested it so you know I might
not<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.579> might<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> little<00:01:57.420> cautious<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.990> guess

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
not I might be a little cautious I guess

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
not I might be a little cautious I guess
anyway<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.299> Windows<00:02:00.600> 7<00:02:00.750> any

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.930 
but you'll see it's got a very nice
animation<00:05:11.139> down<00:05:11.290> here<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.340> works<00:05:12.610> really

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
animation down here and it works really

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.510 
animation down here and it works really
well<00:05:13.060> as<00:05:13.360> you'll<00:05:13.540> see<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.229> just<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.470> second<00:05:14.830> so

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
well as you'll see in just a second so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.760 
well as you'll see in just a second so
anyway<00:05:15.820> basically<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.990> will<00:05:17.110> see<00:05:17.350> that<00:05:17.560> this

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
anyway basically you will see that this

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.680 
anyway basically you will see that this
is<00:05:17.950> the<00:05:18.130> little<00:05:18.310> program<00:05:18.760> it's<00:05:19.090> very<00:05:19.150> simple

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
is the little program it's very simple

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.140 
is the little program it's very simple
and<00:05:19.840> this<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.680> basically<00:05:21.370> what<00:05:21.760> you're<00:05:21.970> a

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
and this is basically what you're a

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.060 
and this is basically what you're a
little<00:05:22.419> preview<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.900> what<00:05:23.229> your<00:05:23.440> logon

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
little preview of what your logon

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.750 
little preview of what your logon
background<00:05:24.550> was<00:05:24.820> going<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.120> look<00:05:25.240> like<00:05:25.389> so

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
background was going to look like so

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
background was going to look like so
obviously<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.910> can<00:05:28.060> see<00:05:28.240> this<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.510> what<00:05:28.630> mine

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
obviously you can see this is what mine

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.240 
obviously you can see this is what mine
looks<00:05:28.810> like<00:05:29.020> right<00:05:29.260> now<00:05:29.410> just<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.830> default

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
looks like right now just the default

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.550 
looks like right now just the default
now<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.000> can<00:05:31.270> change<00:05:31.479> it<00:05:31.720> okay

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
now you can change it okay

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.310 
now you can change it okay
so<00:05:32.979> you<00:05:33.039> have<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.220> couple<00:05:33.400> options<00:05:33.610> here<00:05:33.910> for

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
so you have a couple options here for

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.510 
so you have a couple options here for
one<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.650> can<00:05:35.800> go<00:05:35.919> through<00:05:36.130> some<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.430> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
one you can go through some of the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.340 
one you can go through some of the
default<00:05:36.850> ones<00:05:37.030> up<00:05:37.270> here<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:37.780> like<00:05:37.960> let's<00:05:38.200> say

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
default ones up here so like let's say

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.060 
default ones up here so like let's say
not<00:05:38.889> this<00:05:39.190> one<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:40.090> was<00:05:40.240> kind<00:05:40.389> nice<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:41.680> one

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
not this one that was kind nice this one

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.730 
not this one that was kind nice this one
and<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.729> can<00:05:43.030> go<00:05:43.120> all<00:05:43.330> all<00:05:43.780> along<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.530> lines

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
and you can go all all along the lines

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.080 
and you can go all all along the lines
so<00:05:45.130> we<00:05:45.310> can<00:05:45.639> go<00:05:45.760> through<00:05:46.090> say<00:05:46.690> I<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.139> this<00:05:47.260> one

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
so we can go through say I like this one

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.430 
so we can go through say I like this one
now<00:05:49.090> there's<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.419> couple<00:05:49.660> other<00:05:49.750> things<00:05:49.840> let's

just one minute okay so if you don't do
anything<00:07:08.289> obviously<00:07:08.919> this<00:07:09.099> is<00:07:09.280> what<00:07:09.430> your

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
logon wallpaper is going to look like

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.640 
logon wallpaper is going to look like
but<00:07:12.490> after<00:07:12.940> you<00:07:13.090> use<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.509> program<00:07:13.960> it's<00:07:14.349> going

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
but after you use the program it's going

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.800 
but after you use the program it's going
to<00:07:14.800> turn<00:07:15.009> into<00:07:15.280> something<00:07:15.970> just<00:07:16.360> a<00:07:16.509> little<00:07:16.539> bit

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
to turn into something just a little bit

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.740 
to turn into something just a little bit
like<00:07:17.139> this<00:07:17.729> so<00:07:18.729> as<00:07:18.880> you<00:07:19.000> can<00:07:19.090> see<00:07:19.330> it<00:07:19.569> looks

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
like this so as you can see it looks

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.140 
like this so as you can see it looks
really<00:07:19.810> pretty<00:07:20.259> cool<00:07:20.740> and<00:07:21.340> obviously<00:07:21.729> you<00:07:21.970> can

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
really pretty cool and obviously you can
