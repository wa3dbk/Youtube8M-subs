00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello it's dancey today I've mixed my

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.210 
hello it's dancey today I've mixed my
lye<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:05.100> water<00:00:05.450> and<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:07.410> hot<00:00:07.680> night<00:00:08.069> I

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
lye and water and the hot night I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.180 
lye and water and the hot night I
measured<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.269> my<00:00:09.420> oil<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:10.080> making<00:00:10.500> soap<00:00:10.740> okay

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
measured out my oil I'm making soap okay

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.970 
measured out my oil I'm making soap okay
this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> third<00:00:11.910> part<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.450> i<00:00:13.290> rendered<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
this is the third part I i rendered the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.519 
this is the third part I i rendered the
fat<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:16.850> measured<00:00:17.850> i<00:00:18.119> measured<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.109> fat<00:00:19.320> with

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
fat and measured i measured the fat with

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.730 
fat and measured i measured the fat with
melted<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.189> from<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.240> i<00:00:21.810> together

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
melted that from that and i together

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
melted that from that and i together
with<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.640> lye<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:23.910> water<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.689> now<00:00:25.350> I've

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with the the lye and water and now I've

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.670 
with the the lye and water and now I've
been<00:00:25.830> mixing<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.490> high<00:00:26.760> speed

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.500 

it's<00:00:34.680> important<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.250> keep<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.760> moving<00:00:36.090> all

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's important to keep this moving all

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.320 
it's important to keep this moving all
the<00:00:36.660> time<00:00:36.740> and<00:00:37.740> I<00:00:38.160> also<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> keep<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> off

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
the time and I also want to keep it off

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.000 
the time and I also want to keep it off
the<00:00:39.360> side<00:00:41.090> moving<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.270> around<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.720> edge<00:00:43.010> if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the side moving it around the edge if

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
the side moving it around the edge if
you<00:00:44.160> thought<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.480> container<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:46.050> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you thought a container that's not but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
you thought a container that's not but
you<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.190> need<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> keep<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.790> all<00:00:47.940> moving

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you just need to keep it all moving

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
you just need to keep it all moving
because<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.530> happens<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.340> upon

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because what happens is it's upon

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.080 
because what happens is it's upon
applying<00:00:51.739> first<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.850> molecule

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
applying first the first of a molecule

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.650 
applying first the first of a molecule
chains<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:56.250> normal<00:00:56.699> feels<00:00:57.059> change<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
chains and then normal feels change and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.590 
chains and then normal feels change and
more<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.129> the<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.239> ones

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
more and more and more so the first ones

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
more and more and more so the first ones
have<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> change<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.860> rest<00:01:02.040> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have to change and then the rest and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.830 
have to change and then the rest and
follow<00:01:02.489> suit<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:05.120> you<00:01:06.120> wanted<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.810> sure

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
follow suit and you wanted to make sure

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.140 
follow suit and you wanted to make sure
all<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.680> changes<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.880> end<00:01:08.970> up

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
all the changes so that you don't end up

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.140 
all the changes so that you don't end up
with<00:01:09.360> law<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.050> bottom

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
with law on the bottom

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.899 
with law on the bottom
join

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.969 

so<00:01:17.450> now<00:01:17.600> see<00:01:17.899> how<00:01:17.990> thick<00:01:18.259> this<00:01:18.439> is<00:01:18.499> getting

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
so now see how thick this is getting

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.020 
so now see how thick this is getting
it's<00:01:19.130> getting<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.520> be<00:01:19.549> like<00:01:19.670> custard

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.000 

now<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:25.340> places<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.010> lie

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
now it's places when you can see it lie

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.660 
now it's places when you can see it lie
on<00:01:29.040> top<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.030> sink<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.660 

to<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:34.000> trying<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.479> add<00:01:34.689> some<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:36.490> flavoring

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to be trying to add some some flavoring

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:48.810 
to be trying to add some some flavoring
I<00:01:38.700> stuff<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.780> then

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.290 

now<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.270> faster<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.140> mix<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.790> faster

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
now the faster you mix it the faster

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.030 
now the faster you mix it the faster
it's<00:01:52.450> going<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.720> do<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.050> I've<00:01:53.350> been<00:01:53.650> mixing

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
it's going to do this I've been mixing

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.550 
it's going to do this I've been mixing
this<00:01:54.220> for<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.850> few<00:01:55.479> minutes<00:01:55.690> already<00:01:56.140> ten

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
this for a few minutes already ten

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
this for a few minutes already ten
minutes<00:01:56.920> maybe<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.430> 15

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.580 

see<00:02:04.200> how<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.530> changing

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 

one<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.920> those<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.399> delay<00:02:08.729> things<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.239> don't

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
one of those time delay things I don't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.020 
one of those time delay things I don't
know<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> edit

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.589 

so<00:02:15.030> let's<00:02:15.239> see<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.760> racing<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.940> not<00:02:18.090> let's

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
so let's see if it's racing or not let's

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.380 
so let's see if it's racing or not let's
see<00:02:18.930> what<00:02:22.459> it's<00:02:23.459> very<00:02:23.670> thick<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.510> i<00:02:26.390> don't

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
see what it's very thick but i don't

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
see what it's very thick but i don't
know<00:02:27.510> i<00:02:31.220> don't<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.760> quite<00:02:32.910> ready<00:02:33.209> for

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
know i don't think it's quite ready for

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.160 
know i don't think it's quite ready for
the<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:37.940> playroom<00:02:38.940> yeah<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.870> smelly

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the for the playroom yeah the smelly

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.890 
the for the playroom yeah the smelly
stuff<00:02:40.470> lets<00:02:40.709> us<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.069> code<00:02:43.129> well<00:02:44.129> its<00:02:44.310> turn

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
stuff lets us the code well its turn

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.360 
stuff lets us the code well its turn
thicken<00:02:45.900> right<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.410> edge<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.980> maybe<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
thicken right up on the edge so maybe it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.720 
thicken right up on the edge so maybe it
is<00:02:47.489> ready<00:02:49.130> but<00:02:50.130> that's<00:02:50.340> where<00:02:50.579> it's<00:02:50.700> really

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
is ready but that's where it's really

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.479 
is ready but that's where it's really
cool<00:02:51.180> maybe<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.140> not<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.590> ponified<00:02:53.010> maybe

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
cool maybe it's not so ponified maybe

00:02:53.489 --> 00:05:40.610 
cool maybe it's not so ponified maybe
it's<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.790> fat<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.450> separated<00:02:55.140> out

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:54.159 

I<00:05:48.320> don't<00:05:49.320> think<00:05:49.560> it's<00:05:49.710> tracing<00:05:50.190> enough<00:05:50.430> yet

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.730 

okay<00:05:55.169> I'll<00:05:55.410> let<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.740> know<00:05:55.770> when<00:05:55.979> it's<00:05:56.160> ready

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
okay I'll let you know when it's ready

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.490 
okay I'll let you know when it's ready
you<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.949> do<00:05:59.070> this<00:05:59.250> at<00:05:59.460> home
