00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
for it's ver

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
for it's ver
Atilla<00:02:15.470> t<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:16.910> see<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.920> gain

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
Atilla t you can see that the the gain

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.160 
Atilla t you can see that the the gain
switch<00:02:19.490> here<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.090> stepped<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:21.050> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
switch here it is stepped and if you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.920 
switch here it is stepped and if you
turn<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.470> down<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.800> zero<00:02:22.040> DB<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.690> use<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
turn it down to zero DB you can use it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.710 
turn it down to zero DB you can use it
as<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.080> line<00:02:24.320> level<00:02:24.500> input<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.490> I've<00:02:25.610> been<00:02:25.730> using

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
as a line level input so I've been using

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.350 
as a line level input so I've been using
it<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.050> run<00:02:27.200> some<00:02:27.350> tracks<00:02:27.620> through<00:02:27.860> as<00:02:27.980> well<00:02:28.360> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
it to run some tracks through as well to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000 
it to run some tracks through as well to
get<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> sound<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:29.990> transformer<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.890> as

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
get the sound of the transformer and as

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.340 
get the sound of the transformer and as
well<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> silk<00:02:31.700> button<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
what this silk button does and this pre

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.910 
what this silk button does and this pre
has<00:02:42.230> silk<00:02:42.530> red<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.650> silk

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
has silk red on it and they have silk

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.550 
has silk red on it and they have silk
red<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.370> silk<00:02:46.670> blue<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:47.900> has<00:02:48.080> silk<00:02:48.320> red

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
red and silk blue this one has silk red

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.790 
red and silk blue this one has silk red
and<00:02:48.830> what<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.459> silk<00:02:49.670> red<00:02:49.910> does<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.800> it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
and what the silk red does is it it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.710 
and what the silk red does is it it
emphasizes<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.270> mid<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.600> high

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
emphasizes the the mid and high

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.890 
emphasizes the the mid and high
frequencies<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.850> called<00:02:56.120> silk<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:56.750> to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
frequencies so it's called silk but to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.960 
frequencies so it's called silk but to
me<00:02:57.020> it's<00:02:57.200> more<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.650> byte<00:02:58.100> or<00:02:58.340> attitude<00:02:58.820> that

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
me it's more of a byte or attitude that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.580 
me it's more of a byte or attitude that
you<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.989> completely<00:03:00.410> different

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
you get and it's a completely different

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.770 
you get and it's a completely different
tone<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.280> right<00:03:02.120> now<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.360> hear<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.630> I'm

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
tone so right now you hear that I'm

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.370 
tone so right now you hear that I'm
talking<00:03:03.170> without<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.530> silk<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:06.230> is

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
talking without the silk and this is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.370 
talking without the silk and this is
with<00:03:06.560> me<00:03:06.770> with<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> silk<00:03:07.580> engaged<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:09.170> adds

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
with me with the silk engaged it adds

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.810 
with me with the silk engaged it adds
some<00:03:09.590> thickness<00:03:10.870> overall<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.820> really

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
some thickness overall to it and really

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.080 
some thickness overall to it and really
to<00:03:14.030> me<00:03:14.150> gives<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.510> some<00:03:14.989> attitude<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:17.000> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
to me gives it some attitude so just a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
to me gives it some attitude so just a
switch<00:03:17.270> back<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.510> forth<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.170> me<00:03:18.320> with
