00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.600 
our experience with the Dyken system has
put<00:00:19.330> us<00:00:19.450> in<00:00:19.599> the<00:00:19.689> position<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.259> really<00:00:21.130> liking

conscious<00:00:28.809> of<00:00:29.070> HVAC<00:00:30.070> systems<00:00:31.029> but<00:00:31.750> they

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
conscious of HVAC systems but they

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.709 
conscious of HVAC systems but they
really<00:00:32.649> like<00:00:33.219> what<00:00:33.579> they<00:00:33.880> see<00:00:33.940> in<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.329> Dyken

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
really like what they see in the Dyken

they're<00:00:38.050> not<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.530> liking<00:00:38.980> Dyken<00:00:39.430> they're

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
they're not just liking Dyken they're

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
they're not just liking Dyken they're
loving<00:00:40.150> Dyken<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:42.010> was<00:00:42.160> quiet<00:00:42.490> in<00:00:42.820> operation

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
loving Dyken it was quiet in operation

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.420 
loving Dyken it was quiet in operation
it<00:00:44.860> was<00:00:45.820> highly<00:00:46.420> energy<00:00:46.960> efficient<00:00:47.560> it<00:00:48.130> had

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
it was highly energy efficient it had

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.080 
it was highly energy efficient it had
low<00:00:48.820> maintenance<00:00:49.150> and<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:50.560> was<00:00:50.950> not<00:00:51.579> only<00:00:51.610> easy

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
to maintain it allowed a great deal of

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
to maintain it allowed a great deal of
flexibility<00:00:56.310> for<00:00:57.310> those<00:00:57.550> using<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.210> system

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
flexibility for those using the system

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.740 
flexibility for those using the system

one teacher in one classroom can feel
hot<00:01:05.710> enough<00:01:06.009> she<00:01:06.250> wants<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.579> put<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.119> system

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
hot enough she wants to put the system

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.190 
hot enough she wants to put the system
on<00:01:07.600> cooling<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.310> across<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.970> hallway<00:01:10.450> the

other<00:01:11.649> teacher<00:01:11.979> thinks<00:01:12.460> golly<00:01:12.819> it's<00:01:13.090> really

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
other teacher thinks golly it's really

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.389

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
flexibility to do that that reduces

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.709 
flexibility to do that that reduces
tremendously<00:01:18.429> the<00:01:18.670> number<00:01:18.969> of<00:01:19.030> complaints<00:01:19.389> we

they can't even hear what's going on
with<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.060> Dyken<00:01:25.450> system<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.079> that<00:01:26.380> quiet

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
with the Dyken system it's that quiet

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.849 
with the Dyken system it's that quiet
what<00:01:29.200> was<00:01:29.409> here<00:01:29.649> before<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.170> massive
