00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
could allow these plants to get much

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.600 
could allow these plants to get much
bigger<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:10.500> cut<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
bigger and I can cut them back and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.570 
bigger and I can cut them back and
they'll<00:00:11.759> regrow<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.509> they're<00:00:12.630> actually

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
they'll regrow and they're actually

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.310 
they'll regrow and they're actually
sending<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:15.260> suckers<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:17.240> they're

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
sending out suckers and they're

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.609 
sending out suckers and they're
wonderful<00:00:19.320> plant<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.359> though

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
wonderful plant as you see though

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.529 
wonderful plant as you see though
they're<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:23.310> top-heavy<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.180> system

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
they're little top-heavy for this system

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.009 
they're little top-heavy for this system
now<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> could<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.599> build<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.779> little

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
now I could go in and build a little

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
now I could go in and build a little
trellis<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.920> hold<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.109> honestly

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
trellis and hold them up but honestly

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
trellis and hold them up but honestly
that's<00:00:31.890> enough<00:00:32.250> basil<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> next<00:00:33.090> year

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
that's enough basil for the next year

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.190 
that's enough basil for the next year
for<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.750> there

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
I know it's wasteful I could have just

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
I know it's wasteful I could have just
replanted<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.900> cut<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.290> or

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
whatnot but really I have more than

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.390 
whatnot but really I have more than
enough<00:01:22.350> basil<00:01:24.320> there's<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.500> ten<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
weight on this in the freezer just

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
weight on this in the freezer just
freeze<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> do

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
is just freeze these flat and then I can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
is just freeze these flat and then I can
put<00:01:50.759> them<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.119> flat<00:01:51.479> freezer<00:01:51.840> bag<00:01:52.110> after

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
put them in a flat freezer bag after

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.999 
put them in a flat freezer bag after
that<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:54.200> we'll<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> look<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that and we'll see how they look in a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.060 
that and we'll see how they look in a
few<00:01:56.159> minutes<00:01:57.229> alright<00:01:58.229> while<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.710> leaves

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
few minutes alright while those leaves

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
few minutes alright while those leaves
are<00:01:59.420> hardening<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> freezer

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
are hardening up in the freezer

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.639 
are hardening up in the freezer
let's<00:02:02.219> take<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> peek<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.509> III<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.530> the

first time I've done this so I was
interested<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.940> seeing<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.319> tiny<00:02:10.560> lower

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
interested in seeing you see tiny lower

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.300 
interested in seeing you see tiny lower
roots<00:02:11.190> coming<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> side

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
roots coming out the side

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.070 
roots coming out the side
so<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.850> wanted<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.300> take<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> look<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> root

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
so I wanted to take a look at the root

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.220 
so I wanted to take a look at the root
system<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.450> my<00:02:16.600> first<00:02:16.840> time<00:02:16.990> seeing

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
system this is my first time seeing

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.530 
system this is my first time seeing
along<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.950> guys<00:02:21.270> that's<00:02:22.270> not<00:02:22.360> bad<00:02:22.720> huh

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
along with you guys that's not bad huh

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.190 
along with you guys that's not bad huh
not<00:02:25.540> bad<00:02:25.720> at<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.900> nice<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.440> cleaned<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:28.200> slight

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
not bad at all nice and cleaned a slight

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.140 
not bad at all nice and cleaned a slight
discoloration<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.550> think<00:02:30.760> that's<00:02:30.910> more<00:02:31.090> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
discoloration but I think that's more of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.620 
discoloration but I think that's more of
a<00:02:31.300> nutrient<00:02:31.810> thing<00:02:31.959> than<00:02:32.850> an<00:02:33.850> actual<00:02:34.209> bad

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
a nutrient thing than an actual bad

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.590 
a nutrient thing than an actual bad
thing<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:39.580> course<00:02:39.850> those<00:02:40.150> roots<00:02:40.450> were

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
thing of course those roots were

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.340 
thing of course those roots were
intertwined<00:02:40.989> with<00:02:41.319> these<00:02:41.470> roots<00:02:43.140> see<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> got

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
intertwined with these roots see I got

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.229 
intertwined with these roots see I got
plenty<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.860> nutrients<00:02:45.489> still<00:02:45.670> left<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.030> there

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
plenty of nutrients still left in there

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.360 
plenty of nutrients still left in there
I<00:02:46.390> actually<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.440> topped<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.860> off<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> few

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
I actually just topped this off a few

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.360 
I actually just topped this off a few
days<00:02:48.519> ago<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:50.200> okay<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.769> got<00:02:50.950> plenty<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
days ago so that's okay I got plenty of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.750 
days ago so that's okay I got plenty of
stuff<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.670> make<00:02:51.850> more<00:02:52.060> nutrient<00:02:52.510> with<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.310> if

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
stuff to make more nutrient with but if

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.690 
stuff to make more nutrient with but if
you're<00:02:57.910> ever<00:02:57.970> interested<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.930> need<00:02:59.110> some

longer you can actually tell it's one
big<00:03:09.160> tap<00:03:09.459> root<00:03:09.700> until<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.060> finds<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.450> water

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
big tap root until it finds the water

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.410 
big tap root until it finds the water
that<00:03:11.980> spreads<00:03:12.430> out<00:03:12.580> again<00:03:12.880> that's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
that spreads out again that's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.039

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
that's why I did the video so I could

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's why I did the video so I could
see<00:03:31.269> what<00:03:31.510> times<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.019> was<00:03:35.910> geez<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:38.950> that's<00:03:39.160> a

see what times it was geez now that's a
tap<00:03:39.549> root<00:03:39.790> huh<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:45.430> last<00:03:45.670> one<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:49.450> was<00:03:49.660> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
tap root huh the last one this was the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.830 
tap root huh the last one this was the
smallest<00:03:50.140> plant<00:03:50.560> for<00:03:51.190> some<00:03:51.370> reason<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.910> think

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
smallest plant for some reason I think

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.560 
smallest plant for some reason I think
it<00:03:53.019> was<00:03:53.109> just<00:03:53.410> stunted<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:55.090> definitely

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
it was just stunted is definitely
