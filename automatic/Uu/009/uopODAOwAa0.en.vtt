00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.400
 half the yard mile green 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.400
 true median 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.350
 there is no other word to write what 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.180
 happens is recording this episode that 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.180
 they are watching is recording 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.620
 in him 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 good what we do 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.809
 not serious and that was not badly done meat 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.890
 that I think the first necessary in that 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.220
 of 23 23 10 with the others in fact it was 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.220
 all right 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.530
 position 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 Amen 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.790
 one more 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.180
 predator player 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.180
 he is always a buyer 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.079
 with mark because the game passes 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.280
 to eggs 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.280
 then we have 15 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.960
 given when the arcade 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.960
 endurance 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.510
 when it's good, nothing could have 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.050
 hostel and then they did not bring anything else 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.760
 that two or a review of berger and four 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.720
 it really saved my ass really 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.220
 so 12 helicopters were missing and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.220
 looter the laptop 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.900
 the party was quickly what 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.530
 understood 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.780
 and all trains do other actions 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.130
 more and I think we all walk by 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.130
 I lived there I have I lived also 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.300
 again here because I'm going to see you at 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.300
 people totally again I'm going 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.410
 let him fail he had been wrong 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.410
 that nobody knew 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:29.190
 with very positive teams 18 15 16 18 14 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.700
 35 way good because this floor has been 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.700
 wanted 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.860
 by very short they were percent by 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.960
 moments with very good team and they 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:45.220
 I wanted to say this 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.220
 fast fast because you can not live 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.330
 that's why I recorded this because I can avoid 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.660
 upload another video 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.660
 then good 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.550

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.550
