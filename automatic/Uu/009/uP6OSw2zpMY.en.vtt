00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.070 
sides now these blocks right here you're
looking<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> 52<00:00:15.059> there's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> lot<00:00:15.990> of

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
looking at the 52 there's a lot of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
looking at the 52 there's a lot of
different<00:00:16.410> maneuvers<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.730> there's<00:00:18.000> not

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
different maneuvers you know there's not

different maneuvers you know there's not
52<00:00:19.279> separate<00:00:20.279> movement<00:00:20.760> over<00:00:21.060> certain

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.650 
52 separate movement over certain
louvers<00:00:21.750> repeat<00:00:22.080> themselves<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.800> like

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
louvers repeat themselves this is like

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
louvers repeat themselves this is like
they<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.289> came<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.859> thinking<00:00:26.220> about

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they when they came to thinking about

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
they when they came to thinking about
how<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> defend<00:00:26.970> against<00:00:27.330> punches<00:00:27.689> they

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
how to defend against punches they

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
how to defend against punches they
looked<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.590> many<00:00:28.740> ways<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.039> possible<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
looked at as many ways as possible so it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880 
looked at as many ways as possible so it
wasn't<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.320> stop<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> right

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
wasn't just one way to stop the right

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
wasn't just one way to stop the right
hand<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> stop<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> hook<00:00:33.630> may<00:00:33.840> have

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
hand one way to stop the hook may have

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
hand one way to stop the hook may have
three<00:00:34.469> different<00:00:34.860> looks<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> stop<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
three different looks on how to stop the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540 
three different looks on how to stop the
hook<00:00:36.030> how<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> stop<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.350> hand<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.190> we're

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
hook how to stop the right hand so we're

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.240 
hook how to stop the right hand so we're
gonna<00:00:38.640> take<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> look<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.270> Skull<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.840> Bones

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
gonna take a look at Skull and Bones

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
gonna take a look at Skull and Bones

closed or closed opens with these blocks

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
closed or closed opens with these blocks
right<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.610> wouldn't<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> break<00:00:45.120> down

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
right here wouldn't have to break down

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.000 
right here wouldn't have to break down
and<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> whole<00:00:46.200> system<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> fight

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and use the whole system in the fight

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
and use the whole system in the fight
I'm<00:00:47.520> saying<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:48.750> blocks

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
I'm saying you can just use these blocks

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm saying you can just use these blocks
medic<00:00:49.559> bag<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:50.129> most<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> be

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
medic bag as most people are going to be

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
medic bag as most people are going to be
throwing<00:00:51.210> haymakers<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.590> they're<00:00:52.739> boxers

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
throwing haymakers or if they're boxers

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.040 
throwing haymakers or if they're boxers
they'll<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.489> straight<00:00:53.820> punches<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> these

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
they'll have straight punches and these

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.779 
they'll have straight punches and these
blocks<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.710> pretty<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:55.949> cover<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
blocks will pretty much cover the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.020 
blocks will pretty much cover the
haymakers<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> straight<00:00:59.579> punches<00:00:59.910> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
haymakers or the straight punches so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
haymakers or the straight punches so
first<00:01:00.300> we'll<00:01:00.809> take<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> look<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.609> dealing<00:01:02.609> with

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
first we'll take a look at dealing with

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
first we'll take a look at dealing with
the<00:01:02.789> haymakers<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.629> facing<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> haymaker

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the haymakers you're facing the haymaker

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
the haymakers you're facing the haymaker
the<00:01:04.500> block<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.400> thinking

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the block you should really be thinking

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:19.910 
the block you should really be thinking
about<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.119> closed<00:01:06.510> door<00:01:06.810> inside

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 

so<00:01:20.580> dealing<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> haymakers<00:01:22.170> those<00:01:22.710> are

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so dealing with the haymakers those are

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
so dealing with the haymakers those are
like<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> easiest<00:01:23.400> punches<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.940> want<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
like the easiest punches you want to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.540 
like the easiest punches you want to
have<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.450> problems<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.350> someone<00:01:25.770> throwing

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
have more problems with someone throwing

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:39.530 
have more problems with someone throwing
left<00:01:27.270> hook<00:01:27.510> open

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.900 

those<00:01:40.080> punches<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
those punches because they have more

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.000 
those punches because they have more
leverage<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.050> have<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> moving

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
leverage in them you have to be moving

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.470 
leverage in them you have to be moving
you<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> stand<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.910> he's<00:01:45.270> done

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480

what happened to you
that<00:01:50.409> big<00:01:50.590> left<00:01:50.830> hook<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.280> step<00:01:52.030> with<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.360> is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
that big left hook I step with it is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.350 
that big left hook I step with it is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
let's take some of the pressure away and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.060 
let's take some of the pressure away and
it<00:01:56.720> reads<00:01:57.020> open<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:57.830> what

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.280 

Mediate

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560

so now looking at skullenbones
skullenbones<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.619> help<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
skullenbones can help me with the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
skullenbones can help me with the
straight<00:02:08.459> punches<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.270> dealing
