00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:11.360
 Hey everyone, it 's nothing, there's nothing. 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:15.639
 bad getting there early in the morning functional 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.639
 and functional car and he did not pick up on it 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.210
 Head in the match here from volvo here already 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.480
 had been feeling this week and that he 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.429
 it was bad to help from there 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:35.930
 Taking a little while to get there, let's see 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:39.559
 here the voltage of the battery is 21.2 volts 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 here does not work at all since 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.440
 I looked here with the partners who 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.390
 had ended here 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.030
 And this car here is full of things to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.930
 to work if you take the battery it 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.840
 short 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.879
 he turns off the engine I will not give a tip 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.559
 here for you here the first 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.820
 thing identify the battery is 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.940
 problem 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.060
 I do not advise anyone to do that, right? 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.790
 but since I do not have a test and also 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.930
 It's dangerous to do once you 're done. 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.640
 blow up a battery not even think 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:28.220
 did not take my face but let's go yes 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:31.990
 This has load, the problem is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.460
 from here we will do a procedure here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.710
 basic 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.720
 I do not have a pacifier car already 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.260
 He went after you think the consul is here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.910
 to do something fast here 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.050
 come and connect this battery here 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.400
 Hyundai hr switches on that battery 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.400
 Let's put it here to load it. 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.770
 on here 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.360
 It was never our Czech foot making 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 giving a tip that paying was here with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.500

 negative with negative today 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.150
 because most people know that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.200
 but this is a tip that already has 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.470
 many people also do not know what the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.470
 scheme 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:31.300

 already worked in 15 minutes to be able to 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:53.270
 charge the battery here reach the voltage 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:59.660
 normal from negative to negative and 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:04.630
