many different ways we're going to try
one<00:00:17.670> fire<00:00:17.940> trick<00:00:18.210> right<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.539> we're<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.750> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
one fire trick right now we're going to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.269 
one fire trick right now we're going to
share<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.109> with<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.920> our<00:00:20.039> camera

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
share it with you we have our camera

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
share it with you we have our camera
pointed<00:00:20.970> down<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.539> we're<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.869> be

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
pointed down so we're going to be

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.080 
pointed down so we're going to be
working<00:00:22.170> flat<00:00:22.680> against<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> table<00:00:23.970> here

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
working flat against this table here

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300 
working flat against this table here
that's<00:00:24.240> covered<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.539> black<00:00:24.810> paper<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.410> what

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that's covered with black paper and what

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.500 
that's covered with black paper and what
we<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.269> paper<00:00:27.960> cutouts<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:31.399> flames<00:00:32.510> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
we have our paper cutouts of flames we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
we have our paper cutouts of flames we
have<00:00:33.600> three<00:00:33.809> different<00:00:33.930> colors<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> paper<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
have three different colors of paper and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.000 
have three different colors of paper and
then<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.600> cutout<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.010> gel

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
then in the back we have a cutout of gel

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
then in the back we have a cutout of gel
it's<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.579> orange<00:00:38.879> lighting<00:00:39.180> gel<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:40.140> acetate

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it's an orange lighting gel or acetate

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
it's an orange lighting gel or acetate
which<00:00:41.129> gives<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> nice<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> little

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
which gives it a nice kind of little

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
which gives it a nice kind of little
shine<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.070> sometimes<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.430> only

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
shine to it sometimes you can use only

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
shine to it sometimes you can use only
paper<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.390> only<00:00:45.570> gel<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> three

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
paper or only gel and do it three

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.639 
paper or only gel and do it three
dimensional<00:00:47.570> some<00:00:48.570> people<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.899> wax<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
dimensional some people use wax and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
dimensional some people use wax and
light<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.250> within<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.300> fire<00:00:51.510> trick

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
light it from within but this fire trick

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.209 
light it from within but this fire trick
is<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.350> simple<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.770> something<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
is very very simple as something you can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
is very very simple as something you can
try<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.489> home<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.110> we'll<00:00:55.110> show<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
try at home and we'll show you how it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
try at home and we'll show you how it
works<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> our<00:00:56.820> fire

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
works right now we have our fire

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.170 
works right now we have our fire
positioned<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.289> under<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> camera<00:00:59.550> right

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
positioned just under the camera right

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.340 
positioned just under the camera right
in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> center<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:00.840> we're<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
in the center there we're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
in the center there we're going to
feature<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> fire<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.609> animation<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
feature the fire in this animation and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.160 
feature the fire in this animation and
we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.260> our<00:01:04.379> fire<00:01:04.589> position<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we have our fire position just so and I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
we have our fire position just so and I
will<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.220> picture<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.130> we're<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
will take a picture and we're going to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.109 
will take a picture and we're going to
take<00:01:12.020> another<00:01:13.020> set<00:01:13.549> we're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> move<00:01:14.939> our

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
take another set we're going to move our

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070 
take another set we're going to move our
first<00:01:15.450> fire<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.880> match<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.330> second

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
first fire out and match up our second

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.060 
first fire out and match up our second
fire<00:01:20.540> does<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.560> perfectly

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fire does not have to be perfectly

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
fire does not have to be perfectly
matched<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.200> it's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> different

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
matched up and because it's a different

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
matched up and because it's a different
cut<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.189> won't<00:01:26.310> perfectly<00:01:26.850> match<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
cut out it won't perfectly match up you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840 
cut out it won't perfectly match up you
want<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> slightly<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.670> your

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
want that slightly off look in your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.050 
want that slightly off look in your
overlay<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.140> take<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.350> next<00:01:31.740> picture

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
overlay and you take your next picture

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
overlay and you take your next picture
we'll<00:01:33.060> move<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.750> fire<00:01:34.259> set<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
we'll move that fire set up out of the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
we'll move that fire set up out of the
way<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.790> we'll<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.600> into<00:01:36.780> our<00:01:36.900> third<00:01:37.320> fire<00:01:37.619> set

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
way and we'll go into our third fire set

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
way and we'll go into our third fire set
up<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:39.380> placing<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:41.390> without<00:01:42.390> necessarily

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
up again placing it without necessarily

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.649 
up again placing it without necessarily
matching<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.740> easily<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.479> because<00:01:45.479> they're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
matching it easily up because they're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
matching it easily up because they're
different<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> picture<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:48.619> we'll<00:01:49.619> go

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
different like that picture and we'll go

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.130 
different like that picture and we'll go
back<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.310> our<00:01:51.090> first<00:01:51.299> fire<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.189> we'll

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
back to our first fire and we'll

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:10.630 
back to our first fire and we'll
uh<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.130> there<00:01:56.890> picture<00:02:06.430> picture<00:02:09.640> third

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
uh in there picture picture third

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.000 
uh in there picture picture third
fire<00:02:11.120> now<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:13.180> could<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:14.750> day<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.350> love

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
fire now I could do this all day I love

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.470 
fire now I could do this all day I love
it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.420 
it
but<00:02:17.480> we're<00:02:18.110> going<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.440> cheat<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:18.980> bit<00:02:19.130> in

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
but we're going to cheat a little bit in

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.760
