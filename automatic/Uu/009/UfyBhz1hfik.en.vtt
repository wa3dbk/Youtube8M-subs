00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we are making cakes see we are going to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.850
 make three five-storey pies these 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.050
 are the three above the important thing 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.820
 this video is not to see how they have been made 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.340
 these pies that as you can see have a lot 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.339
 there without this is there is no white and this is 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 there are no roses are sponge cakes that are 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:23.789
 double positions then we have 25 of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.669
 20 and of 15 and then we have one of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.409
 thirty-one of 35 all that you 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.109
 we want to teach today is how we ride 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.769
 the cupcakes leaving a bit of air 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.660
 among them how do we structure 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.809
 well let's see how we are doing 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.149
 to hold is the first three with the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.399
 second and the second with the third 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.200
 what we do is cut we see 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.140
 a disc that is 25 centimeters 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.470
 and on a cork base that has two 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.540
 centimeters we cut then we have 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.940
 marked and now with our cutter 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.160
 cork we are going to cut the penalty is that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.210
 we do not have this base of 25 but 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 we would trim anything 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.750
 Well, that's it, we've already 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.909
 we cut now what we will do will be 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.580
 put it on our cake for it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.330
 we need a disk to put in front 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.240
 and another to put below we paste our 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.950
 cork disc with white tail because 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990
 we put a disc on one side and another 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.509
 disc on the other because that's when 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.119
 put the straws on the cake to 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.979
 that holds this down the cork is 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.770
 say that the straw does not cross the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.950
 good cork as we apply white glue 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.920
 and we put the disc and on the other side 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.460
 just as good now around our 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 cork sandwich we put a loop and what 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.979
 We are putting a tie pins against 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.840
 cork good because this is the floor of 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.899
 down our cake this floor down 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.300
 is 35 in diameter then now 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.429
 we put one of the sandwiches that we have 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.310
 prepared you have 35 and our 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.159
 sandwich has 25 because we do not want that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.929
 look so close or we want that 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.509
 when we assemble we have a piece of 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.800
 separation before putting the sandwich 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.390
 We have put many straws 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.890
 because we have put a lot of good 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.290
 because this cake is not really going to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 eat us lampe i pay an ad they have 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.210
 that in the end the cake falls and that's why 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 It has real cake but as not 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.720
 we want problems we have put 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.570
 enough straws to hold 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.030
 while it rolls well then 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.830
 now what we do is this album what 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.890
 we stick as we always do to our 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.140
 surface with a little wet fondant 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.550
 with water and pex we will put that another little 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.550
 of fondant to paste the above 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.770
 well now we have already assembled the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 next you see now we do the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.090
 same operation you see that there is still air 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.220
 man the ideal would be that still 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.110
 there was more air and you could not see what 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.240
 from the center but that confers 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.220
 instability can be done but not 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.650
 It's really worth it, everyone in this 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.890
 mess well then now we assemble the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.250
 above 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.290
 for that we take the other sandwich what 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.189
 we put 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.079
 and we put up the other good then 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.900
 now we have put again our 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.689
 cork sandwich and we're going to assemble the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.819
 last three floors we assembled here 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.829
 over we do the same thing we put a little 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.159
 of fondant trade with water and hala for 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.579
 up good then look we want to ride 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.590
 one we have mounted another and now the three 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.950
 last say the cake goes like this with five 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.950
 floors 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.870
 and in both these basses then with a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.870
 little air 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.239
 we could have placed higher the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.519
 part of our sandwiches and here 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.230
 we could put flowers and you are or what 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.420
 but in this case they wanted it that way with 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.500
 a separation of about two centimeters 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.500
 that because we have done
