looking<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.380> iOS<00:00:37.890> lately<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.030> blunt

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
looking a lot like iOS lately the blunt

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
looking a lot like iOS lately the blunt
answer<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> waste<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.160> time

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
answer was that it was a waste of time

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
answer was that it was a waste of time
and<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> waste<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> power<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.140> merge

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and a waste of power for them to merge

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
and a waste of power for them to merge
both<00:00:43.829> operating<00:00:44.370> systems<00:00:44.850> meaning<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
both operating systems meaning that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
both operating systems meaning that
apparently<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.289> won't<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.739> getting<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.280> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
apparently we won't be getting this but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
apparently we won't be getting this but
that<00:00:48.090> being<00:00:48.329> said<00:00:48.420> think<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> iOS<00:00:49.620> 7<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that being said think about it iOS 7 is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
that being said think about it iOS 7 is
a<00:00:50.039> new<00:00:50.190> deal<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.789> still<00:00:51.000> based<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a new deal but it's still based on the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
a new deal but it's still based on the
same<00:00:51.809> thing<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> OS<00:00:52.739> 10<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> pretty<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.579> 10

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
same thing and OS 10 is pretty much 10

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
same thing and OS 10 is pretty much 10
years<00:00:54.030> old<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.600> given<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> fact<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> there

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
years old so given the fact that there

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.180 
years old so given the fact that there
is<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.809> OS<00:00:58.079> 11<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
is a need for an OS 11 and a lot of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
is a need for an OS 11 and a lot of
patents<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.850> there<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
patents out there it could just be that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.510 
patents out there it could just be that
they're<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.440> merging<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.370> could

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
they're not merging them they could

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.709 
they're not merging them they could
probably<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.090> working<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.480> something

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

photographs that came from a video and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.210

since we don't really consider this
video<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.880> real<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.780> kind<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.229> hard<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
video to be real it's kind of hard to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
video to be real it's kind of hard to
know<00:01:52.920> exactly<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.390> dummy

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
know exactly if this is not just a dummy

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690 
know exactly if this is not just a dummy
or<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> phone<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.130> got<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> back

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
or just the phone that got it back

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
or just the phone that got it back
coloring<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.479> something<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.170> many<00:01:58.320> options

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
coloring or something so many options

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
coloring or something so many options
are<00:01:58.979> available<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.729> again<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.420> are

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
are available but then again we are

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
are available but then again we are
wishing<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> true<00:02:02.189> even<00:02:02.219> though

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
wishing that this is true even though

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
wishing that this is true even though
apparently<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.240> leaks<00:02:03.450> say<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.049> we

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
apparently the leaks say that we

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.990 
apparently the leaks say that we
wouldn't<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.950> getting<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.340> phone<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.790> color
