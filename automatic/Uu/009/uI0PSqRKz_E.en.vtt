 young guests of the channel marco I have spoken very little here and I wanted to 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.740
 talk inside about the future so don't complain about the future 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.440
 van gaal 2030 for, among other things, about the future if I do know the past 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 done with the future all years ago online broker 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.820
 try to say is that the perpetrators pick up 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.070
 the share is silent now bayern munich has been silent for two weeks 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.240
 what happens now what happened did that also for the future of the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.720
 first time wondering why we want to watch the ball that ever run 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.500
 through life i sure the channel no porn and i think that is certain 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.400
 period of barroso today it must be because it is about that I am 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.610
 pulled his shirt and played it in most markets 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.120

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.420
 say 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.079
 what makes that come early 2015 this channel online in a few weeks I go to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.870
 paris and cologne and there make videos of all vacations about opportunities 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.530
 according to this channel come second question that i have hakerig for that 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.420
 best direction is close 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.170
 Taliban you can say that I was a beautiful woman but joined two years ago 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.640
 started as part of the media to replicate where potential computer becomes 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.579
 this could make that is 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.389
 much less work than a thick book or even solar panels moritz unfortunately it is like that 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.599
 that we freeze the twenty videos a week to park therefore we want one 

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.520
 big march that just doesn't go what everyone has their own life and if 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.969
 you twice when i'm not in the place you want to be with, even if it's whole 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.649
 difficult but you have to say let boys take a rest ede one 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.090
 kick thinking with everything we want to do and in my case that is similar to arjen 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.400
 seals 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.730
 Logically that's something I really want to leave just the last few years 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.600
 three months 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 that I have to play all the time distracted from banks, of course we started 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.930
 I also had a girlfriend, however, completely in love ndp everything 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.140
 each other no longer decently that day after the Volkskrant also once again 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.670
 the us was able to travel to hilversum every week on the spot to do a program there 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.259
 and then of course makes a lot of bnr friends and love and her 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.149
 girlfriends who all members things from Veendam at the time winner 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.119
 televizier ring gala ruben van der meer I sometimes get along and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.350
 that's how it all happens inside, so that idiot are distracted 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.930
 from parking fines I think I actually since 2011 2012 because that 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.819
 Afternoon too focused on order laboriously there I am terribly upset about the bar and 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.330
 is angry of who I am and where I have I have become what I want to put through and 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.919
 then all 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.730
 there are of the second pole while they still for their meat on the internet because me 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.379
 deeply other youtube visited by the employers wanted to do it with this too 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.679
 according to so much relapse yes I do not look Dutch boys boys earlier 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.240
 well looked bayern won is just a shame 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.459
 that he is changing is that he will be gone 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.780
 that that obama it so good so terrible that i am no idea 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.819
 where I really am someone who wants to sit in front of the camera like dr 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.159
 lean back and have had a good time doing it, but I understand 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.539
 it is that people think that bayern munich is also a dead death and never 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.969
 more will come back the difference so that i used to always make videos with my 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.079
 friends must be in order I found the last sketch 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.340
 it is a very strange atmosphere from 2009 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.020
 if you then have the ultimate creativity in which three years it 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.949
 strongest where anything can happen 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.409
 then that is also this crazier sweden this sketch of the essense of the building 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.409
 it is really a future plan 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.319
 10 how are you going to do that 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.089
 b 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.419
 it's not either 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.979
 I stare 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.979
 spread yes is also possible 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 let the management of gordon 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.809
 9 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:34.949
 novum 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.989
 but I did not expect anything from the future 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.189
 something like that 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.189
 the that is a dome 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.640
 acv has syria the doctor 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.509
 science 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.509
 one I do not have 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.279
 that is again a big number I wanted to know 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.199
 Article 3 years and I see that is doing something else is back to Albert 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.209
 park nothing at all 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.280
 something that almost only continues to work out to show itself here 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.820
 never on the ps3 I am one hundred percent sure that I should continue with Bayern 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.010
 Munich and I am even 200 percent convinced that Bayern hobbies 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.139
 then I go outside ever only only of course better then 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.430
 used to be because otherwise this is very well mounted and that means that I am in 

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:43.669
 the viewer porch for no chance for bordeaux this channel the tranquility 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.400
 but for the people who are wondering how is it, then stop when GM 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.150
 both parties moody 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.740
 it is actually very simple i will bayern movies 50 percent chance of success 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.889
 to give the package to tim cook a 50 percent chance of success but that 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.820
 That means if I already have a couple of guys so that I have a 50 percent chance of it 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.180
 succeed if I lose everything 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.500
 going to do projects yes then my chances are half 50 percent twice 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.310
 chances about the couple that bayern officially exists to the campaign then 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.969
 less and there it goes so scared that the campaign must be a lot less 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.169
 the fact that it is something we have had non-stop over the past two years 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.899
 Perhaps he has experienced with yourself Japan that can prove the first 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.659
 six really four much better and want to make new videos for true 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.729
 your moody's wife 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.639
 I've been working on some kind of wikileaks Ferrari has the new one 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.449
 party a lot of this is really a very big cut I don't go there much yet 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.569
 keep an eye on things later than expected, but you can also see that time is up 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.520
 also with him it is a very strange story this video will be released at the end of August on arjen 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.490
 must be there in the meantime I want below 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.110
 a nice radio flavor company crooks that are just as good and that's it 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.600
 last thing I want to give is something very nice because you always have to 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.060
 Any criticism you read will certainly be awkward according to Bordeaux's other 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.219
 four o'clock 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.300
 you can convert all that criticism into two things you can be that are persie 

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:00.229
 can't say 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.060
 I get you this I get angry with Hooijdonk jargon that at an outbuilding time of 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:09.210
 Spain won the tournament precursors to his bed in that are not right 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.189

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.370
 Robben I worked criticism after a fight it is no benefit if you occasionally 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.380
 get a confirmation so I got laughed veronica magazine flour products 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.060
