00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.550
 Hey, people , tv show numbers. 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.950
 today I brought a technique to the hand 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.839
 right for you and in the video lesson 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.840
 today I'm using string 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.720
 nylon for guitar laws 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.449
 the technique consists of a sim movement 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.900
 guilty or is it a movement where there is 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.949
 an ok rhythm shift made by the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.410
 thumb 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.530
 this rhythm it characterizes very well the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.080
 be in the form of fingering or 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.640
 either in the form of melody and the neighborhood 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.660
 following up 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.460
 I'll show you some examples here ok 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 a very famous example is the wing 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.700
 white 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 I'll slow down and you'll follow 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 the thumb it will work in the same 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 line of the bomb or in this way 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.680
 what happens 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.710
 this cell we call 5 pi 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.170
 works the way I have the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 sound in strong weather that is the first 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:42.990
 time and at the end of that time ok 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:46.930
 so I have a displacement 12 moon 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.510
 212 in the second part of the time I do not 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.150
 I have a rope attack I still have 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.720
 just an ok but I have no attack 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.300
 on the note then that shift is okay 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.610
 a good exercise for us to observe 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.210
 this movement and learn how 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.300
 does 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.720
 syncope is doing it here look at the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.840
 indicator and the average they will do 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:16.209
 sixteenth note is like making 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:20.410
 four notes per time 12 341 in 34 or 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.430
 34 and the thumb will work on the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 time one 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:35.480
 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.560
 The second part has no thumb. Come on. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.880
 again 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:53.740
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.740
 for 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.730
 so you can tell that 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.510
 It's okay, then, I 'm not. 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.640
 doing four times I split the aao 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.820
 time in four parts and went counting 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.340
 so in the first part I have thumb 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.370
 and let sustained in the next 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.010
 next three parties in the fourth part 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.800
 is the last twelfth and attacked him 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.580
 new thumb and then I only make indicator 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.580
 it's medium, it's okay 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.170
 we have other ways to use 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.370
 this rhythm, several songs, give us guys 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 use ours in our repertoire 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.210
 mainly to make introductions 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
 that song annunciation of alceu 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.420
 also we can make the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.420
 introducing SO 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.920
 both the white house and this song 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.069
 announcing the bottom will not go 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:28.500
 use a sixteenth and a full fill that is 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:29.860
 thus 1 and 2 and 11 and 2 and bull and 2 and with 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:37.630
 United 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:39.370
 o and 2 and 1 and 2 and 2 and attached to the alceu 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 valencia 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:56.650
 1 and 12 1 pe 2 and 1 and 2 and 12 12 and kong 2 and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:59.590
 together and in 12 to work with the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.930
 Eighth note that it 's half the time I go 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.150
 show you guys on a rope only 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.270
 As I have done with four notes per time. 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.330
 for you to make the observation of how it goes 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.800
 being this displaced movement is then 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.800
 slowly 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:33.939
 1 and 21 11 and 21 of 2 and now it 's just us 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:38.489
 join the songs with the bass 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.489
 alternating starting with the white house 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.619
 the docile balance 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.660
 so this is it folks 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.660
 good studies and until the next
