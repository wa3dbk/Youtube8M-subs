differently<00:00:44.660> let's<00:00:45.660> check<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.790> this<00:00:47.790> mod

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
differently let's check it out this mod

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.780 
differently let's check it out this mod
I'm<00:00:48.330> showing<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.980> will<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.250> crucial<00:00:50.580> for

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
I'm showing you will be crucial for

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.970 
I'm showing you will be crucial for
Gaugamela<00:00:52.010> if<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.280> mod<00:00:53.550> did<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.180> exist<00:00:54.980> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
Gaugamela if this mod did not exist that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.670 
Gaugamela if this mod did not exist that
battle<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.489> never<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.910> done<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:59.239> just

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
battle would never get done so I just

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
battle would never get done so I just
ripped<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> audio<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> movie<00:01:02.970> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
ripped the audio from the movie and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
ripped the audio from the movie and
split<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> 20<00:01:05.100> different<00:01:05.519> parts

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
split it up into like 20 different parts

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.720 
split it up into like 20 different parts
so<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
so it's going to be they take about a

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.390 
so it's going to be they take about a
month<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> done<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.560> assure<00:01:11.370> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

month to get it done but I assure you
it's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.730> to<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.909> pretty<00:01:12.060> sweet<00:01:13.280> we're<00:01:14.280> not

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.410 

what<00:01:57.610> happens<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:57.970> run<00:01:58.180> through<00:01:58.210> the

moving<00:02:05.830> fast<00:02:06.160> okay<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:06.790> guess<00:02:07.000> we<00:02:07.120> can't<00:02:07.500> that's

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
moving fast okay I guess we can't that's

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.720 
moving fast okay I guess we can't that's
good

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.790 

take<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.790> look<00:02:12.940> at<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> Royal<00:02:13.600> Spartans<00:02:13.990> look

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.310 
take a look at the Royal Spartans look
at<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.100> phalanx<00:02:15.700> valve<00:02:16.300> that's<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.900> phalanx

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
at that phalanx valve that's a phalanx

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.720 
at that phalanx valve that's a phalanx
fellas<00:02:17.910> look<00:02:18.910> how<00:02:19.030> tight<00:02:19.420> those<00:02:19.630> Spears<00:02:19.960> are

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
look how close they are together now I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.300 
look how close they are together now I
understand<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:26.170> didn't<00:02:26.410> hold<00:02:26.590> their<00:02:26.830> shield

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
understand they didn't hold their shield

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.830 
understand they didn't hold their shield
like<00:02:27.520> this<00:02:28.740> arm<00:02:29.740> strap<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> their<00:02:30.640> arm<00:02:30.850> but

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
like this arm strap to their arm but

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.480 
like this arm strap to their arm but
this<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.350> best<00:02:32.530> phalanx<00:02:33.040> you've<00:02:33.250> ever

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
this is the best phalanx you've ever

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.400 
this is the best phalanx you've ever
seen<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.800> um<00:02:37.140> my<00:02:38.140> next<00:02:38.370> comparison<00:02:39.370> will<00:02:39.550> be<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
seen so um my next comparison will be a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.770 
seen so um my next comparison will be a
phalanx<00:02:41.410> versus<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> Roman<00:02:42.640> infantry<00:02:42.880> but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
phalanx versus a Roman infantry but

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
phalanx versus a Roman infantry but

let's see how these these guys fight

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.449 
let's see how these these guys fight
each<00:02:45.850> other<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:52.830> I'm<00:02:53.830> gonna<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.100> gonna<00:02:54.160> skip

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
each other but I'm gonna I'm gonna skip

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.770 
each other but I'm gonna I'm gonna skip
ahead<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.570> guys<00:02:55.810> don't<00:02:55.989> have<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:57.720> watch<00:02:58.720> me

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
ahead so you guys don't have to watch me

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.300 
ahead so you guys don't have to watch me
walk<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.410> right<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.370> put<00:03:00.760> them<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.030> Phalanx

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
walk all right I put them in the Phalanx

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.290 
walk all right I put them in the Phalanx
trying<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.459> them<00:03:03.580> into<00:03:03.850> pike<00:03:04.390> mood<00:03:06.300> you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
trying to get them into pike mood you

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:28.520 
trying to get them into pike mood you
see<00:03:07.480> how<00:03:07.630> different<00:03:07.900> they<00:03:08.170> are<00:03:08.200> here

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500 

now<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.430> didn't<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.850> these<00:03:29.970> guys<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
now if you didn't have these guys in the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.610 
now if you didn't have these guys in the
pike<00:03:30.690> mode<00:03:30.960> they<00:03:31.740> will<00:03:31.920> use<00:03:32.130> their<00:03:32.280> swords

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
pike mode they will use their swords

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.270 
pike mode they will use their swords
when<00:03:34.620> they<00:03:34.710> do<00:03:34.770> fight<00:03:39.200> now<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:41.100> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
when they do fight now I do think that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.760 
when they do fight now I do think that
they<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.910> move<00:03:42.240> forward<00:03:42.300> in<00:03:42.840> phalanx<00:03:43.530> without

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
they can move forward in phalanx without

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.980 
they can move forward in phalanx without
breaking<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.390> because<00:03:45.390> they<00:03:45.510> are<00:03:45.690> pretty<00:03:45.930> much

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
breaking it because they are pretty much

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.040 
breaking it because they are pretty much
a<00:03:46.080> pike<00:03:46.350> unit<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.320> way<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.540> doesn't<00:03:51.959> look

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
a pike unit in a way but it doesn't look

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.270 
a pike unit in a way but it doesn't look
like<00:03:52.230> these<00:03:52.410> guys<00:03:52.620> are<00:03:52.830> doing<00:03:53.100> much<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
like these guys are doing much of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:07.240 
like these guys are doing much of
anything<00:03:55.700> you've<00:03:56.700> lost<00:03:56.940> one<00:03:57.480> man
