00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello very good guys 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.070
 in the beginning now I was going to record the 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.200
 magic lantern videos and let's see the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.510
 menu and all this but 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.120
 this friend 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.570
 It has left me or be my hard drive 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.840
 laptop has broken down and I'm going to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.480
 bring a new one next week for 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.850
 which I do not have a chance to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.370
 edit the videos and put the screenshots 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.800
 of the camera's screen 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.610
 I have decided to record other types of videos 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.969
 that you do not need to edit them then 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.780
 what are we going to talk about, I've seen that 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:51.420
 the channel because there are people who are dedicated to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.420
 photographing events or weddings 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.480
 something of that type then then some 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.660
 they have asked themselves questions about how 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.020
 I work as babies and what is vital and I have 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.930
 decided to record some videos then about 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.120
 this not about my workflow and in 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.150
 I want to explain this first video 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.520
 what is my strategy before knowing 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.630
 the client because that's where he starts 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.710
 really good communication because I 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 I have done everything possible so that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.550
 when a client 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 potential client or a person who 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.620
 same is not my client yet but 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 come into my web page done everything 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.890
 possible for this person to see 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.770
 clearly what is what I'm doing 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 why I do it and how do I do it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.410
 so there I have prices there are a lot 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.250
 people who do not put prices are worth but I 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.770
 I set prices I put as work I put 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 example photos is worth and I put data from 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.590
 contact what I intend is with this is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.630
 get that when you contact me 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 someone 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 Looking for a photographer for your event 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.679
 for your wedding normally so what I 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.819
 I want is that this person when 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.780
 contact me now 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.770
 know how 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.740
 As a job I do not know what kind 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.050
 of photos I do how many hours I work 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.200
 how much do I charge and all that then? 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 when they contact me already more or less 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 they have decided that I am the best 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.700
 photographer for your case for your wedding not and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.610
 do not just contact me for 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.310
 ask me how many budget 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.950
 hours I stay at work now 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.650
 I start that now I finish and maybe not 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.610
 I have everything very well specified in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.520
 my website 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.920
 and if someone sees something that is not like him 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840
 he wants so simply do not contact 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.130
 with me because I'm not the person 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.850
 right for him and if someone sees how 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.520
 work and it seems fine not because 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.950
 contact with me and then practically 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.720
 it's my client what we have to talk about 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.110
 is 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.120
 of the details 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.000
 and that 's the way I communicate 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.010
 with my clients even before 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.910
 meet us I think it's a very good 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.310
 so that there is no contingency for 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.650
 do not waste time with people who 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.330
 asks questions and then I answer 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.490
 because the next one is going to be the same 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.620
 questions and I will have to answer you from the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.640
 same way then why not put it 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.459
 on my website because I do not put that live 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.140
 in burgos and if elaborated is more than 80 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.150
 kilometers of burgos I have to charge 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.790
 travel expenses and if it is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.300
 Less than 80 km is free 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.470
 I put this on my website and the person already 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.980
 he knows he does not have to ask me 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.110
 how many photos do I make at an event also 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.150
 it says that I have three prices 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.780
 price packs that adapt to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.540
 any taste at any price 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.709
 to any budget sorry and this 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.920
 way so I get that probably 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.530
 fewer people contacted the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.800
 how much contact would they write to me 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.400
 if I do not put this data but what 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.070
 It makes sense if I say it because 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.900
 it will suit them for example if someone from 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.730
 from málaga found my website and does not know 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.100
 I live in Burgos as you like 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.910
 it will be quite expensive to pay me the expenses 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.710
 of displacements to málaga and the 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.480
 hotel to stay to sleep there because 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.540
 I can not drive myself a few hours 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.270
 do the wedding and come back or it is a 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.700
 madness, but there are people who do not 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.400
 it matters that what they fix is ​​the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.300
 quality and style of photographs and 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.300
 they like it fits with the taste they have 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.810
 and then it's there we pay for the trip 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.860
 we pay everything hired not then 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.659
 that way of communicating with customers 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.050
 before meeting you in the next 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.690
 video let's talk about how it is 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.520
 what I do when we already have a dialogue 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.720
 when we arrived we wrote a little 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.190
 I normally use the email not 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.780
 I use a lot of phone although I have it 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.970
 but they do not call me and I prefer that 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.000
 do not call me I prefer everything to be for 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.160
 email 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.200
 in the next video we will see how 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.070
 communicate with them and what is it 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.230
 we do before the event really worth 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.660
 see you in the next video I hope 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.030

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.650

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.290

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.870
 up in the search engine and that's because of me 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.760
