00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.170
 to start with the method 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.180
 of Sara an intermediate variation we must 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.970
 of being the two algorithms that we are going to 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.340
 use the first one is the one 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.190
 we already know 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.040
 It goes up it 's up with no, we 're going to 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.170
 call from now on that is another 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.310
 sure it would be its opposite 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.450
 first it would lower this one 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 and then this but 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.320
 entities is algorithm what are we going to call 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.250
 h to see him again 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.250
 low 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.239
 that's the algorithms we're going to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.580
 use of the navigator s and h 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 so what difference does this have 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.270
 variation to the beginner the first 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 layer solves the equally I 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.540
 intuitively the difference is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.470
 Find when making the layer 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.880
 higher since in the variation 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 beginner we put first the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 corner and then the center in the version 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 intermediate we are going to do these two steps 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.570
 on one only 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 and this is going to be divided in three cases the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.330
 category one case of Category 2 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 the Category 3 will see the category 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630
 one 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.820
 category one has three cases 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 we fixed that it is the case of standing that already 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.460
 we know but we must also look 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620
 where is the center in this case the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.050
 center 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:48.200
 until here then when applying an s 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.480
 directly the layer will be solved 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.480
 top let's see the next grass 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.990
 the next case would be an end case 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.830
 really here we can see it but the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.860
 center is no longer here if it is not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.990
 the other side here for if we do 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.650
 directly the normal tee 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.210
 the center has not been placed how to do 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.170
 so that the center is placed and once 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.600
 let's take the case from here we're going to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.590
 make an h that the new algorithm that 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.590
 we learned 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.570
 and if the top layer has been resolved and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.350
 finally the third case of the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.350
 category 1 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.840
 that would be we have here the case of you 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.020
 but now the center is not even here 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.150
 and over here if this is not up here 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.910
 case we will take as the case 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.220
 previous from this point of view and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.000
 let's do 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.000
 efe 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.720
 again this 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.620
 and those are the three category 1 cases 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.960
 let's see the four cases of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 categories 2 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.730
 I will show in the first of them 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
 this is the first case of category 2 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.250
 and the n 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.590
 and here is the center we're going to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.510
 take equal 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.439
 and let's go 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.439
 first one time 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.680
 now we do 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.680
 and we make a 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.980
 we go with the second category 2 case 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.150
 now this case here we have 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.980
 and over here that is in percent 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.730
 normally as we take a l we do 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.730
 first one time 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.560
 and now 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.720
 in the case of the end 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.320
 let's put you near 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.419
 in third case 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.210
 in this case we will take it this way 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.210
 First 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.690
 we have another h 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.380
 we go with the fourth case 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.350
 the fourth case would be here is the ly 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.030
 around here we take this form if we do 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.030
 a first h 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.480
 a property 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.980
 let's go with category 3 cases 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.030
 in the case of category 3 we had 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.590
 here a helmet standing and the center is 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.230
 located on this side 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.210
 notice that it is not even here 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.380
 nor around here if you are not now 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.690
 strong this side 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.690
 this case we 're going to take it first like this 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.690
 the case of you and we're going to do it once 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.790
 then we make an h 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:00.170
 of premium and other h 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.170
 we go with the following case 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.340
 now we have again a case of ping 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.960
 the center is not on this side 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.200
 let's put it back 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.260
 and we execute 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.100
 efe 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.870
 again 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.870
 of 21 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.620
 and we go with the last case 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.569
 the last case an ele and the center is 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.779
 on top 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:47.469
 let's take the study so we make a 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.469
 act first 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.290
 we make 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.230
 once 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.230
 and again once 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:03.740
 and those are the three categories 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.310
 of the top layer and then the new 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.430
 have made the layer of that layer 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.950
 we will solve the sides as such 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:17.360
 the beginner variation here I have 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:20.259
 an orange center and the oranges 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.259
 and I apply
