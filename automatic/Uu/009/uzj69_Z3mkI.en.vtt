well got here is a laser thermometer
it's<00:00:16.700> absolutely<00:00:17.180> I<00:00:17.210> agree<00:00:17.300> with<00:00:17.900> checking

it's absolutely I agree with checking
the<00:00:18.530> temperature<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:19.070> chocolates

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730

nice<00:00:20.240> it's<00:00:20.480> heavily<00:00:20.840> now<00:00:20.960> it's<00:00:21.590> very

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
nice it's heavily now it's very

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.749 
nice it's heavily now it's very
important<00:00:22.930> in<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.080> guidelines

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.390 

Vanessa<00:00:27.759> look<00:00:28.060> it's<00:00:29.019> extremely<00:00:29.619> shiny<00:00:30.009> each

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
Vanessa look it's extremely shiny each

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.660 
Vanessa look it's extremely shiny each
others<00:00:30.849> without<00:00:31.539> any<00:00:31.689> fat

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.050 

you<00:00:40.420> set<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.810> microwave<00:00:41.610> I've<00:00:42.610> set<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:42.940> on<00:00:43.030> a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
you set the microwave I've set it on a

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.870 
you set the microwave I've set it on a
medium<00:00:43.510> setting<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.800> going<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.040> give<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.220> 52nd

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
medium setting I'm going to give it 52nd

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.750 
medium setting I'm going to give it 52nd
it<00:00:45.970> bursts<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:47.050> begin<00:00:47.320> with<00:00:47.530> but<00:00:48.220> as<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:48.520> starts

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
it bursts to begin with but as it starts

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.500 
it bursts to begin with but as it starts
to<00:00:48.970> melt<00:00:49.180> up<00:00:49.510> increase<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.110> amount

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.830 

and<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> idea<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.590> to<00:00:53.800> make<00:00:53.920> sure

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and the idea is to make sure

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.320 
and the idea is to make sure
never<00:00:55.140> exceeds<00:00:55.680> loss<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:58.280> groupies

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
never exceeds loss about the groupies

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.030 
never exceeds loss about the groupies
chocolates<00:01:00.330> actually<00:01:00.720> a<00:01:00.750> heating<00:01:01.350> through<00:01:01.620> we

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
chocolates actually a heating through we

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040 
chocolates actually a heating through we
get<00:01:02.160> into

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
get into

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.900 
get into
I've<00:01:03.380> got<00:01:03.560> a<00:01:03.590> little<00:01:03.740> bowls<00:01:04.040> atmosphere<00:01:04.730> of

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
I've got a little bowls atmosphere of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.910 
I've got a little bowls atmosphere of
chocolates<00:01:05.449> I'm<00:01:05.690> gonna<00:01:05.900> drop<00:01:06.200> into<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.590> after

to see this what happens when you see
that<00:01:09.920> this<00:01:10.130> cold<00:01:10.460> chakra<00:01:10.970> goes<00:01:11.150> into<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
that this cold chakra goes into the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.290 
that this cold chakra goes into the
temperature<00:01:13.580> down

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.480 

and<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:16.840> instance

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
45 degrees but I'm taking the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.300 
45 degrees but I'm taking the
temperature<00:01:26.240> now<00:01:26.659> by<00:01:27.619> mixing<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.070> gold

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
temperature now by mixing the gold

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.820

kind of make sure it's clean and become

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.410 
kind of make sure it's clean and become
trend<00:02:05.100> lots<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:07.729> fill<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> mold<00:02:09.119> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
trend lots of it to fill the mold just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.259 
trend lots of it to fill the mold just
go<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> side<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:11.190> sunset<00:02:11.670> house<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
so what I'm doing I'm just using a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.910 
so what I'm doing I'm just using a
little<00:02:55.360> piping<00:02:55.930> bag<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> pop<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> air

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
little piping bag just to pop the air

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.730 
little piping bag just to pop the air
little<00:02:57.310> mini<00:02:57.460> eggs<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:58.170> now<00:02:59.170> again<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.560> could

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
little mini eggs in now again they could

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.260 
little mini eggs in now again they could
be<00:02:59.890> filled<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:00.340> these<00:03:00.490> are<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.760> small<00:03:01.090> they're

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
be filled but these are so small they're

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.850 
be filled but these are so small they're
probably<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:01.900> out<00:03:02.020> or<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:02.710> as<00:03:02.800> a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
probably going to be out or just as a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.320 
probably going to be out or just as a
solid<00:03:03.220> chocolate<00:03:03.580> icing<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:07.090> I'll<00:03:07.150> go<00:03:07.300> through

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
solid chocolate icing so I'll go through

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.760 
solid chocolate icing so I'll go through
and<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:07.780> polished<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:08.500> mold

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
and it's just polished in this mold

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.080 
and it's just polished in this mold
again<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> make<00:03:09.430> sure<00:03:09.700> there's<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.970> nice

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
