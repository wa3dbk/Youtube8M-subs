00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
that's pretty pathetic I just I don't

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.050 
that's pretty pathetic I just I don't
know<00:01:46.990> why<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.530> really<00:01:47.920> never<00:01:48.190> did<00:01:48.399> legs<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.850> guess

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
know why I really never did legs I guess

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.359 
know why I really never did legs I guess
again<00:01:49.299> because<00:01:49.929> no<00:01:50.440> one<00:01:50.590> was<00:01:50.740> looking<00:01:50.860> at<00:01:51.130> them

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
again because no one was looking at them

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.090 
again because no one was looking at them
so<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.729> didn't<00:01:52.090> care<00:01:52.360> well<00:01:53.350> needless<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.979> say

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
so I didn't care well needless to say

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
so I didn't care well needless to say
after<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.789> year<00:01:55.329> of<00:01:55.950> training<00:01:56.950> them<00:01:57.310> without

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
after a year of training them without

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.490 
after a year of training them without
squats<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.090> what<00:02:01.299> they<00:02:01.420> look<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:01.659> so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
squats that is what they look like so

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.069 
squats that is what they look like so
that's<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.829> one-year<00:02:03.310> difference<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:04.450> you

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
that's a one-year difference now you

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.810 
that's a one-year difference now you
might<00:02:05.259> be<00:02:05.289> asking<00:02:05.680> why<00:02:05.920> didn't<00:02:06.159> he<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.399> squats

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
might be asking why didn't he do squats

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.349 
might be asking why didn't he do squats
well<00:02:07.530> reason<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.619> because<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.190> have<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.030> muscle

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.359 
well reason is because I have a muscle

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.289 
well reason is because I have a muscle
strain<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:11.079> the<00:02:11.200> back<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.620> my<00:02:11.799> knee<00:02:11.859> so<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:13.180> you

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
strain in the back of my knee so if you

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.840 
strain in the back of my knee so if you
think<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.620> being<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.700> back

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
think of like this being like the back

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
think of like this being like the back
of<00:02:16.060> my<00:02:16.209> knee<00:02:16.269> when<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.470> completely

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
of my knee when it's completely

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.330 
of my knee when it's completely
inflection<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.329> hurts<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.900> hell

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
inflection like this it hurts like hell

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.640

what<00:02:27.489> I'm<00:02:27.579> trying<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.880> say<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.510> built<00:02:29.200> my

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
what I'm trying to say is I built my

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.140 
what I'm trying to say is I built my
legs<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.190> they're<00:02:30.549> nothing<00:02:30.970> too

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
legs I know they're nothing too

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
impressive or anything like that but the

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.509 
impressive or anything like that but the
progression<00:02:34.329> I<00:02:34.450> think<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.870> pretty<00:02:35.109> impressive
