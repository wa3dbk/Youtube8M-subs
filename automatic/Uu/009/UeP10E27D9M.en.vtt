00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.290
 before you washing vacuum cleaner thomas very 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.660
 good unit simple in design 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 therefore reliable and powerful and easy to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.800
 managing his only tangible 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.990
 minus is the body material 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.330
 but about the design of the material a little 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.339
 later at first a little tuning which 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.780
 not only will increase the comfort of operation 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:23.510
 but also extend the life of the device 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.070
 let's start with the obvious right up since 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.930
 the vacuum cleaner is not equipped with a coiling system 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.280
 cord then it makes sense to purchase here 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.280
 such a reel for cable storage 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.600
 rise above 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.360
 corrugated hose has not been 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.220
 fix cable ties this 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.660
 prevent accidental slipping off 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.280
 nozzle due to temperature 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.320
 extensions from warm water well and removable 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.150
 control lever dispenser can also 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.070
 pull down to the handle so he 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.720
 did not fall out of the mounting grooves like me 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 I speak the material of which is made 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.830
 vacuum cleaner and obviously insufficient strength 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.930
 handle hose burst a couple of years 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.430
 operation had to fix it 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 all the same wire clamp and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.660
 additionally coat with cold welding 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.830
 hose mount can break off if 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.470
 pull the vacuum cleaner tightly 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.270
 heavy over water to avoid breakage 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.040
 uve can be pre-strengthened 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.810
 mounts by cold welding or 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.000
 under strong resin without hoses vacuum cleaner 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.350
 especially similar to the pd2 robot that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.570
 will appeal to star lovers 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.290
 of wars 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 Now a little about the principle of work 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.750
 as i have 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 the design is very simple and in essence 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 consists of two buckets 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.380
 inserted into one another 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 from one vacuum cleaner sprays on the floor 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.960
 clean water and in the second I'm going 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.960
 semi dirty 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.230
 central part of the top cover 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 sucks air through a special 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.460
 valve preventing water from entering 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.470
 engine 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.090
 and through this hose from the top bucket 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.340
 water is sucked for later 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 spraying and it is here especially 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 it is very noticeable that the body material 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.729
 wrong picked up this one of two ears 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.869
 fasteners that fasten the top and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.869
 bottom of the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 apparently the loop is very thin and small 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.030
 The dimensions are completely at odds with 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 the load that this node is experiencing 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.989
 proper 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 one day she had to tear herself up 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.650
 epoxy resin loop better strengthened 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.569
 in advance so how exactly do they have to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 the whole load when you lift the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.610
 by the handle 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.530
 if you insure against damage in advance 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.300
 the place of attachment of the loop then otherwise 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 This is a very reliable vacuum cleaner and also 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.140
 very easy to use 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.849
 turn on the handle vacuum cleaner 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.099
 pours water on the floor and immediately collects it 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.930
 back this way you can be any 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.940
 floor coverings including carpet 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 as well as glass door sill and 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.810
 other flat surfaces besides 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.640
 removing the pipe with a vacuum cleaner is very convenient 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.709
 pull out oily hair and other 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.900
 abominations clogged sink and bath sink 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.640
 after use it is enough to drain 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.590
 clean and dirty water toilets 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.040
 rinse you capacity and put them on 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 drying
