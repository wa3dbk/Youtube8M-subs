see can't get the few not skills but

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.949 
see can't get the few not skills but
that<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.069> mean<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.849> pads<00:02:09.179> i<00:02:09.300> would<00:02:09.420> say<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that just mean the pads i would say you

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.300 
that just mean the pads i would say you
know<00:02:10.080> influencers<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> lot<00:02:10.920> better<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.250> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
know influencers a lot better with this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.830 
know influencers a lot better with this
in<00:02:11.760> my<00:02:11.849> opinion<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.540> just

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
in my opinion it's just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
in my opinion it's just
but<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.110> think<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.560> forms<00:02:13.860> are<00:02:14.010> easier<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.340> pick

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
but I think in forms are easier to pick

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.430 
but I think in forms are easier to pick
up<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.030> pituitary<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:16.050> picking<00:02:16.349> up

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
up with this pituitary then picking up

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.660 
up with this pituitary then picking up
normal<00:02:16.739> cards<00:02:16.920> which<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.160> guess<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.489> kind<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
normal cards which I guess it's kind of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.180
