00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.790
 Good day to your attention 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 video review of the moulinex bread machine 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 and here we are right now 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.990
 before you stove already tested 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 repeatedly it turns out like this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.850
 neat even bread no longer become 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.850
 so you can safely reach out 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.390
 shake easy enough 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 here you see a trace of a mixing auger 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.960
 that's actually itself leads to here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 you see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 the man is not clean enough 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.850
 internal device remains 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:01.949
 the stove itself is fasting fixed 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 easy but reliable enough 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:13.200
 fairly silently accordingly we 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 we see bread itself is bread by itself 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.560
 simple recipe French bread but with 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.560
 adding raisins in this case 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 one chicken egg was added to the recipe 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.159
 but at the same time the volume of liquid remained 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 no change here in the end we see here 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.939
 so here it is me a jar size 750 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.200
 gram max in this bread maker 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.020
 you can make bread weighing 1 kilogram 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.810
 but here we see the tank quite well and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 exactly baked in this bread machine 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.399
 there are 15 programs here now i'm 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.100
 I will try to show the white one 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.610
 bread fast baking bread french 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.160
 loaf bread wholemeal well and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 meme many varieties of bread and besides 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.610
 can still knead the text of the dough 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:29.920
 cook muffins jam here actually 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:33.670
 here's a stove now we turn it on here 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.730
 it is served from someone always and at the same time on 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.980
 time number appears on the screen 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.150
 program number the program chooses with 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.690
 menu button 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.910
 we are seeing a changing program changing 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.750
 accordingly, the time flew me brides 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 changes so no button here with the left 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 side of the slider appears which 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.640
 points out against a particular view 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.980
 here are three options 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.700
 the crusts are darker lighter too 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.989
 respectively, the tags with this button and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.190
 this sample is changing 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.340
 either the medium crust was cooked 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.660
 Well, if you do not add eggs then something 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.840
 the same color is obtained by crust 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.820
 the maximum position of the engine he 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:33.070
 it starts just by pressing the start button 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:36.190
 here and here we hear she moves here in 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.440
 the time of inclusion has no buttons 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.220
 act which is very convenient especially if 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.200
 you have a little baby but in the case of all 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.720
 if you were mistaken and you need 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.959
 stop then press for long 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.600
 buttons start after this mechanism 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:58.660
 stops but here we are new now 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.820

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 kneading will not and I once again without 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.730
 about including here the actual size 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.090

 Here the stove works quite reliably 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.830
 operation time while complaints 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.620
 no of course in operation yet 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.850
 short little more than a week but not 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:59.229
 less already showed itself enough 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:03.610
 good when working walls do not bask on 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:08.590
 the glass is of course heated but get burned again 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:12.729
 it won't get enough in so quickly 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.099
 all the same easy to feel the heat and 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.819
 in general 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:20.729
 have time to remove your hand 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:26.550
 here is actually a stove 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:29.749
 the weight of the bread machine is about seven kilograms 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.419
 Well, pretty good in principle 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:36.120
 plastic case but in general 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.770
 enough quality outsiders 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.430
 baking odors 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.789
 No, that's why in general, you can safely 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:53.969
 enjoy was bought in meters by 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:56.219
 shares and in general, everything is fine 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.710
 no complaints but if someone 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:01.560
 there will be some specific question possible 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.620
 I can write a personal message 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.710
 prompt and something in more detail 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.509
