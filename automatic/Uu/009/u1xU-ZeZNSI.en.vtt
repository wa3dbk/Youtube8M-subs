00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
second natural and arbiter should be

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.230 
second natural and arbiter should be
careful<00:00:29.130> though<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.429> got<00:00:29.580> almost<00:00:29.760> no<00:00:29.970> HP

natural stasis on the tanks as they come
out<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> siege<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:46.079> nice<00:00:46.260> move<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.500> by

pretty<00:02:31.959> soon<00:02:32.200> though<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.590> combined<00:02:33.190> with<00:02:33.370> the

pretty soon though and combined with the
stasis<00:02:33.700> combined<00:02:34.180> with<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> gigantic

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
numerical advantage that's going to be

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729 
numerical advantage that's going to be
enough<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.140> know<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.380> could<00:02:38.500> be<00:02:38.650> seeing

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
enough and you know we could be seeing

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.770 
enough and you know we could be seeing
some<00:02:38.950> recalls<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.550> said<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.540> is

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
some recalls like I said that is

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.009 
some recalls like I said that is
certainly<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:42.430> very<00:02:42.700> solid<00:02:43.060> move<00:02:43.239> by

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
certainly a very very solid move by

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.330 
certainly a very very solid move by
reach<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.530> he<00:02:44.620> decides<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.220> big

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
reach if he decides to go for a big

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.940 
reach if he decides to go for a big
recall<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.910> would<00:02:46.120> certainly<00:02:46.330> end<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.780> game

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
recall that would certainly end the game

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.410 
recall that would certainly end the game
pretty<00:02:47.950> much<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.130> recall<00:02:48.459> anywhere<00:02:48.819> would<00:02:49.239> end

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
pretty much a recall anywhere would end

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.210 
pretty much a recall anywhere would end
the<00:02:49.540> game<00:02:49.660> at<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.900> point<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:51.069> there's

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the game at this point and there's

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.039 
the game at this point and there's
another<00:02:51.459> arbiter<00:02:52.000> there's<00:02:52.360> another<00:02:52.600> arbiter

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
another arbiter there's another arbiter

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.509 
another arbiter there's another arbiter
and<00:02:53.080> reach<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:53.709> looks<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.100> he's<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.340> going

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and reach now looks like he's just going

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.920 
and reach now looks like he's just going
to<00:02:54.580> sell<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.940> his<00:02:55.120> way<00:02:55.269> into<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.690> base

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to sell it his way into the base

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.479 
to sell it his way into the base
actually<00:02:56.440> doesn't<00:02:57.069> matter<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.310> there's<00:02:57.459> a

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
actually doesn't matter if there's a

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.979 
actually doesn't matter if there's a
gigantic<00:02:58.000> minefield<00:02:58.450> doesn't<00:02:58.660> even<00:02:58.810> matter

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
gigantic minefield doesn't even matter

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.039 
gigantic minefield doesn't even matter
if<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.519> arbiter<00:03:00.519> gets<00:03:00.700> EMP<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.330> reaches<00:03:01.900> its

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
if the arbiter gets EMP it reaches its

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.380 
if the arbiter gets EMP it reaches its
gonna<00:03:02.200> move<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:02.620> about<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.459> 30<00:03:03.850> zealots

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
gonna move in about like 30 zealots

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.960 
gonna move in about like 30 zealots
there<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.230> should<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.500> enough<00:03:05.970> there's

just so many zealots oh my god looks
like<00:03:09.940> actually<00:03:10.269> reach<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.569> not<00:03:10.600> gonna<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:10.989> able

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
like actually reach is not gonna be able

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.509 
like actually reach is not gonna be able
to<00:03:11.200> finish<00:03:11.440> him<00:03:11.680> off<00:03:11.709> with<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:12.100> speed<00:03:12.310> lot

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
to finish him off with just speed lot

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.180 
to finish him off with just speed lot
that's<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.750> little<00:03:14.080> bit<00:03:14.319> too<00:03:14.500> many<00:03:14.709> speed<00:03:15.010> lots

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
that's a little bit too many speed lots

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.710 
that's a little bit too many speed lots
and<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.489> enough<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.790> other<00:03:15.910> units<00:03:16.269> well<00:03:16.450> looks

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and not enough of other units well looks

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.509 
and not enough of other units well looks
like<00:03:16.780> he<00:03:17.019> by<00:03:17.530> baby<00:03:17.769> was<00:03:17.920> actually<00:03:18.190> expanding

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
like he by baby was actually expanding

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.970
