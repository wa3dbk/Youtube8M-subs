think<00:00:13.190> let's<00:00:14.190> get<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.020> Kerrigan<00:00:16.020> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
think let's get on with this Kerrigan a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.230 
think let's get on with this Kerrigan a
little<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:16.890> different<00:00:17.279> there's<00:00:17.640> no<00:00:17.820> eco<00:00:18.119> on

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
little bit different there's no eco on

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.210 
little bit different there's no eco on
this<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.690> these<00:00:18.810> don't<00:00:19.020> matter<00:00:19.260> wild

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
this one so these don't matter wild

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
this one so these don't matter wild

army we actually want wrap feelings on
this<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.450> normally<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> call<00:00:40.530> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this one normally not what I call for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.299 
this one normally not what I call for
but<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:43.309> definitely

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
but we're going to go for it definitely

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
want speed the attack speed and stuff is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
want speed the attack speed and stuff is
kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> life<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.760> one's<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
kind of the life on this one's kind of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
kind of the life on this one's kind of
nice<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.140> movespeed<00:00:50.070> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
nice to I think but movespeed just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
nice to I think but movespeed just
really<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.000> especially<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:52.079> they're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
really good especially when they're

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
really good especially when they're
jumping<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.559> over<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> place<00:00:52.940> for<00:00:53.940> banelings

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
jumping all over the place for banelings

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
jumping all over the place for banelings
we<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.750> corrosive<00:00:55.379> damage<00:00:55.710> hundred<00:00:56.039> percent

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
we want corrosive damage hundred percent

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
we want corrosive damage hundred percent
splash<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.059> hundred<00:00:57.120> percent<00:00:57.300> date-based

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
splash or one hundred percent date-based

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.209 
splash or one hundred percent date-based
damage<00:00:58.850> don't<00:00:59.850> care<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.120> healing<00:01:01.160> okay<00:01:02.160> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
damage don't care about healing okay so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.050 
damage don't care about healing okay so
on<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.940> mission<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
on with this mission this is one of the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.370 
on with this mission this is one of the
trickier<00:01:06.060> challenges<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.200> will

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
trickier challenges I think you will

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.870 
trickier challenges I think you will
want<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> save<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> couple<00:01:08.189> times<00:01:08.520> along<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
want to save a couple times along the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
want to save a couple times along the
way<00:01:09.030> I'll<00:01:09.780> show<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> found<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
way I'll show you the way I found is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
way I'll show you the way I found is
most<00:01:11.340> efficient<00:01:11.880> whether<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
most efficient whether or not that is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.270 
most efficient whether or not that is
true<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.280> anyone's<00:01:15.090> guess<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
true or not is anyone's guess and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
true or not is anyone's guess and
hopefully<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:17.970> feel<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.420> once<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.720> twice

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
hopefully I only feel like once or twice

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530 
hopefully I only feel like once or twice
because<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.799> probably<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.330> there's<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
because I probably will there's a lot of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760 
because I probably will there's a lot of
randomness<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
randomness I think when you have you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
randomness I think when you have you
know<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:23.009> arm<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> hundred<00:01:23.790> banelings

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
know an arm you have a hundred banelings

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.649 
know an arm you have a hundred banelings
and<00:01:24.479> links<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> doing<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.350> want

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
and links kind of doing what they want

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
and links kind of doing what they want
so<00:01:27.659> first<00:01:28.049> things<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.710> selects<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.549> for

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so first things first it selects all for

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.970 
so first things first it selects all for
you

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.090 
you
Plus<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:31.670> down<00:01:32.150> we're<00:01:32.390> going<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.570> drop<00:01:32.780> our

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
Plus this down we're going to drop our

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.560 
Plus this down we're going to drop our
Aeon<00:01:34.100> them<00:01:34.310> already<00:01:40.090> try<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.150> take<00:01:41.330> out<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
Aeon them already try and take out the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.690 
Aeon them already try and take out the
tanks<00:01:42.050> as<00:01:42.320> fast<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.220> can

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.389 

and<00:01:46.939> let's<00:01:47.630> save<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.710> real<00:01:48.950> quick<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.310> I

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
and let's save this real quick so I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.920 
and let's save this real quick so I
think<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.670> lot<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.880> my<00:01:50.060> units<00:01:50.360> survive<00:01:50.659> there

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
think a lot of my units survive there

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.950 
think a lot of my units survive there
that's<00:01:51.170> good<00:01:53.079> f2<00:01:55.000> f2<00:01:56.000> s<00:01:56.060> get<00:01:56.299> here<00:01:56.509> because

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
that's good f2 f2 s get here because

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.760 
that's good f2 f2 s get here because
yeah<00:01:59.960> oh<00:02:00.289> shut<00:02:00.860> up<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:03.380> should<00:02:03.619> get

see what happen this final battle I just

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.600 
see what happen this final battle I just
wild<00:03:32.050> mutation<00:03:32.530> my<00:03:32.650> front<00:03:32.920> line<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.370> they<00:03:33.550> were

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
wild mutation my front line so they were

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.430 
wild mutation my front line so they were
super<00:03:34.000> tanky<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.510> sent<00:03:34.750> them<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.050> move-in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
super tanky and I sent them a move-in

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.070 
super tanky and I sent them a move-in
when<00:03:36.430> some<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.670> them<00:03:36.850> got<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.690> moved

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
when some of them got in here I moved

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.900 
when some of them got in here I moved
him<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.680> little<00:03:38.830> bit<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.310> move<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.760> try

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
him in just a little bit a move to try

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.310 
him in just a little bit a move to try
and<00:03:40.030> absorb<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.450> fire<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:40.960> my<00:03:41.140> banelings

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
and absorb the fire so that my banelings

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.950 
and absorb the fire so that my banelings
could<00:03:41.800> get<00:03:41.920> into<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> planetary

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
could get into the planetary

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.090 
could get into the planetary
unfortunately<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.080> planetary<00:03:44.560> targeted<00:03:45.010> my

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
unfortunately the planetary targeted my

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.490 
unfortunately the planetary targeted my
banelings<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.700> took<00:03:45.820> out<00:03:45.970> like<00:03:46.000> four<00:03:46.330> or<00:03:46.450> five

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
banelings it took out like four or five

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500 
banelings it took out like four or five
but<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> was<00:03:47.830> still<00:03:48.070> able<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.430> get<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.300> there

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
but I was still able to get on in there

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.480 
but I was still able to get on in there

Kerrigan if you are quick enough has

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.890 
Kerrigan if you are quick enough has
time<00:03:51.730> for<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.090> over<00:03:52.390> 300<00:03:52.870> damage<00:03:53.170> moves<00:03:53.440> too<00:03:53.680> so

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
time for to over 300 damage moves too so

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.630 
time for to over 300 damage moves too so
yeah<00:03:55.900> that'll<00:03:56.709> worked<00:03:56.860> out<00:03:57.070> we<00:03:57.340> still<00:03:57.580> have

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
yeah that'll worked out we still have

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.460 
yeah that'll worked out we still have
nine<00:03:57.850> seconds<00:03:58.270> till<00:03:58.390> nuclear<00:03:58.780> strike<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.380> I

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
nine seconds till nuclear strike and I

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.930 
nine seconds till nuclear strike and I
don't<00:03:59.860> think<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.220> actually<00:04:00.370> had<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.670> load<00:04:00.820> my

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
don't think I actually had to load my

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.130 
don't think I actually had to load my
game<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.310> recap<00:04:03.750> they're<00:04:04.750> going<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:04.959> do<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
game so to recap they're going to do the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.810 
game so to recap they're going to do the
nuke<00:04:05.260> stuff<00:04:05.530> but<00:04:05.770> take<00:04:06.070> this<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.400> fast<00:04:06.610> as<00:04:06.790> you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
nuke stuff but take this as fast as you

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.180 
nuke stuff but take this as fast as you
can<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:08.170> want<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.410> take<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> bottom<00:04:09.010> right

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
can you want to take the bottom right

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.430 
can you want to take the bottom right
area<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.910> don't<00:04:10.090> fight<00:04:10.390> everything<00:04:10.690> but

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
area so you don't fight everything but

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.780 
area so you don't fight everything but
you<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.709> go<00:04:11.800> far<00:04:12.010> enough<00:04:12.130> up<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.670> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
you have to go far enough up that you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.940 
you have to go far enough up that you
get<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> units<00:04:13.390> back<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:13.930> then<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.800> just

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
get the units back and then you just

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.560 
get the units back and then you just
want<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.220> group<00:04:15.370> up<00:04:15.519> right<00:04:15.730> outside<00:04:15.910> wild

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
want to group up right outside wild

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.520 
want to group up right outside wild
mutation<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.320> smash<00:04:17.680> on<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.489> there<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:20.080> we're

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
mutation and smash on in there and we're

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.539 
mutation and smash on in there and we're
not<00:04:20.650> going<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.890> do<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.070> rest<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.459> mission

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
not going to do the rest of the mission
