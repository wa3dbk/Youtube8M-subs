00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.059 
and and it just depends on your
circumstances<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> smallest

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
circumstances but I think the smallest

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
circumstances but I think the smallest
thing<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.700> brave<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:15.090> mean<00:02:15.239> sometimes<00:02:15.480> just

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
thing can be brave I mean sometimes just

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.300 
thing can be brave I mean sometimes just

your life who you admire for being brave
I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:23.310> my<00:02:23.430> mom<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.750> very<00:02:25.290> very

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I think my mom actually is very very

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.210 
I think my mom actually is very very
brave<00:02:26.129> lady<00:02:26.550> she<00:02:26.790> she<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:28.590> had<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.010> lot<00:02:29.160> of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
brave lady she she and I had a lot of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.509 
brave lady she she and I had a lot of
illness<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.390> combat<00:02:30.810> when<00:02:30.959> she<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> child

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
illness to combat when she was a child

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.890 
illness to combat when she was a child
so<00:02:32.519> do<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.879> think<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.269> movie<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
so do you think the movie and the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.320 
so do you think the movie and the
characters<00:02:34.440> depict<00:02:34.950> Scotland<00:02:35.580> accurately<00:02:36.120> or

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
characters depict Scotland accurately or

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.869 
characters depict Scotland accurately or
authentically<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.069> gets<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> humor

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
authentically I think it gets the humor

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.100 
authentically I think it gets the humor
of<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:40.319> Scottish<00:02:40.709> people<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.959> think<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
of the Scottish people and I think the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.530 
of the Scottish people and I think the
landscape<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.800> well<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.580> very<00:02:45.360> authentic

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
landscape as well is is very authentic

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.540 
landscape as well is is very authentic
and<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.640> best<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:48.090> Scotland
