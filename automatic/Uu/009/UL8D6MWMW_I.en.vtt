is<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.300> simple<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> biggest

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
is really simple probably the biggest

is really simple probably the biggest
challenge<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.039> turning<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> year<00:02:12.209> old<00:02:12.450> analog

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
challenge is turning the year old analog

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.830 
challenge is turning the year old analog

so<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.290> get<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.849> antenna

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
so you can get to the to the antenna

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.710 
so you can get to the to the antenna
inputs<00:02:17.580> now<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.760> we've<00:02:18.880> turned<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.360> analog

that's<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.580> your<00:04:46.570> digital<00:04:46.990> analog<00:04:47.410> converter

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
that's it your digital analog converter

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.890 
that's it your digital analog converter
box<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.220> really<00:04:48.640> easy<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.030> set<00:04:49.240> up<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.450> you're
