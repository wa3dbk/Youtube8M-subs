00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 water friends her pandas we end up 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.080
 today for a brand new 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.299
 video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 the new update has just been released 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.880
 and as you may know or not 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.030
 there is a new defense defense 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 it is the air thruster also called 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 the hair dryer so it serves to dry 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.369
 the scales of the dragons or dried them 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.160
 balloons so they can take off 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.770
 no more seriously it serves to 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.140
 shifted the troops for example see 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.660
 so the troops are coming here you me 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.330
 pose they are directly powered end 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.450
 so here I do not know if you see 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.070
 but the troops arrive we put them to 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.750
 outside the village arrived at will be 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.730
 pushed back outside the village is 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.900
 so this defense is one of those 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.550
 I'm going to talk to you today I'm going 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.059
 not to talk to you about the rest of the game 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.410
 up to date but there are several little tips 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.300
 at the level of the update that have me 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.320
 seems to be nice so that's not what 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.449
 I will talk to you today but I 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.700
 I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.870
 men little bit about how 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.479
 can we use this well 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.399
 defense there so this defense actually has 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.890
 actually even alone is not used to 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.750
 much aster just to slow down but 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.220
 we can use it as a way again 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.740
 more defensive it means that you have to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.539
 to be used to better use it will take 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.310
 to double it with an anti- aerial or a 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.920
 hell ride for example if you 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.670
 also you are hdv May 10 where there lÃ© 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.440
 for example if I if I ask there we go 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560
 to say if I pose poses the air thruster 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.280
 we're just going to do it you're going 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.420
 so see if I put the propeller out of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.069
 rare there we will say almost not even 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.119
 those the most optimized it would be at 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:46.420
 mortar level here we are going to say that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.929
 here and so as you will see here 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.910
 you will have the line so you can the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:57.280
 rotate every time so that's it 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:01.500
 so like that and so there me as you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 see this is at an area from 2 kw to 2 4 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.119
 a bit of blood degree we'll say two 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 projections we will say here and there a 360 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.670
 and as we can see the area is a 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.709
 zone of a common zone between the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 the two defenses and that's the area we 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.640
 will actually use because the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.780
 Persians when they go to ask their 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.970
 dragons for example the dragons are going 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.110
 to arrive they go first attacked there so 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.489
 they are already going to get started 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.489
 push back when they will start to 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.310
 advance the aerial lens goes the 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.170
 typing is going to type them and 16 this defense 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.670
 there will still push them back what will 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.080
 to do that they will be done even more 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.550
 typed by the old so these 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.020
 techniques like that it would take 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.640
 use 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.160
 after knowing where to place it in his 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.080
 village must find a place a good 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.730
 place where the place and so I you 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.620
 give some techniques so I have 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.700
 thought about that so I do not know if there is 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.560
 will have two hours tubes they will have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.480
 done before me good I think it takes 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.890
 use it like that after it's everyone 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 see how they use me I 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.740
 will use it like that so we use 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.110
 antiaircraft cayla here this is where there 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.420
 that pushes back and the area that's between 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.800
 two so that a zone up to rent 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 up to this extractor there the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.160
 dragons will get hit by this and get 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.930
 will roll back so they will still make themselves 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.290
 more typed we are I do not know yet 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.440
 how much the statistics do not have the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.030
 statistics it may be marked no 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.040
 no marked in damage 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.740
 because end of propulsive aids by 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.030
 second and his dishes so here I am 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.550
 you might do another video 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.460
 to complete this one so here is 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.170
 how to use this this 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.060
 defense me it's a technique that I 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.950
 gives you next to you to see if if 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.330
 it's good or if it's not good I 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.420
 will use it like that I think because 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.040
 that's the best way to use it 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.390
 or even for example put it in place 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.650
 from the castle of clans so behind the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.569
 antiaircraft antiair like that 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.970
 will take all the defense and she 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.290
 will repel outdoors and so lanthier 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.819
 nothing will be even less affected 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.400
 so that's a technique like that 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.970
 it would take ten after this will be how 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.970
 cowboy 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.680
 how are they going to put their balloons 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.780
 but after for example if this he in 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.050
 add for example two have for in 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.819
 to put 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.050
 initiated one there is like that it will do 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.670
 on both sides 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.959
 he will have because it will be there will have 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.209
 even less likely to be done 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.500
 touch by them by the dragons so 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.600
 it's really techniques like that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.620
 that should be used 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.540
 I hope when there are two I do not know 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.450
 not if there are two another hdv in 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.970
 any case if there is a second one this 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.680
 will really be a defense that is who 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.120
 will really not be neglected because 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.140
 it can really change everything and I 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.250
 not even know I did not even know 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.030
 that I had not watched the sneak peek 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.250
 for this update 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.870
 I had not even out that the granny 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.600
 So here I am happy it's defense 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.850
 frankly I think that may well 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.890
 serve a little really serve well and 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.200
 change and damn gameplay so 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.720
 So here it is, it was a small 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.640
 fast video like that so I hope 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.740
 that she will have helped you know where 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.560
 place your skin propelling roads 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.850
 or your hair dryer and so that's it 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.320
 so I tell you to + second remember 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.120
 not to share this video for all 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.680
 your friends who want to know where the master 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540
 to subscribe if you are not always 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.070
 not and let a I like what did 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.910
 what he is really pleased about 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.540
 tell you smart or the world 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.540
 bye
