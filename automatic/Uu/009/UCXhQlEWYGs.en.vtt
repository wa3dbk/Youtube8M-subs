00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
goes in this you see and this jar here I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.360 
goes in this you see and this jar here I
already<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:12.660> some<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> ginger<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.590> into

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
something like that in into the mixing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.950 
something like that in into the mixing
bowl<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.050> that's<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.790> make<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.940> teaspoon<00:02:30.450> around

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
bowl so that's a make it teaspoon around

bowl so that's a make it teaspoon around
a<00:02:31.080> teaspoon<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.680> minced<00:02:32.220> garlic<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.820> then

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
a teaspoon of minced garlic and then

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.770 
a teaspoon of minced garlic and then
ginger<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.750> then<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.970> squeeze<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.390> putty<00:02:39.600> in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
ginger and then you squeeze the putty in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.740 
ginger and then you squeeze the putty in
it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.910 

I'd<00:02:47.290> say<00:02:47.620> two<00:02:48.370> rounded<00:02:49.090> tablespoons<00:02:50.490> start

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
I'd say two rounded tablespoons start

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.280 
I'd say two rounded tablespoons start
that's<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.010> teaspoon<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:58.290> and

that's a teaspoon that I have there and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.430 
that's a teaspoon that I have there and
then<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:01.300> five-spice<00:03:01.930> powder<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.380> very

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
then the five-spice powder is very

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.350 
then the five-spice powder is very
strong<00:03:02.980> flavoring<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:04.330> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
level teaspoon of that put that in there

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.870 
level teaspoon of that put that in there
and<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.530> tomato<00:03:11.860> shade<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:15.310> two

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.459 

when<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.700> tastes<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.840> could<00:04:04.019> use<00:04:04.200> maybe

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:04.469 
when that tastes like it could use maybe

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.220 
when that tastes like it could use maybe
another<00:04:04.769> tablespoon<00:04:05.219> of<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.870> honey
