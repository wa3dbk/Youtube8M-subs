00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.350
 hi how are you all i am mÃ³nica 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.700
 macaque and here we are back with 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.700
 this cooking tutorial 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.130
 and I discovered that it was zero plan of the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.930
 pumpkin because I had never tried it 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.669
 how my mom had bought the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.189
 pumpkins for halloween and decorate them 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.460
 all gave the task to get to 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.260
 look for recipes for things with fat you do not know 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.300
 I played nothing and I left it and postponed it 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.309
 and that's why I'm almost children 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.019
 preparing pumpkin desserts here 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.150
 This is the first one I made with pumpkin 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.739
 which is pumpkin or pumpkin pie 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.079
 pumpkin in case they have not been saturated 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.390
 that says pumpkin is very simple is 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.430
 so delicious the recipe let's start with 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.050
 this tutorial the ingredients that we're going 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.379
 to use I leave you here in this 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.480
 list but I make an observation 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.399
 very fast is that if you prepared 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.920
 his pumpkin puree with piloncillo 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.590
 they will only use one cup of sugar 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.050
 if they prepared the puree without any kind of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.600
 sweetener then if you are going to use 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.060
 two cups of sugar we will be able to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.690
 heat our oven to 250 degrees 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.690
 centigrade 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.450
 a super practical step and very useful for 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.210
 Let our cakes come out beautiful 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.159
 of the mold and look like pastry or 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 a lady who cooks a lot and 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.420
 Desserts go very well is that we go 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.460
 to flour our mold put a 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.310
 little oil or butter is 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.100
 have a good time with a napkin and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.259
 Sprinkle flour on top Take heed 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.080
 that covers all the walls of your mold 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.800
 Now in a container we are going to empty the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.610
 sugar the oil the four eggs and the 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.610
 pumpkin puree 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 Beat them very well to make a 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.040
 homogeneous mixture 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.950
 remember to clean your mash very well 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.020
 have no seeds or waste 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.490
 now in another container we are going to make 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.540
 near the flour and all our 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540
 dry ingredients 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 the seasoning of five species you can 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.930
 replace with these different spices 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.489
 mixing them all in equal parts and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 then taking the proportional amount 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.840
 what do we need to throw salt on 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.900
 baking soda 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.730
 cinnamon and all the other ingredients 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.730
 dry we are going to have them very well 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.180
 once you finish serving your 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.070
 dry ingredients we are going to join them with 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.650
 the mixture that we had prepared before 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.450
 that had our mash let's undo 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 well all the vomiting and that the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.830
 mix is homogeneous 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 Once you already like how it was 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.629
 our mix we are going to throw the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.269
 well chopped nuts can be medium to 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.790
 a cup of nuts according to the consistency 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.019
 that you want to give your your bread that I 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.019
 I put nothing else half 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.040
 empty the mixture in your mold cares well 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.350
 is well distributed and is uniform 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.750
 quantity in all areas of the mold 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.340
 help from a spatula so that it does not 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.340
 you waste nothing of the mixture 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.140
 place it in the oven and you're going to install 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.049
 about 40 minutes or take the test 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.909
 of the toothpick or the knife that when 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:42.000
 you see it well inflated and be the 40 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.000
 Minutes what peace it bites and comes out clean 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.319
 something that works for me to be 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.840
 unmold well is that when I can already 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.450
 grab the mold with my hands free 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.670
 hit the bread a little bit so that it 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.489
 start to take off and so in this way 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.989
 When I turn it over, I have a lot left 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.989
 easier and very nice 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.170
 to finish you can sprinkle 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.420
 icing sugar and decorate it with a little 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.780
 our whole or if you like the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.380
