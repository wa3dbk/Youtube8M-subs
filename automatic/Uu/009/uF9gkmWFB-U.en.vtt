the collar now if they aren't

now if this isn't possible another

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.029 
now if this isn't possible another
solution<00:01:25.060> would<00:01:25.270> be<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.450> mic<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.960> pastor<00:01:26.440> he

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
solution would be to mic the pastor he

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.380 
solution would be to mic the pastor he
is<00:01:27.159> close<00:01:27.429> to<00:01:27.580> both<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.850> bride<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.300> groom

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
and generally a bit further behind them

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.070 
and generally a bit further behind them
which<00:01:30.819> means<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.270> mic<00:01:31.509> clip<00:01:31.780> wouldn't

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
which means that a mic clip wouldn't

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.050 
which means that a mic clip wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:32.560> be<00:01:32.770> visible<00:01:32.800> in<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.789> wedding
