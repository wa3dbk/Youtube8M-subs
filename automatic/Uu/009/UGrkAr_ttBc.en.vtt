working<00:04:11.989> in<00:04:12.169> your<00:04:12.319> game<00:04:12.500> but<00:04:12.739> it's<00:04:13.370> best<00:04:13.639> to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
working in your game but it's best to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.599 
working in your game but it's best to
select<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.389> first<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:15.079> mostly<00:04:15.889> choose<00:04:16.130> iPad

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
select it first I mostly choose iPad

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.420 
select it first I mostly choose iPad
landscape<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.510> wants<00:04:17.840> me<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.139> it's

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
landscape so it wants me that it's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.970 
landscape so it wants me that it's
changing<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.579> size<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.389> game

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
changing the size of the game

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.710 
changing the size of the game
because<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.010> let's<00:04:22.250> change<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.580> back<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.880> iphone

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
because I let's change it back to iphone

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.600 
because I let's change it back to iphone

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
it's very easy cured actors and let's do

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.170 
it's very easy cured actors and let's do
a<00:04:39.890> little<00:04:40.040> something<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.610> show<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.850> how<00:04:41.120> it

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
a little something to show you how it

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.940 
a little something to show you how it
works<00:04:41.210> adjust<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.350> picture<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.740> myself

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
works adjust take a picture of myself

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.390 
works adjust take a picture of myself
and<00:04:43.690> put<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.810> inside<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.710> application<00:04:46.220> so

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
and put it inside of the application so

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.910 
and put it inside of the application so
it<00:04:46.550> creates<00:04:46.970> an<00:04:47.180> actor<00:04:47.600> it's<00:04:47.960> has<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.680> same

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
it creates an actor it's has the same

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.860 
it creates an actor it's has the same
name<00:04:49.190> as<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.490> file<00:04:49.880> which<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.150> me<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:50.720> that

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
name as the file which is me in that

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.200 
name as the file which is me in that
case<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.500> has<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.770> right<00:04:51.950> size<00:04:52.340> as<00:04:52.670> the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
case and it has the right size as the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.920 
case and it has the right size as the
picture<00:04:53.480> size<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.160> here<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.150> our<00:04:56.390> initial

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
picture size is so here is our initial

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.580 
picture size is so here is our initial
scene<00:04:57.200> we<00:04:57.560> go<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.980> scene<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.430> just<00:04:58.970> pull<00:04:59.270> my

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
scene we go to the scene I just pull my

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.610 
scene we go to the scene I just pull my
actor<00:05:00.590> inside<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.670> the<00:05:01.790> game<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.440> just<00:05:03.440> by

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
actor inside of the game and just by

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.890 
actor inside of the game and just by
clicking<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.700> site<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.180> holding<00:05:05.510> shift<00:05:05.750> I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
clicking the site and holding shift I

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.310 
clicking the site and holding shift I
can<00:05:06.110> resize<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.950> in<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.730> right<00:05:08.320> proportions

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
can resize it in the right proportions

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.850 
can resize it in the right proportions
and<00:05:09.950> now<00:05:10.630> let's<00:05:11.630> add<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.750> little<00:05:11.930> gravity<00:05:12.350> to

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
and now let's add a little gravity to

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.600 
and now let's add a little gravity to
the<00:05:12.890> scene<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:14.060> we<00:05:14.990> go<00:05:15.170> here<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.680> scene

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
the scene so we go here in the scene

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.630 
the scene so we go here in the scene
area<00:05:17.200> gravity<00:05:19.480> epsilon<00:05:20.480> 500<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.590> think<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.310> okay

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
area gravity epsilon 500 I think is okay

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.140 
area gravity epsilon 500 I think is okay
and<00:05:22.880> then<00:05:23.540> we<00:05:23.630> can<00:05:23.780> test<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.340> BAM<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.669> that's

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
and then we can test it BAM and that's

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.700 
and then we can test it BAM and that's
it<00:05:26.320> my<00:05:27.320> characters<00:05:27.800> falling<00:05:28.190> down<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:30.500> can

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
it my characters falling down so you can

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.240 
it my characters falling down so you can
go<00:05:30.860> on<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.190> edit<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.640> more<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.950> let's<00:05:33.950> add<00:05:34.160> an

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
go on and edit it more so let's add an

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.190 
go on and edit it more so let's add an
actor<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.910> a<00:05:35.270> director<00:05:35.440> call<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.560> ground<00:05:39.880> and

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
actor and a director call it ground and

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.120 
actor and a director call it ground and
we<00:05:42.200> change<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.650> size<00:05:43.270> wise<00:05:44.270> is<00:05:44.660> like<00:05:45.020> say<00:05:45.380> 800

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
we change to size wise is like say 800

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.430 
we change to size wise is like say 800
and<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.550> height<00:05:46.760> is<00:05:46.790> 1<00:05:47.150> pixel<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:50.140> it's<00:05:51.140> not

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
and the height is 1 pixel and it's not

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.640 
and the height is 1 pixel and it's not
movable<00:05:52.130> of<00:05:52.490> course<00:05:53.080> we<00:05:54.080> go<00:05:54.230> back<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.440> the

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
movable of course we go back to the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.659 
movable of course we go back to the
scene<00:05:54.919> I<00:05:55.240> at<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.480> ground<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.960> see<00:05:57.430> there<00:05:58.430> it<00:05:58.550> is

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
scene I at the ground to see there it is

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.820 
scene I at the ground to see there it is
very<00:05:59.510> easy<00:05:59.630> and<00:06:00.730> then<00:06:01.730> I<00:06:02.410> go<00:06:03.410> back<00:06:03.530> to<00:06:03.590> the

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
very easy and then I go back to the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.930 
very easy and then I go back to the
character<00:06:04.520> creator<00:06:05.390> rule<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:06.010> if<00:06:07.010> the

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
character is colliding with the actor

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.159 
character is colliding with the actor
