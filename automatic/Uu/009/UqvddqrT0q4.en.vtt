00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
you know you just have to be mindful of

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.780 
you know you just have to be mindful of
the<00:03:41.170> fact<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.620> you're<00:03:42.069> still<00:03:42.250> never<00:03:42.490> able<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
the fact that you're still never able to

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.940 
the fact that you're still never able to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
mean you shouldn't have any safety

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.790 
mean you shouldn't have any safety
concerns<00:03:46.300> or<00:03:46.870> anything<00:03:47.050> like<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.770> I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
concerns or anything like that so I

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.010 
concerns or anything like that so I
