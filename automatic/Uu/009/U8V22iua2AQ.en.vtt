00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
has been cultivated pretty good and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.770 
has been cultivated pretty good and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
looking for maybe on a wild goose chase
looking<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.559> arrowhead<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.040> he<00:01:02.129> thinks

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
looking for the arrowhead that he thinks

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
looking for the arrowhead that he thinks
he<00:01:02.580> might<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.909> seen<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> other<00:01:04.949> thing

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
he might have seen and the other thing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
he might have seen and the other thing
that<00:01:05.189> gets<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.670> interest<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.130> he

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that gets my interest is you know if he

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.670 
that gets my interest is you know if he
saw<00:01:08.460> an<00:01:08.550> arrowhead<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.240> tractor<00:01:09.680> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
saw an arrowhead from the tractor it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.620 
saw an arrowhead from the tractor it
probably<00:01:11.160> wasn't<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.640> small<00:01:11.880> Arrowhead<00:01:13.310> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
probably wasn't a small Arrowhead and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.830 
probably wasn't a small Arrowhead and
this<00:01:15.630> ground<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.010> bleached

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
this ground is really really bleached

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
this ground is really really bleached
white<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> had<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> been<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
white so it would have had to been a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
white so it would have had to been a
contrast<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:21.690> thinking<00:01:22.050> really<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.320> dark

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
contrast I'm thinking really a dark

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080 
contrast I'm thinking really a dark
Arrowhead<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.040> maybe<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> bright<00:01:23.880> white

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
Arrowhead or maybe just a bright white

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.730 
Arrowhead or maybe just a bright white
Arrowhead<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:27.200> hopefully<00:01:28.200> you'll<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.620> see

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:13.319 

like<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> piece<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.200> Nelly<00:04:05.100> shirt

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.250 

interesting<00:04:14.329> when<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.480> got<00:04:14.659> home<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:14.989> cleaned

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
interesting when I got home and cleaned

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.029 
interesting when I got home and cleaned
it<00:04:15.379> up<00:04:15.469> I<00:04:15.650> noticed<00:04:15.859> that<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:18.139> had<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> fossil

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
it up I noticed that this had a fossil

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:26.170 
it up I noticed that this had a fossil
in<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:22.389> there<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:25.160> think<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.910> little<00:04:26.000> bit

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
in it there and I think a little bit

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.290 
in it there and I think a little bit
right<00:04:26.360> there<00:04:27.639> so<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.880> might<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.180> been<00:04:29.240> a

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
right there so that might have been a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.969 
right there so that might have been a
hard<00:04:29.509> piece<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.930> work<00:04:30.080> with<00:04:30.349> I<00:04:30.530> notice<00:04:30.830> that

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
hard piece to work with I notice that

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.350 
hard piece to work with I notice that
they've<00:04:31.160> got<00:04:32.470> little<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.949> stack<00:04:34.360> Flint

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
they've got little bit of stack Flint

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.200 
they've got little bit of stack Flint
right<00:04:35.630> here<00:04:37.240> it's<00:04:38.240> thing<00:04:38.449> is<00:04:38.570> pretty<00:04:39.229> thin<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
right here it's thing is pretty thin the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.230 
right here it's thing is pretty thin the
top<00:04:41.479> end<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.099> nicely<00:04:43.099> worked<00:04:45.759> I'm<00:04:46.759> assuming

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
top end of it nicely worked I'm assuming

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.999 
top end of it nicely worked I'm assuming
that's<00:04:47.419> broke<00:04:47.720> but<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.320> know<00:04:48.530> again<00:04:48.800> maybe

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
that's broke but you know again maybe

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.490 
that's broke but you know again maybe
when<00:04:49.280> they<00:04:49.370> got<00:04:49.520> down<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.180> rough<00:04:51.110> area

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
when they got down to that rough area

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.920 
when they got down to that rough area
there<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:52.180> know<00:04:53.180> they<00:04:53.300> just<00:04:53.330> snapped<00:04:53.720> that

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
there you know they just snapped that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.779 
there you know they just snapped that
and<00:04:54.110> used<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.500> more<00:04:54.710> instead<00:04:55.070> of<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.250> half<00:04:55.490> dead

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
and used it more instead of a half dead

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.930 
and used it more instead of a half dead
piece<00:04:56.690> maybe<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> was<00:04:57.169> just<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.500> handheld<00:04:57.949> type

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
piece maybe it was just a handheld type

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.390 
piece maybe it was just a handheld type
of<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.210> knife<00:05:03.820> okay<00:05:04.820> well<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.570> probably<00:05:06.400> walked

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
of a knife okay well I probably walked
