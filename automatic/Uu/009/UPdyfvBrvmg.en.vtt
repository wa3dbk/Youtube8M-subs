00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
successful day whoops two more to go my

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.689 
successful day whoops two more to go my
reserves<00:06:05.379> are<00:06:05.589> starting<00:06:05.949> to<00:06:05.979> get<00:06:06.129> full<00:06:06.400> but<00:06:06.610> I

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
reserves are starting to get full but I

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.279 
reserves are starting to get full but I
think<00:06:06.939> that's<00:06:07.150> good<00:06:07.419> because<00:06:07.629> I<00:06:07.839> got<00:06:08.139> to

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
think that's good because I got to

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.339 
think that's good because I got to
believe<00:06:08.819> that<00:06:09.819> positional<00:06:10.629> collections<00:06:11.169> are

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
believe that positional collections are

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.409 
believe that positional collections are
not<00:06:11.560> too<00:06:11.830> far<00:06:12.069> away<00:06:12.099> and<00:06:12.639> it's<00:06:12.849> good<00:06:13.089> to<00:06:13.240> have<00:06:13.360> a

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
not too far away and it's good to have a

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.350 
not too far away and it's good to have a
lot<00:06:13.750> of<00:06:13.779> cards<00:06:14.199> in<00:06:14.379> your<00:06:14.469> reserves<00:06:15.180> for<00:06:16.180> the

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
lot of cards in your reserves for the

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.230 
lot of cards in your reserves for the
positional<00:06:16.930> collections<00:06:17.699> no<00:06:18.699> I<00:06:18.729> don't<00:06:19.060> need

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
positional collections no I don't need

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.959 
positional collections no I don't need
that<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:19.930> got<00:06:20.529> a<00:06:20.560> collectible<00:06:21.219> I<00:06:21.310> don't<00:06:21.729> think

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
that I got a collectible I don't think

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.550
