00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.979
 good 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.800
 in xataka we were able to try the new 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.110
 canon eos m3 the third generation of 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.450
 without the manufacturer's mirrors with a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.580
 24 megapixel sensor processor 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.769
 digic 6 and an autofocusing system 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.689
 rather improved offers us the 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.669
 expected yield of canon at the level of 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.679
 image with a significant improvement 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.869
 compared to previous versions 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.449
 design has also changed now is more 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.699
 successful and competitive thanks to some 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.590
 compact dimensions a good grip that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.120
 improves grip and a weight more than 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.210
 suitable on the top 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.219
 we found the new retractable flash one 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.649
 shoe for accessories like a viewfinder 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.140
 electronic and the different vials for 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.480
 the choice of compensation mode more 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.489
 another for control by the button 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.890
 shot the screen is another of the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.559
 Flip-up highlights and with 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.789
 tactile capabilities offers a very 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 good use experience 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.230
 the most critical and expected section of 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.750
 this camera was to know how it worked 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.550
 your given hybrid auto-focus system 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.280
 the poor reception of the first generation 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.260
 this time Canon has made the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 homework and we like the performance of 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.610
 this system of approach that has 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.610
 phase detection pixels in the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 own sensor plus 49 points to efe 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 also with the help of focus picking 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.920
 in manual focus the results are 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.200
 quite satisfactory a good job 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.020
 made here by canon that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.299
 makes forget the first the my and puts it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.549
 in a more competitive situation of 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.350
 it's not the fastest system anyway 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.490
 of focus so they will have to follow 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 working 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.829
 Too bad the lack of options 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.750
 specific optics for this mount 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.310
 we could get much more out of him but 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 those that Canon offers are quite 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.720
 limited therefore the only solution 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.789
 for the moment it is to resort to the use of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 adapters to take advantage of the broad 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.689
 range of canon objectives in terms of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.940
 Burst speed and lethargy 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.330
 between shots is where we find the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.400
 weakest point of this those m3 just 4 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 frames per second with focus on the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.630
 first shot turn it into a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 model not very appropriate for scenes of 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.940
 action also has a very marked lac 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.370
 / shot shot that makes it not 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.830
 completely satisfactory in terms of 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 performance we can not fault 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.700
 The sensor offers a very good quality 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 of good image color reproduction and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.290
 good noise management in high 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 sensitivities 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.950
 Finally the camera offers different 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.140
 connectivity options like nfc or 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.630
 wifi that will allow us to go to the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.540
 photographs from the camera to a smartphone 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.540
 or even be able to control it from 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 remote way a pretty option 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 interesting 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 in conclusion it has good quality of 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 image if it's a good camera if the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.900
 We can recommend it is true that 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.580
 take the canon and it's in a camera 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 channel awaits us a lot more has 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.690
 arrived very late to the sector of the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.300
 cameras without a mirror and good this model 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.550
 in a way it compensates and 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.110
 and it offers a very interesting model 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.630
 but he still has a lot of room for 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.000
 improvement in video in burst speed 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.820
 in other aspects what we find 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.410
 still so competitive but if it is 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.360
 recommended is a camera with a good 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.010
 image quality but we hope that in 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.860
 the following canon models then of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.600
 age of the breast crime or get more 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.650
 optical and really already a camera in the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.480
 that if I did not fully fall in love 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 Well, this is all we can 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.400
 comment on the canon eos m3 and we hope 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.189
 eager to find a next model 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.689
 in which we really surprised 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.470
 that we see in the next video 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.470
 someone takes pictures
