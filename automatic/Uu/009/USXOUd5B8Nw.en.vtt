00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.220
 nobody knows if Carlos Lobatón is a 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.259
 specialist in free throws need 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 the advice of the technical assistant of the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.610
 Peruvian soccer team fpf not what 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 defeated solano the selection was prepared 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.780
 to face tonight at the stadium 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.759
 national to mexico some friendly match 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.310
 that will serve a lot of food to get 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.499
 well attached to the American Cup not of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 true that the only day that separates them 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.179
 free throw is lovato there is not well all the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.039
 boy standing time 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.199
 You saw not practicing pica the bug 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.829
 but now we are happy that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.850
 be a variant that there must be 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.079
 options that have options because 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 it is also an important part today 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.750
 of soccer a ball for a team 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.820
 organized a hard team sort that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 he speculates a lot that they have left a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.659
 team to play there in another 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.550
 tournament but we want at the moment 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.460
 do it obviously ricardo wants to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260
 prepare the match for the day that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 will also do with Brazil paolo 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 stolen trusting staying intact in the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.939
 workouts and friendly matches 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.259
 has been taken into account by the technician 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.310
 ricardo gareca of us and is what 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.930
 what we always have to be 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.939
 thinking of expressing in us not in the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 so we know we have to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.469
 be a good job for me and I think that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 we are all to play I do not think that 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:26.360
 we all do our job but what 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.090
 that hopes to shine in the america cup is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.539
 says that Gareca expects a lot from Sanchez 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.880
 Well, it's a polite balancer. 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:44.009
 has asked for a lot of touch of the ball and get 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 with walls or ball flush with 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.700
 I think that's what we 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.930
 we must do 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.930
 and let's hope that tomorrow we keep it in 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.310
 Acanceh a lot of press went to 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.799
 the last practice of the selection 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.320
 Peruvian football and even journalists 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.810
 Mexicans arrived to observe the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.390
 practice of the tigers of gareca juan 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.220
 Manuel Vargas and André Carrillo already 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 they integrated the combined but not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.780
 they lent statements neither claudio 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.150
 pizarro ni paolo guerrero are already 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.190
 complete the fantastic ones now just 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.709
 subtract that they demonstrate on the court their 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.250
 football conditions first before 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.500
 mexico and then in the cup america will play 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.480
 very the fantastic four against mexico 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.480
 the answer has it gareca 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 single
