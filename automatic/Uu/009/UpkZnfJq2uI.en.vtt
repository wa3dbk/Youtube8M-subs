00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello everybody and sic the first tutorial 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.330
 I want to pass some things on to you. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.310
 that I learned in these the beginner in the area 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.029
 but with great fishermen 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.080
 of the region the bataguassú sauce learned 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.100
 I'm pretty much here at the river's edge 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.990
 paraná on the lake of the Sérgio Motta 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.629
 is a pretty good course that she calls 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 berth on it a licit berth 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.610
 vessel to the tax office when it was 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 very cool already have some tucunarés 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.430
 here I want to pass on to you the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:52.489
 I use the medicine girl, right? 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.489
 is a reel or using adventure in the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 marine very good 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.460
 I read multiply not recommend it for that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.940
 She still works with her, too. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 very strong not exist but also it 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.320
 usually in kawasaki and ended up creating 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.979
 more truck driver than usual 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.920
 normal also the wig o protects 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.109
 the lagoon I'm using a meter and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 Thirty-five 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.570
 It's very good, this fashion is light and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.270
 The bait works well the country but today I 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.509
 step for you here I use for 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 fishing with neymar and also how I use the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.780
 use with the generator and also with the inep 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.630
 not also facilitates the placement of the lure 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.299
 so I'll do it for you guys 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.789
 Here's how to knot here so you do not 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.079
 escape from the line and also the hook that the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.420
 use and the sun to lay the lambari because 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.609
 I'm tough and it works very well. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.450
 the lambari alive right? 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:04.790
 which fits the nose is tetra 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 in this profile that does not disturb 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.800
 you can not work right mokoena 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 he works harder and draws the attention of the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.900
 tucunaré and so it attacks much more 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 easy or how to pass for a man who 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:25.630
 now the question of the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 waugh easy to make and resistant too 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:37.960
 I know that next time you pick up your line 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.960
 You'll pull it and sense it here. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.100
 game bit so reasonable not even 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 on some sc will cut who makes if 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.810
 passes on your generator 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:07.520
 The final show here dies. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.430
 this 900 ac pull the second that will be 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.080
 thrown on the tip and passed inep 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.500
 the generator that went in and pulls in here 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.830
 to help and junk lock balls 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.830
 cushion 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.010
 this is something cool cool huh 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.900
 I'll escape me see if I am wanted 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.880
 exaggerated an audience I did not learn like this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.080
 but I give one more winner 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.810
 I 'm more human still gets the blue 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.850
 of four kilos and will escape and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.740
 It happens and I believe it, because 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:51.910
 they know our way right 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.910
 the fisherman already knows, I'll do even more 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.230
 up here and not let the bluebird of 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:06.430
 four capo movies after you go with 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.430
 No team will believe this line 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:30.860
 Hard, beauty, I now put it blaming the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:33.590
 misplaced sun is caught beauty 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.400
 summon the bay now agree floors 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.610
 the lambari 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.530
 Looks just the size of this lambari lambari 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.930
 average in my region 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.070
 second to attack legal new middle and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.290
 works with the weight of the generator imepi 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.720
 the hook does not get in the way he works 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.190
 so let's put it here analyzed 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:59.990
 in this sense because he does not reason 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.120
 the fish's nose is not right 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.629
 lambari 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.720
 Hey, he's cool, right? 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:12.800
 here is done 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.979
 come on, something else too 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.039
 interesting is the device took off a 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.810
 irregular barista because he did it 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:34.080
 a different noise 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:50.639
 seemed to wake up the good because no more 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:51.719
 to have played here tried to move from the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.370
 tucunaré 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.919
 we are here bataguassú no mato grosso 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.039

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.169
 to be able to help you also had fun 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.710
 fun you can fish in which the 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.050
 head have fun with more leisurely otavio 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.699
 mosque in the corner and fishing too 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.990
