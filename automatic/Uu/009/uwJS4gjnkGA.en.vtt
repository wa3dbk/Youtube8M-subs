 white cover the ingredients that we 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 are two cups wheat flour 1 cup 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.469
 We're going to use a can of milk. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.960
 condensed 100 grams of chocolate into 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.579

 we will also use white granules 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 these are the ingredients we're going to use 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.449
 for our today's revenue 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.210
 first I turn off the oven 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 raise the temperature to 180 degrees to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.750
 heating 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 in a bowl we'll sift the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 wheat flour 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 we pondered the wheat flour for 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.760
 March will get more loose 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.020
 We put it in sugar now we put it on 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.979
 milk powder and butter or chocolate 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.400

 mix all the ingredients in 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 which is integrated with the environment 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 now we'll sieve the three gems 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 this film here is that O is the smell 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.869
 egg 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 Now we're going to be stirring here with the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.150
 help of a whisk to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.490
 a homogeneous fine dough 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 here we are like this, now we 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.380
 we beat the egg whites 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.649
 to wear a coast kick 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.430
 It was like this and I'm on my feet because dorin 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.900

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 now we'll put it in the clear 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.740
 snowballs in the mass that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.940
 we did 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.770
 we mix slowly now before 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 put the yeast we'll fight the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.790
 form that from the moment that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.570
