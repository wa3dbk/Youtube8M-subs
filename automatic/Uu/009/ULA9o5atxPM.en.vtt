00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 and we go camping 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 it was a lovely weekend and that I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.210
 I was very excited because he was going to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.210
 field 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.619
 sure you can not wait 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.080
 and fell 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.330
 and nothing 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.809
 what's up with you rossi 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:57.670
 it's true that I do not either 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.550
 here you are where is it fell to a 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 technical paradita 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.390
 size 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.160
 we are running again if there is 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 get back on the road though thinking it 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.070
 Well, what's the matter, darling, I think I'm going to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.070
 take advantage of me 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 is that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.960
 it's an elk crossing sign in these 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.460
 forests there are many moose and so the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.540
 drivers know they have to have 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 hello care 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.710
 needing 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.320
 well do not make many illusions that 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.810
 I so why not because elk are very 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.150
 timid that seemed a bit strange 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.750
 that such a big animal could be so 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.750
 shy 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.790
 climb a mountain that you would like 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.250
 do first it seems to me that it's going to be a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.800
 little complicated elk do not come close 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.810
 to people at least we have never 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.980
 seen one in the camp you do not think 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.980
 if we lend a hand 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.660
 but 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 is 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.150
 and you 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.180
 or in work fell 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.940
 you're going to get in there that I do go 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.680
 what's wrong, cielito? 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.690
 come, it's great, go for the water 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.480
 they are calm kaiju fish have more 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.840
 fear them of you that you of them 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.890
 one was very sure of wanting to swim 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.890
 he is very deep 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.090
 deep 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.080
 you will not want to splash me 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 as soon as he fell he got into the water 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.250
 he lost his fear 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.480
 and without realizing it came time to 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.129
 dined they wanted to smell 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.129
 I could eat a horse 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.730
 I would eat an elk 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.750
 mine 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.750
 not a squirrel outside plays 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.930
 d 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.080
 do not feed the wild animals 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.039
 skyu because they have to look for their 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.039
 food in the forest 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.830

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.830

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.370
 all right 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.370

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.550

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.550
 when he slipped but wanted to prove to 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.569
 dad how brave was we almost have 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.569

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.230

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.490

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.250
 come guys to bed 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.250
 in the caravan everything is ready 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.949
 It will be fun to sleep outdoors 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.259
 good as you want here I was 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.220
 delighted to sleep in the hammock in the 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.220
 arms of his father 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.830
 good night happy dreams and that is 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.830
 respect the sayings 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.950
 Caius was impressed with the moose 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.730
 never had an animal been seen so 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.730
 big 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.120
 for me 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.259
 do not go 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.180
 we have to be very quiet 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.180
 remember the aces are very shy 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.280
 it's disgusting 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.280
 plus 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.240
 A) Yes 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.720
 it seemed very funny to him that a 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.910
 such a large animal could be scared of 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.910
 a girl as tiny as rossi
