00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello I am eva villar today we are going to perform 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.300
 a very simple hairstyle to go out 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.009
 the night based on twisted braid 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.769
 that you can do perfectly 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.150
 house is worth it and I'll explain it in two 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.460
 or three simple steps to get the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.830
 the effect of this mane and texture 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.020
 what have we applied 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 a conditioner without rinse of auxi 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.900
 look with richards 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 all you have to do is 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.810
 apply it with damp hair and not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.760
 clarify it 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.720
 then you can dry your hair and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.700
 effect is very polished and very bright 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.180
 to perform this hairstyle we are going to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.850
 separate the hair into two sections this 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 is the most important part of the section 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.110
 number one would go 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.850
 from the lower part of the temple on the side 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.949
 diagonally opposite 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 to the middle of the ear 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 all this part we are going to leave it towards 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.430
 forward and the back that will go 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.370
 in a low ponytail 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.770
 directly, we will hold it with a 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.260
 rubber so it does not bother us and we can 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 work well with the rest of the hair 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.490
 to perform this hairstyle we are going to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.350
 separate the hair into two sections is the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 most important part so then the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 work remains nice and fits well the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.730
 first one goes from the lowest part of the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.350
 temple to half the ear 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.450
 we separate we leave it forward and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.310
 with the rest of the hair we are going to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.310
 pick it up in a low ponytail 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.360
 the top part we're going to start 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.100
 braid the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.350
 just like we do any braid 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.149
 normal separating three finite tufts 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.149
 that are as thick as the three 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.330
 and instead of twisting it up 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 let's braid down let's go 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.410
 grabbing strands to help us 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.490
 that the braid is becoming more and more 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.490
 thick what do we want 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 ah 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.810
 we always leave the bangs part 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.180
 loose so that later it becomes more natural 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 we braid until all the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.190
 personal down to the bottom of the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 same way 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.140
 efe 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.340
 soon 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.020
 Y 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.020
 Y 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.950
 below we hold the braid with a rubber band 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.620
 tiny little elastic and now 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.049
 comes the time the trick that this is 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.090
 the trick of this hairstyle which is to thicken 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.610
 the braid that we have made so that it is 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.299
 bigger and for this starting from 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.750
 up let's say a little bit of the locks and 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.750
 we open them 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.620
 i 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.980
 do not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.829
 Y 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.739
 open 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.650
 we use it to surround the ballot that 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.510
 we have done at the beginning when finished 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.510
 all the hair we hide the rubber 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.700
 we hold you with hairpins 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.299
 so you do not see the line of 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.299
 separation 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.500
 na 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.229
 the lock that we have used 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.750
 left separate from the front 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.389
 from the head we are going to use it now 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.969
 to give a more natural look to the 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.419
 final part 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.419
 we have rotated 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.130
 pull only a little hair to 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.130
 apply it 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.419
 and we would have the hairstyle finished
