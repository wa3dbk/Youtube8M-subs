00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
here's the flying wing with

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.160 
here's the flying wing with
stabilization<00:00:06.450> actually<00:00:07.230> running<00:00:07.500> through

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
stabilization actually running through

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.980 
stabilization actually running through
the<00:00:10.519> dragon<00:00:11.519> OSD<00:00:12.120> version<00:00:12.540> -<00:00:14.450> so<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.750> actually

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the dragon OSD version - so it actually

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:31.130 
the dragon OSD version - so it actually

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
has other cables right here running over

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
has other cables right here running over
to<00:00:31.349> power<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.920> guy<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.520> said<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.360> taking

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to power of this guy I said I'm taking

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
to power of this guy I said I'm taking
this<00:00:33.719> extra<00:00:34.140> cable<00:00:34.469> off<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.160> goes<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this extra cable off and goes to the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.830 
this extra cable off and goes to the
rudder<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:37.340> don't<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.350> won't<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.100> too<00:00:44.280> much

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
rudder I don't so I won't do too much

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.400 
rudder I don't so I won't do too much
but<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.200> rest<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.809> set<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.960> right<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
but the rest of it set up right now I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:17.950 
but the rest of it set up right now I
have<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:51.320> very<00:00:52.489> basic<00:00:53.489> mix<00:00:55.820> control

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.840 

okay<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:21.409> basic<00:01:22.010> controls<00:01:22.340> right<00:01:22.549> now<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.729> have

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
okay so basic controls right now I have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.000 
okay so basic controls right now I have
channel<00:01:23.180> 3<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.600> set<00:01:23.780> up<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:25.090> stabilization

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
channel 3 just set up for stabilization

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.109 
channel 3 just set up for stabilization
stabilization<00:01:28.010> home<00:01:29.830> stabilization<00:01:30.830> off<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
stabilization home stabilization off and

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:46.590 
stabilization home stabilization off and
now<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:35.270> doesn't<00:01:35.570> do<00:01:35.720> anything<00:01:37.780> turn<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.899> on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.669 

stabilize<00:01:47.600> these<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:50.289> let's<00:01:51.289> see<00:01:51.470> how<00:01:51.530> this

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
stabilize these so let's see how this

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.290 
stabilize these so let's see how this
does<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:52.250> got<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.509> finish<00:01:53.509> up<00:01:53.660> this<00:01:53.780> plane<00:01:55.300> get

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
does just got a finish up this plane get

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.600 
does just got a finish up this plane get
some<00:01:56.479> gear<00:01:56.690> mounted<00:01:56.899> on<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.940> test<00:01:58.940> out<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.300> CG

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
some gear mounted on it test out the CG

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.900 
some gear mounted on it test out the CG
missing<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.700> big<00:02:01.940> part<00:02:02.450> here<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:03.050> motor<00:02:03.910> so

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
missing a big part here the motor so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.170 
missing a big part here the motor so
let's<00:02:05.750> see<00:02:05.869> how<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.020> goes
