register user function I've checked to

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.120 
register user function I've checked to
see<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.350> their<00:00:19.800> key<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.039> valid<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.750> I<00:00:21.750> have

tried to add their add the user to the
database<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:27.260> guess<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:28.830> thing<00:00:28.920> we

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
database I guess the first thing we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.560 
database I guess the first thing we
should<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> test<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.330> sure<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
should do is test this to make sure it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.850 
should do is test this to make sure it
works<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> we'll<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:34.469> refresh

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
model I'm trying to insert it into the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
model I'm trying to insert it into the
user<00:01:05.930> table<00:01:06.930> instead<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> user's<00:01:07.979> table

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
user table instead of the user's table

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.450 
user table instead of the user's table
so<00:01:09.240> let's<00:01:09.299> try<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:09.920> I'll<00:01:10.920> save<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so let's try again I'll save that and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.109 
so let's try again I'll save that and
refresh<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
refresh it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.469 
refresh it
it<00:01:12.600> says<00:01:12.840> success<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:15.000> assume<00:01:15.090> now

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it says success so we would assume now

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.499 
it says success so we would assume now
that<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.930> temp<00:01:16.170> temp<00:01:16.650> user's<00:01:17.090> table<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.390> be

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that the temp temp user's table would be

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
that the temp temp user's table would be
empty<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.680> deleted<00:01:19.920> yep<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
empty because it was deleted yep so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.100 
empty because it was deleted yep so
there's<00:01:21.090> no<00:01:21.210> entries<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
actually in the main controller instead

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.260 
actually in the main controller instead
of<00:01:42.060> echoing<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.509> success<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:45.000> we'll<00:01:45.119> do

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270

of echoing out success so what we'll do
is<00:01:45.299> we'll<00:01:45.509> make<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.960> data<00:01:46.350> array<00:01:47.479> Dave<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
is we'll make it a data array Dave that

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.740 
is we'll make it a data array Dave that
go<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.710> array<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.950> we'll<00:01:56.070> say<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> email

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
go to array and then we'll say the email

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.310 
go to array and then we'll say the email
is<00:01:57.750> equal<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:59.240> well<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.200> have

double check members yeah perfect now we
have<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.209> problem<00:02:57.630> though<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.739> actually

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
have a problem though is we actually

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.160 
have a problem though is we actually
don't<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.730> their<00:02:59.940> email<00:03:00.180> address<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.630> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
don't have their email address and so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.960 
don't have their email address and so
what<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.620> would<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.130> do<00:03:02.250> normally<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
what we would have to do normally is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.940 
what we would have to do normally is
query<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> database<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.140> create<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> new

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
query the database and create a new

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.350 
query the database and create a new
function<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.640> model<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.090> will<00:03:06.209> just

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
function in the model that will just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360 
function in the model that will just
grab<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> user<00:03:06.870> data<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.739> we<00:03:07.830> don't<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.190> to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
grab the user data but we don't have to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.640 
grab the user data but we don't have to
in<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.510> case<00:03:09.690> when<00:03:09.930> we're<00:03:10.050> locking<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.530> in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
in this case when we're locking them in

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.979 
in this case when we're locking them in
all<00:03:10.860> we<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.459> grab<00:03:11.610> their<00:03:12.600> email

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
all we have to do is grab their email

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.289 
all we have to do is grab their email
address<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.280> access<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.850> their

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
address and we have access to their

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.850 
address and we have access to their
email<00:03:15.420> address<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.170> data<00:03:16.380> array<00:03:16.680> right

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
email address in this data array right

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.270 
email address in this data array right
here<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.030> instead<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.360> returning<00:03:18.690> true<00:03:19.280> it's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
here so instead of returning true it's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
here so instead of returning true it's
actually<00:03:20.610> return<00:03:21.019> well

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
actually return well

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.470 
actually return well
data<00:03:22.760> email<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.239> send

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
data email so that's going to send

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.740 
data email so that's going to send
essentially<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.829> email<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.209> value<00:03:30.510> for

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
essentially the email of the value for

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.410 
essentially the email of the value for
email<00:03:31.340> which<00:03:32.340> will<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.820> email<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.269> we're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
email which will be the email that we're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.750 
email which will be the email that we're
actually<00:03:33.620> deleting<00:03:34.620> from<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.250> temp<00:03:35.430> users

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
actually deleting from the temp users

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.729 
actually deleting from the temp users
database<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.959> adding<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.440> users

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
database and adding to the users

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.300 
database and adding to the users
database<00:03:38.359> which<00:03:39.359> will<00:03:39.510> work<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.720> fine<00:03:40.310> so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
database which will work just fine so

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.539 
database which will work just fine so
instead<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.680> actually<00:03:43.709> need<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.340> set

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
instead of this we actually need to set

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.340 
instead of this we actually need to set
this<00:03:44.670> equal<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.090> value<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.660> we'll<00:03:45.720> say<00:03:45.900> new

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
this equal to a value so we'll say new

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.210 
this equal to a value so we'll say new
email<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:49.709> new<00:03:50.040> new<00:03:50.519> email<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.000> equal<00:03:51.329> to

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
email if new new email is equal to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.979 
email if new new email is equal to
except<00:03:53.220> from<00:03:53.370> setting<00:03:53.850> new<00:03:54.090> email<00:03:54.450> equal<00:03:54.810> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
except from setting new email equal to
