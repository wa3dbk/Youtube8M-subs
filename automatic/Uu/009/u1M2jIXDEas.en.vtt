 raw material reactions 24 hours 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.880

 of cfd forex since 1989 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 hi it's raft voice the video of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.420
 updates for the cac the gold and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.950
 money money yes because sorry 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810
 it's a little late so I'll do 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.430
 the three videos together so that's fine 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.930
 to be a little bit long especially I 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.989
 have to specify two three little things 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.050
 first of all there is always 5 trad to 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 nothing that ordered fascicles and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.970
 who did not tell me what they wanted 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 that is to say that I received the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.100
 order but not the number two 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.050
 fascicles so if you still have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.570
 not received your order very well done 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.100
 that you replied to the mails that I 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 have you sent and if I have not you 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.120
 send mails do not hesitate to me 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.540
 contact and 1to and 2to emmanuel not 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.890
 automated so sometimes I pass 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.509
 one or two orders ok so do not hesitate 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.820
 not to come back to me if you have 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.990
 ordered and you have not received anything 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.510
 So here is now room for the cac 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.090
 then start the cac we gratified 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.060
 a very nice session today that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.400
 actually confirmed a no more no less 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.950
 that the pattern the Japanese candlestick in 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.590
 China side up that I that I mentioned 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.330
 yesterday I had a little it will be clear here 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.100
 so I said that when we had 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 this configuration statistically 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.159
 had an increase thereafter the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.100
 recipe well took place have the same 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.540
 look for them at 8 5% in session 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.270
 and we see that the rise has come 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.300
 stop fenced below a level 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.460
 of fibonacci very important the 61 8% of 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.990
 retracement Fibonacci light of 1 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.480
 if we take the whole downward wave 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.400
 that there was between June 17 and 24 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.650
 June we did well in stages 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 First of all, we came to fight on the 23 26 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.420
 % consult the 50 % level is 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 today in closing under 61.6 years 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.750
 it's pretty normal these hesitations 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.890
 especially as we approach a gap 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.980
 pretty important here that was opened b 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 between the session of June 19th and June 20th 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.790
 normal that some have decided to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.130
 to get out of the position then also 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.600
 at the level of the technical indicators 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 seems to be improving look rather 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.230
 the zoned stochastic that comes out of 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.850
 his area of over-buying I did my 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.800
 webinar world later and there on 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.590
 I did not go back it was a sign 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.080
 precursor the ma ced always under his 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.750
 signal and the coat but negative 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.030
 which brings me to the video of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 day which is important enough for this 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 tutorial since you are going to see it we have 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.330
 something that is quite rare that gets 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.700
 produces a hidden divergence on 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.320
 indicators so if you follow my 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.030
 videos for a little while you know 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.500
 that all the tools do not favor me 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 and some only have others and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.320
 especially the discrepancies hidden on 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.330
 the indicator 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.070
 so what is it all about 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.959
 knows the divergence on indicators 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.150
 I speak well the discrepancy hide 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.040
 imagine that you have the courses of 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.750
 action that is an action or cac 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.390
 or anything that has evolved from 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.950
 way and that at the same time you have a 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.140
 indicator this is the moment tom 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 stochastic where om has yielded that evolves 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.640
 in this way as you can the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.510
 to note we did not do any higher 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.209
 on the cac where the indicator there during 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.370
 that on the indicator is well we were doing 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.930
 well and above that it's called a 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.030
 divergence hide so why does that want 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 say that these are the indicators or 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.290
 the indicator here mill mill force 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.110
 as much as he can to do more 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.120
 high but the short him did not know how to undermine 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.410
 a bearish divergence hide I 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.150
 nothing and usually behind that makes 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.890
 badaboum a young is spotted in 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.600
 November on the layer look well 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.580
 the indicator here the m gave in 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.590
 the occurrence of the highest on the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.519
 short we had no higher and 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.620
 behind boom 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.180
 immediate punishment is very dangerous 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.530
 of dividend a bearish divergence 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.480
 much more than differences 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.350
 standard obviously it works too 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.660
 on the rise 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.510
 when you have a course that evolve from 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.690
 such way while the tom moment 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.060
 stochastic oulÃ©mas cv evolved from such 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.460
 other as you can see here 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.210
 the indicator does not make new 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.350
 lower here we are lower than here so 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.790
 we do not make new lows 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.400
 however, the indicator did 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.440
 lower is called a divergence 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.130
 bullish hide then perennial generals 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.930
 on the cac 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.460
 look here we did a lower but 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.330
 sure the case we did not do more 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.270
 low behind 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.130
 badaboum leaves rather hop hop hop here 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.990
 up then if I talk about it 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.820
 of course it's not for nothing 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.479
 it's because look at what's going on 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.360
 currently going on the tom moment 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.430
 this is then you zoom in for good 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.840
 understand what's going on look at it 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.840
 makes a higher on the moment tom 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.760
 between this point and this point the bank 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.130
 to figure it will be simpler 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.020
 and when we look at what happened 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.120
 a time on the central courts is 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.160
 the point ben it's clear we do not have 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.630
 made above so be careful 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.490
 it's super dangerous what's going on 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.200
 currently and what strengthens me in 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.910
 the idea that 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.100
 that what we are witnessing to what 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.170
 we are currently attending is a is 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.910
 a simple technical rebound a gift that one 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.530
 can always invalidate the divergence 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.210
 bearish hiding just do a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.160
 higher on the indicator is on the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.280
 short that is to say go higher than 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.600
 the previous higher on the on the on 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.780
 the cac but for now it's not the 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.570
 case 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.710
 so here to make it simple yes ben 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.710
 it's good we can even get 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.990
 the m20 but be careful we still have 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.430
 not done more far away so 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.460
 we are really under threat always 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.710
 from this shoulder head and possibly 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.900
 second shoulder that would be formed 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.110
 without further delay the video on gold and 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.840
 on money so we will start with 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.420
 money denominated in euros so how 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.390
 leave it as we saw yesterday already 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.860
 the bevel because it's not a channel 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.230
 that's a kiss 1 was slightly 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.000
 converge is breaking he has 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.560
 even broken down clearly what 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.810
 is completely against statistics 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.860
 and that shows how much money is 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.920
 adrift 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.450
 so as I yesterday yesterday normally in 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.610
 nine cases over ten years comes out the top 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.260
 flow and kisses to the descendants there in 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.930
 going out from below as in a 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.000
 case in 10 but also as I said 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.870
 yesterday the bright side of things because he 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.730
 have to look for a 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.560
 that's usually when she's 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.980
 atypical output like that in the wake 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.960
 we go back and we go back in the direction 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.600
 traditional after a few sessions 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.710
 good it's already that but otherwise the trend 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.300
 is clearly bearish we are in 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.090
 below the M7 below the ES20 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.260
 good it's clearly apocalyptic a 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.260
 message have already spoken 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.960
 and if we look now at gold 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.320
 denominated in euros then look at it a 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.040
 little bit the day's session we give up 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.570
 2 6% or eat by boring it's rather 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.190
 catastrophic with a same 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.610
 configuration except that the zone of 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.620
 support also exploded the bevel 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.270
 which I talked about yesterday banny too is 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.460
 broken from the bottom but same conclusion 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.140
 that for the money the positive side 6 in 1 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.090
 is that we usually go back to 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.290
 waters afterwards but it was by the 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.360
 for the moment it is still necessary 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.460
 look for a new support area and 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.940
 the next support area you do not 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.700
 you're wrong it's there and 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.270
 good side that is positive is that we 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.950
 it almost rally but it sinks 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.810
 as in butter now there is 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.860
 no one who buys on the market 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:42.050
 paper and so that allows the 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.760
 downward speculation to give free 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.710
 run to his imagination 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.660
 here she wishes a good evening of 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.210
