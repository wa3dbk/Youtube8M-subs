going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> act<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.490> a<00:02:00.180> normal<00:02:00.659> Cydia<00:02:01.020> package

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
going to act as a normal Cydia package

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
going to act as a normal Cydia package
and<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.600> quick<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.409> easy

and it's really quick and really easy
and<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.070> simple<00:02:06.290> now<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.129> my

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and really simple now as you can see my

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
and really simple now as you can see my
other<00:02:09.090> upload<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:10.110> prompt<00:02:10.800> me<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> create

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
other upload has prompt me to create

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790 
other upload has prompt me to create
control<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.840> basically

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
control so basically

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
information and as the previous version

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
information and as the previous version
has<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.200> got<00:02:19.440> optional<00:02:19.950> information<00:02:20.070> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
done creating my control file which is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.680 
done creating my control file which is
really<00:02:37.950> simple<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> easy<00:02:38.610> we'll<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> do

easy quite simple and if we have many

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.870 
easy quite simple and if we have many
conversions<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.250> page<00:03:05.490> where<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.850> can

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
conversions in one page where you can

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.950 
conversions in one page where you can
just<00:03:06.030> close<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.510> rid<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
just close it and get rid of it and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.840 
just close it and get rid of it and
start<00:03:10.560> afresh<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.190> take<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.490> look

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
start afresh so I'm going to take a look

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.680 
start afresh so I'm going to take a look
at<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.540> guts<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.380> deb<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.190> with<00:03:18.090> control

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
at the guts of the deb so with control

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.150 
at the guts of the deb so with control
as<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.250> my<00:03:21.620> my<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.920> guts

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
as you can see it's got my my the guts

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.090 
as you can see it's got my my the guts
of<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.550> zip<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.810> basically<00:03:25.470> app<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
of the zip is basically app the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.970 
of the zip is basically app the
application<00:03:26.700> folder<00:03:27.120> which<00:03:27.709> holds<00:03:28.709> my

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
application folder which holds my

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.340 
application folder which holds my
application<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.360> control<00:03:30.720> folder<00:03:31.170> which

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
application and the control folder which

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.970 
application and the control folder which
basically<00:03:31.830> holds<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.350> information

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
basically holds the the information

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.470 
basically holds the the information
about<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.250> package<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:37.340> without

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
about the package in there and without

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.570 
about the package in there and without
basically<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.830> exactly<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.070> same<00:03:41.310> as

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
basically it's just exactly the same as

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.660 
basically it's just exactly the same as
with<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.630> without<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> control<00:03:43.350> file<00:03:43.590> now<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
with but without a control file now I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.970 
with but without a control file now I
Deb<00:03:45.000> will<00:03:45.209> recognize<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> control<00:03:46.320> file<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
Deb will recognize a control file in the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.150 
Deb will recognize a control file in the
