00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
let me show you early in the game the

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.849 
let me show you early in the game the
low<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.239> time<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.659> very<00:02:25.749> basic<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.560> can

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
low this time is very basic I can

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.589 
low this time is very basic I can
actually<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.249> helpful<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.849> more<00:02:28.060> players<00:02:28.359> to

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
actually be helpful with more players to

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.270 
actually be helpful with more players to
get<00:02:28.719> rid<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.139> enemies<00:02:29.469> and<00:02:29.499> stuff<00:02:29.680> but

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
get rid of the enemies and stuff but

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.309 
get rid of the enemies and stuff but
when<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:30.999> to<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> later<00:02:31.420> stages<00:02:31.749> the

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
when you get to the later stages the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.500 
when you get to the later stages the
little<00:02:32.620> design<00:02:32.769> gets<00:02:33.219> incredibly<00:02:34.090> complex

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
little design gets incredibly complex

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.690 
little design gets incredibly complex
and<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.079> gets<00:02:35.260> very<00:02:35.349> easy<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:36.099> jump<00:02:36.400> on<00:02:36.579> each

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and it gets very easy to jump on each

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.550 
and it gets very easy to jump on each
other's<00:02:37.030> head<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.540> knock<00:02:37.989> each<00:02:38.170> other's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
other's head and knock each other's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.339 
other's head and knock each other's
after<00:02:38.950> platforms<00:02:39.579> into<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:40.060> pit<00:02:40.349> another

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
after platforms into a pit another

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.170 
after platforms into a pit another
annoying<00:02:41.650> thing<00:02:41.829> about<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.340> multiplayer<00:02:42.670> is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
annoying thing about the multiplayer is

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.750 
annoying thing about the multiplayer is
that<00:02:43.540> whenever<00:02:43.780> someone<00:02:44.109> dies<00:02:44.469> gets<00:02:45.159> hurt<00:02:45.489> or

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that whenever someone dies gets hurt or

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.209 
that whenever someone dies gets hurt or
just<00:02:46.090> gets<00:02:46.299> power<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:47.260> game<00:02:47.409> pauses<00:02:47.799> for<00:02:48.189> a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
just gets power the game pauses for a

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.220 
just gets power the game pauses for a
split<00:02:48.459> second<00:02:49.000> which<00:02:49.359> is<00:02:49.389> really<00:02:49.540> annoying

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
split second which is really annoying

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.440 
split second which is really annoying
because<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.829> screws<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.400> my<00:02:51.459> jumps<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.150> makes

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
because it screws up my jumps and makes

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.569 
because it screws up my jumps and makes
me<00:02:52.719> die<00:02:52.930> true<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.889> more<00:02:54.099> players<00:02:54.430> you

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
me die true and the more players you

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.819 
me die true and the more players you
have<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:55.239> worse<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.719> will<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:56.169> but<00:02:56.650> there

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
have the worse it will get but there

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.530 
have the worse it will get but there
also<00:02:56.919> many<00:02:57.280> good<00:02:57.549> things<00:02:57.579> about<00:02:57.969> the<00:02:58.209> coop

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
also many good things about the coop

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.259 
also many good things about the coop
like<00:02:59.139> if<00:02:59.439> one<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.040> die<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.849> will<00:03:00.909> appear

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
like if one of you die you will appear

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.119 
like if one of you die you will appear
in<00:03:01.389> a<00:03:01.449> bubble<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.049> another<00:03:02.469> player<00:03:02.769> has<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
in a bubble and another player has to

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.550 
in a bubble and another player has to
pop<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.639> so<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.299> means<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.750> can't<00:03:05.139> get<00:03:05.319> game

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
pop it so that means you can't get game

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.770 
pop it so that means you can't get game
over<00:03:05.799> unless<00:03:06.370> everyone<00:03:06.969> dies<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.449> the<00:03:07.480> same

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
over unless everyone dies at the same

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
over unless everyone dies at the same
time<00:03:08.139> it's<00:03:08.980> also<00:03:09.159> possible<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.699> enter<00:03:10.120> a

lot of new enemies and obstacles but the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.670 
lot of new enemies and obstacles but the
themes<00:03:22.449> for<00:03:22.659> this<00:03:22.810> game<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.199> very

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
themes for this game are very

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.949 
themes for this game are very
disappointing<00:03:24.459> because<00:03:24.969> it<00:03:25.090> cannot<00:03:25.329> be<00:03:25.449> just

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
disappointing because it cannot be just

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.960 
disappointing because it cannot be just
the<00:03:26.199> same<00:03:26.560> as<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:27.099> YouTube<00:03:27.370> my<00:03:27.549> brother's
