blue<00:01:14.250> yellow<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.820> red<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.660> taken<00:01:15.930> from

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
blue yellow and red we're taken from

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.889 
blue yellow and red we're taken from
that<00:01:16.410> rubik's<00:01:16.920> cube<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.369> placed<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
that rubik's cube and placed on top and

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.870 
that rubik's cube and placed on top and
these<00:01:19.560> whites<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.190> normal<00:01:21.149> to<00:01:21.539> this<00:01:22.050> cube<00:01:22.440> and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
these whites are normal to this cube and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
these whites are normal to this cube and
so<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.509> way<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:25.080> about<00:01:25.410> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.990> don't

so the way to go about this is I don't

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
so the way to go about this is I don't
know<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:29.039> you'd

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
know if this would be something you'd

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300 
know if this would be something you'd
want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> streets<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.560> see

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
want to do in the streets but I see

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
people performing this on stage and I've

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.910

this face until the change happens which

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
this face until the change happens which
is<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.100> simple<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.150> blow<00:01:54.740> shake<00:01:56.030> rotate

several<00:02:25.290> moves<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.010> only<00:02:26.489> did<00:02:26.730> four<00:02:27.120> moves<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
several moves I only did four moves that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.640 
several moves I only did four moves that
I<00:02:28.620> could<00:02:28.890> memorize<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.120> move<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.630> did<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
I could memorize and the move I did that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.150 
I could memorize and the move I did that
works<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:32.190> me<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.579> a<00:02:33.239> called<00:02:34.140> right<00:02:34.590> inverted

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
works for me is a called right inverted

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.520 
works for me is a called right inverted
down<00:02:36.320> left<00:02:37.320> inverted<00:02:37.950> up<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.390> that's<00:02:40.350> just

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
down left inverted up and that's just

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.040 
down left inverted up and that's just
what<00:02:40.680> called<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.640> called<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.720> here

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
what called what is called and from here

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.559 
what called what is called and from here
looks<00:02:43.650> pretty<00:02:43.770> scrambled<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:45.000> granted

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
looks pretty scrambled to me now granted

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.840 
looks pretty scrambled to me now granted
I<00:02:45.690> could<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.260> more<00:02:46.500> detail<00:02:46.739> but

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
I could go in more detail but

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.430 
I could go in more detail but
I<00:02:48.080> chose<00:02:49.080> not<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.540> only<00:02:51.840> other<00:02:52.050> thing

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
I chose not to and the only other thing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.170 
I chose not to and the only other thing
that<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:53.100> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.970> memorize

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that you're going to have to memorize

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.010 
that you're going to have to memorize
from<00:02:55.050> there<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:57.060> position<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.780> whites

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
from there is the position of the whites

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.140 
from there is the position of the whites
once<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> move<00:02:59.100> lock<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.730> because

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
once you get the move lock down because

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.190 
once you get the move lock down because
it's<00:03:00.330> easy<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:01.320> lost<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.860> translation<00:03:02.220> of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it's easy to get lost in translation of

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.010 
it's easy to get lost in translation of
which<00:03:04.200> set<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> cubes<00:03:05.190> are<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.090> let's<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:06.900> with

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
which set the cubes are so let's go with

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.100 
which set the cubes are so let's go with
that<00:03:07.260> standard<00:03:08.870> right<00:03:09.870> inverted<00:03:10.380> down<00:03:12.110> left

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
that standard right inverted down left

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.550 
that standard right inverted down left
and<00:03:13.260> verted<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.210> away<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.780> see<00:03:16.380> this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and verted up so right away I see this

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.400 
and verted up so right away I see this
whole<00:03:16.830> orange<00:03:17.340> bar<00:03:17.610> facing<00:03:18.330> me<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.290> put

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
whole orange bar facing me so I can put

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.860 
whole orange bar facing me so I can put
in<00:03:19.560> any<00:03:19.710> direction<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.370> want<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.180> long<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.630> when

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
in any direction I want so long as when

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.000 
in any direction I want so long as when
I<00:03:21.900> get<00:03:22.170> back<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
I get back to it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.930 
I get back to it
I<00:03:23.040> bring<00:03:23.940> his<00:03:24.120> orange<00:03:24.720> bar<00:03:25.410> back<00:03:25.950> facing<00:03:26.610> me

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
I bring his orange bar back facing me

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.130 
I bring his orange bar back facing me
and<00:03:27.150> then<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.960> just<00:03:28.200> do<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.680> opposite<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:30.140> what

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
and then I just do the opposite of what

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.080 
and then I just do the opposite of what
I<00:03:31.470> did<00:03:31.800> which<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.750> up<00:03:33.750> inverted<00:03:34.730> left<00:03:38.090> down

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
I did which is up inverted left down

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.580 
I did which is up inverted left down
that's<00:03:39.630> down<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.140> other<00:03:40.260> way<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.440> down

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that's down the other way is down

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.470 
that's down the other way is down
inverted<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.610> then<00:03:41.880> right<00:03:43.490> so<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:44.790> then

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
inverted and then right so and then

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.850 
inverted and then right so and then
that's<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:47.100> once<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.090> get<00:03:48.390> an<00:03:48.860> algorithm

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
that's it so once you get an algorithm

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.520 
that's it so once you get an algorithm
or<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.490> set<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> moves<00:03:51.240> that<00:03:51.840> works<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.350> you

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
or a set of moves that works for you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.000 
or a set of moves that works for you
just<00:03:52.880> memorize<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.450> go<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.650> move<00:03:55.830> at<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
just memorize it and go one move at a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.100 
just memorize it and go one move at a
time<00:03:56.190> because<00:03:56.340> easy<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.970> lose<00:03:57.150> track<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.810> this

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
time because easy to lose track of this

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.750 
time because easy to lose track of this
especially<00:03:58.740> if<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.310> know<00:03:59.520> how<00:03:59.700> to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
especially if you don't know how to

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.240 
especially if you don't know how to
solve<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.480> Rubik's<00:04:00.840> Cube<00:04:02.030> you're<00:04:03.030> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.240> be

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
solve a Rubik's Cube you're going to be

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
solve a Rubik's Cube you're going to be
frustrated<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.610> say<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.940> least<00:04:06.120> once<00:04:06.690> you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
frustrated to say the least once you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.130 
frustrated to say the least once you
have<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.290> all<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:08.070> takes<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:09.050> setting<00:04:10.050> your

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
have it all it takes is setting your

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.950 
have it all it takes is setting your
move<00:04:10.860> up<00:04:11.070> your<00:04:11.430> memorization<00:04:11.850> pattern<00:04:12.510> down<00:04:12.660> I

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
move up your memorization pattern down I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.560 
move up your memorization pattern down I
see<00:04:13.620> these<00:04:13.830> three<00:04:14.100> red<00:04:14.430> bars<00:04:14.700> facing<00:04:15.090> me<00:04:15.420> or

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
see these three red bars facing me or

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.750 
see these three red bars facing me or
whatever<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.960> takes<00:04:16.260> -<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.460> to<00:04:17.580> know

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
whatever it takes - for you to know

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.370 
whatever it takes - for you to know
maybe<00:04:18.120> you're<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.480> like<00:04:18.690> oh<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.989> white<00:04:19.170> is

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
maybe you're just like oh the white is

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.050 
maybe you're just like oh the white is
facing<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.010> left<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.489> then<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.850> can

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
facing to the left and then you can

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
facing to the left and then you can
leave<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.570> table<00:04:21.750> or<00:04:22.140> wherever<00:04:22.860> you

leave this on the table or wherever you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.220 
leave this on the table or wherever you

may be leave it out pull it out of the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.870 
may be leave it out pull it out of the
pocket<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.560> go<00:04:28.710> with<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.220> you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
pocket and I like to go with the you

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.430 
pocket and I like to go with the you
know<00:04:30.000> they<00:04:30.120> say<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.360> only<00:04:30.600> takes<00:04:30.900> 20<00:04:31.050> moves

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
know they say it only takes 20 moves

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.170 
know they say it only takes 20 moves
I've<00:04:31.770> seen<00:04:31.980> people<00:04:32.250> tell<00:04:32.370> stories<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.820> where

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
I've seen people tell stories of where

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.970 
I've seen people tell stories of where
they've<00:04:33.360> thrown<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.960> rubik's<00:04:34.410> cube<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.830> in

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
they've thrown the rubik's cube up in

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.310 
they've thrown the rubik's cube up in
the<00:04:35.070> air<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.340> tried<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.610> catch<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.750> story

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
the air and tried to catch it a story

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.590 
the air and tried to catch it a story
that's<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.740> he<00:04:38.220> looked<00:04:38.460> at<00:04:38.610> such<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.850> confused

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
that's like he looked at such a confused

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.320 
that's like he looked at such a confused
device<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:41.250> they're<00:04:41.520> telling<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:42.000> story

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
device and as they're telling the story

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.400 
device and as they're telling the story
he's<00:04:42.810> slowly<00:04:43.220> moving<00:04:44.220> pieces<00:04:44.640> around<00:04:45.260> one<00:04:46.260> at

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
he's slowly moving pieces around one at

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.040 
he's slowly moving pieces around one at
a<00:04:46.470> time<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.420> making<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.510> seem<00:04:48.720> like<00:04:48.750> he

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
a time and making it seem like he

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990 
a time and making it seem like he
doesn't<00:04:49.350> know<00:04:49.440> what<00:04:49.560> he's<00:04:49.650> doing<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.250> then<00:04:50.820> by

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
doesn't know what he's doing and then by

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.940 
doesn't know what he's doing and then by
the<00:04:51.060> end<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.360> it<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.660> but<00:04:52.230> with<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.500> simple

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
the end of it and but with the simple

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.280 
the end of it and but with the simple
throw<00:04:53.190> up<00:04:53.340> into<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.700> air<00:04:53.940> he<00:04:54.660> managed<00:04:55.140> to

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
throw up into the air he managed to

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.670 
throw up into the air he managed to
solve<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.010> whole<00:04:56.220> cube<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.260> all<00:04:58.260> it<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.620> is

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
solve the whole cube and all it is is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.340 
solve the whole cube and all it is is
just<00:04:59.130> not<00:04:59.340> showing<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.390> bottom

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
just not showing the bottom

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.980 
just not showing the bottom
of<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:01.950> or<00:05:02.190> else<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.610> disillusions<00:05:03.480> everyone

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
of this or else it disillusions everyone

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.350 
of this or else it disillusions everyone
so<00:05:04.470> however<00:05:04.740> many<00:05:05.130> moves<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:06.120> feel

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
so however many moves you feel

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.680 
so however many moves you feel
comfortable<00:05:06.710> memorizing<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.920> then<00:05:08.820> having

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
comfortable memorizing and then having

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.470 
comfortable memorizing and then having
to<00:05:09.840> do<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.040> opposite<00:05:11.880> direction<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.920> for<00:05:13.920> me

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
to do the opposite direction so for me

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.120 
to do the opposite direction so for me
that's<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.690> algorithm<00:05:16.050> that's<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.770> pattern

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
that's the algorithm that's the pattern

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.220 
that's the algorithm that's the pattern
that<00:05:17.280> works<00:05:17.460> for<00:05:17.700> me<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.090> can<00:05:18.720> show<00:05:18.750> all<00:05:19.200> the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
that works for me I can show all the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.430 
that works for me I can show all the
sides<00:05:19.530> leave<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:19.980> down<00:05:20.100> on<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.340> table<00:05:21.440> let

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
sides leave it down on the table let

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.510 
sides leave it down on the table let
people<00:05:22.680> check<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.950> out<00:05:23.070> maybe<00:05:23.280> there's

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
people check it out maybe there's

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.460 
people check it out maybe there's
another<00:05:23.760> Rubik's<00:05:24.180> Cube<00:05:24.450> side<00:05:24.750> by<00:05:24.930> side<00:05:25.170> like<00:05:25.410> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
another Rubik's Cube side by side like a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.710 
another Rubik's Cube side by side like a
legitimate<00:05:26.010> one<00:05:26.160> oh<00:05:26.400> yeah<00:05:27.090> it<00:05:27.210> only<00:05:27.300> takes<00:05:27.570> 20

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
legitimate one oh yeah it only takes 20

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.450 
legitimate one oh yeah it only takes 20
moves<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.110> solve<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.470> so<00:05:28.650> let's<00:05:29.040> see<00:05:29.160> who<00:05:29.310> can

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
moves to solve it so let's see who can

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.760 
moves to solve it so let's see who can
solve<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:29.880> fastest<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.600> then<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.590> way

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
solve it the fastest and then that way

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.060 
solve it the fastest and then that way
you<00:05:32.070> can<00:05:32.760> simply<00:05:33.150> let<00:05:33.870> them<00:05:34.050> start<00:05:34.680> going

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
you can simply let them start going

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.580 
you can simply let them start going
maybe<00:05:35.490> they're<00:05:35.700> like<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:35.910> speedster<00:05:36.630> rubik's

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
maybe they're like a speedster rubik's

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.460 
maybe they're like a speedster rubik's
cube<00:05:37.950> God<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:39.810> just<00:05:40.020> go<00:05:40.140> 1<00:05:40.410> 2<00:05:40.950> 3<00:05:41.420> 4<00:05:42.470> only

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
cube God and you just go 1 2 3 4 only

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.340 
cube God and you just go 1 2 3 4 only
lighting<00:05:44.040> them<00:05:44.280> see<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:44.730> face<00:05:45.030> throw<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.050> up

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
lighting them see this face throw it up

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.200 
lighting them see this face throw it up
in<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.560> air<00:05:46.680> giving<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.220> that<00:05:47.400> blow<00:05:47.640> now<00:05:48.150> you

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
in the air giving it that blow now you

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.610 
in the air giving it that blow now you
could<00:05:48.600> throw<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:48.990> up<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.200> air<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.470> try<00:05:49.560> to

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
could throw it up in the air and try to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.530 
could throw it up in the air and try to
catch<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.250> risk<00:05:51.650> flashing<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.770> face<00:05:53.540> so

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
catch it and risk flashing the face so

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.500 
catch it and risk flashing the face so
the<00:05:55.410> change<00:05:55.710> again<00:05:56.220> is<00:05:56.370> up<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:56.640> you<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:57.060> could

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
the change again is up to you you could

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.050 
the change again is up to you you could
come<00:05:57.720> over<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.290> do<00:05:58.500> something<00:05:58.740> like<00:05:58.920> that<00:05:59.160> I

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
come over and do something like that I

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.780 
come over and do something like that I
come<00:06:01.020> down<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.530> do<00:06:01.710> one<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.370> those<00:06:02.490> types

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
come down and do one of those types

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.970 
come down and do one of those types
changes<00:06:03.530> it<00:06:04.530> is<00:06:05.400> totally<00:06:06.030> up<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.600> you<00:06:07.170> as<00:06:07.500> far

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
changes it is totally up to you as far

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.700 
changes it is totally up to you as far
as<00:06:08.130> how<00:06:08.310> you<00:06:08.340> want<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.910> actual<00:06:09.270> reveal<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.530> be

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
as how you want the actual reveal to be

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.330 
as how you want the actual reveal to be
I'm<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.730> fan<00:06:12.060> of<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.600> shakes<00:06:13.040> just<00:06:14.040> because

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
I'm a fan of the shakes just because

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.500 
I'm a fan of the shakes just because
it's<00:06:14.610> it's<00:06:15.480> harder<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:16.020> catch<00:06:16.260> a<00:06:16.380> shake<00:06:17.390> type<00:06:18.390> a

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
it's it's harder to catch a shake type a

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.740 
it's it's harder to catch a shake type a
deal<00:06:19.190> versus<00:06:20.190> like<00:06:20.460> maybe<00:06:21.210> they<00:06:21.420> see<00:06:21.480> these

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
deal versus like maybe they see these

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.960 
deal versus like maybe they see these
fingers<00:06:22.140> rotating<00:06:22.650> with<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.800> quick<00:06:23.280> turn<00:06:23.940> of

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
fingers rotating with a quick turn of

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.770 
fingers rotating with a quick turn of
the<00:06:24.180> hand<00:06:24.390> but<00:06:25.170> that's<00:06:25.890> totally<00:06:26.390> up<00:06:27.390> to<00:06:27.450> you

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
the hand but that's totally up to you

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.660 
the hand but that's totally up to you

find some kind of application for that I

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.780 
find some kind of application for that I
get<00:06:31.560> emails<00:06:31.980> and<00:06:32.100> questions<00:06:32.340> all<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.760> time

get emails and questions all the time

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.510 
get emails and questions all the time
about<00:06:33.240> you<00:06:33.750> know<00:06:34.110> stage<00:06:34.560> shows<00:06:34.890> and<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.280> think

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
about you know stage shows and I think

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.210 
about you know stage shows and I think
that<00:06:35.700> is<00:06:35.880> a<00:06:36.060> great<00:06:36.510> use<00:06:37.140> for<00:06:37.440> that<00:06:37.710> talent

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
that is a great use for that talent
