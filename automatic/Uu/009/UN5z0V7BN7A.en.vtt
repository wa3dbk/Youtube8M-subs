medical book there was love so we go
from<00:02:32.070> here<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.330> color<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:34.470> used<00:02:34.710> on<00:02:34.890> a

to<00:02:42.480> illustrate<00:02:44.810> we're<00:02:45.810> gonna<00:02:45.930> cheat<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
to illustrate we're gonna cheat here a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.780 
to illustrate we're gonna cheat here a
skeleton<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.140> human<00:02:49.410> body<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.890> look
