going to be time lapse quite a bit

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.129 
going to be time lapse quite a bit
because<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.950> several<00:00:11.280> hours<00:00:11.550> long<00:00:12.139> so

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
because well it's several hours long so

because well it's several hours long so
the<00:00:13.259> first<00:00:13.469> part<00:00:13.620> assembling<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.219> puzzle

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the first part assembling this puzzle

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129 
the first part assembling this puzzle
I'm<00:00:14.700> sorting<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> pieces<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.020> know

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
I'm sorting the pieces so that I know

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.900 
I'm sorting the pieces so that I know
which<00:00:16.410> ones<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.340> ones<00:00:17.580> may<00:00:17.850> be

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
which ones I have which ones may be

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
which ones I have which ones may be
missing<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.900> part<00:00:19.230> i'm<00:00:19.320> doing<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> megamix

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
missing this part i'm doing the megamix

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.570 
missing this part i'm doing the megamix
layer<00:00:21.710> moving<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.830> i'm<00:00:22.949> now<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
layer moving on i'm now going to the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
layer moving on i'm now going to the
Royal<00:00:23.730> pent<00:00:24.090> altima<00:00:24.510> layer<00:00:24.920> sorting<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
Royal pent altima layer sorting the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
Royal pent altima layer sorting the
parts<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:26.640> important<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
parts is really important because this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.890 
parts is really important because this
puzzle<00:00:28.439> has<00:00:28.820> 685<00:00:29.820> parts<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.660> there<00:00:30.840> are

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
puzzle has 685 parts and if there are

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
puzzle has 685 parts and if there are
any<00:00:31.019> missing<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.340> important

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
any missing that it's really important

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.319 
any missing that it's really important
to<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.590> sorting<00:00:35.180> helps<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
to know so the sorting helps with that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
to know so the sorting helps with that
and<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.809> later<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.040> assembling

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and also later on when I'm assembling

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
and also later on when I'm assembling
the<00:00:38.610> puzzle<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.090> easier<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> locate

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the puzzle will be easier to locate

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260 
the puzzle will be easier to locate
cases<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> soaring<00:00:41.190> helps<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> aspect<00:00:41.969> as

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
cases so soaring helps in that aspect as

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.819 
cases so soaring helps in that aspect as
well<00:00:46.370> miraculously<00:00:47.370> none<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> parts

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
well miraculously none of the parts

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.439 
well miraculously none of the parts
we're<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.010> missing<00:00:50.640> from<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
we're actually missing from the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.459 
we're actually missing from the
shapeways<00:00:52.199> order<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> placed<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.469> 685

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
shapeways order that I placed so 685

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.869 
shapeways order that I placed so 685
parts<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> done<00:00:56.100> missing<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.550> pretty

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
parts and done missing that's pretty

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.130 
parts and done missing that's pretty
impressive<00:00:57.360> especially<00:00:57.930> during<00:00:58.440> the<00:01:00.140> period

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
impressive especially during the period

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
impressive especially during the period
of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> price<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.309> Shapeways<00:01:02.670> was

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of the price change that Shapeways was

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
of the price change that Shapeways was
going<00:01:03.120> through<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.460> how<00:01:05.580> they

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of the triangle counts I was able to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
of the triangle counts I was able to
reduce<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> 8<00:02:00.420> sets<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.590> isn't<00:02:01.890> great

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
reduce that to 8 sets which isn't great

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.500 
reduce that to 8 sets which isn't great
but<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.460> than<00:02:02.580> nothing<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.330> did

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
but it's better than nothing and it did

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.680 
but it's better than nothing and it did
save<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.470> money<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.000> also<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
save some money and also some of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.070 
save some money and also some of
shapeways<00:02:07.650> labor<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.160> well<00:02:08.369> which<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.600> really

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
shapeways labor as well which was really

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.010 
shapeways labor as well which was really
helpful

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.830 

and<00:02:14.590> all<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> spares<00:02:15.100> were<00:02:15.280> also<00:02:15.720> present<00:02:16.720> as

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and all the spares were also present as

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.820 
and all the spares were also present as
well

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.340 

now<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.670> part<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.150> I'm<00:02:22.630> sanding

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
now in this part right here I'm sanding

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.230 
now in this part right here I'm sanding
the<00:02:23.470> pieces<00:02:23.830> down<00:02:23.980> using<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.460> dremel<00:02:24.670> wheel<00:02:25.000> and

all the screws and the 12 centerpieces

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.220 
all the screws and the 12 centerpieces
this<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.860> core<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.630> puzzle<00:02:43.930> which<00:02:44.080> is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
this is the core of the puzzle which is

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.020 
this is the core of the puzzle which is
a<00:02:44.380> mega<00:02:44.620> mix<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.890> puzzle<00:02:48.250> has<00:02:48.400> four<00:02:48.670> total

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
a mega mix this puzzle has four total

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.480 
a mega mix this puzzle has four total
shells<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.570> builds<00:02:50.170> from<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.410> mega<00:02:50.650> mix<00:02:50.890> to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
shells it builds from a mega mix to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.880 
shells it builds from a mega mix to
appear<00:02:51.760> mix<00:02:51.910> crystal<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.960> royal<00:02:53.230> pent<00:02:53.500> altima

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
appear mix crystal to royal pent altima

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.920 
appear mix crystal to royal pent altima
and<00:02:54.070> then<00:02:54.160> finally<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.030> master<00:02:55.480> brillant

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
and then finally to the master brillant

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.910 
and then finally to the master brillant
so<00:02:56.740> four<00:02:57.250> shells<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:58.020> 685<00:02:59.020> parts<00:02:59.380> it's<00:02:59.709> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
so four shells and 685 parts it's a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.699 
so four shells and 685 parts it's a
crazy<00:03:00.130> puzzle<00:03:00.990> right<00:03:01.990> here<00:03:02.230> I'm<00:03:02.350> putting<00:03:02.620> you

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
crazy puzzle right here I'm putting you

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:11.170 
crazy puzzle right here I'm putting you
in<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.860> pieces<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> actual<00:03:04.390> megamix

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.759 

it's<00:03:11.689> pretty<00:03:11.930> difficult<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.379> get<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> last

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
it's pretty difficult to get the last

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.599 
it's pretty difficult to get the last
piece<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:14.530> attention<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> puzzle<00:03:15.950> evenly<00:03:16.340> and

piece in attention the puzzle evenly and
working<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.569> just<00:03:17.599> a<00:03:17.930> little<00:03:18.079> bit<00:03:20.019> now

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
working in in just a little bit now

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.869 
working in in just a little bit now
moving<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.500> with<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.829> pyramids<00:03:22.250> crystal<00:03:22.730> edge

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
moving on with the pyramids crystal edge

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.420 
moving on with the pyramids crystal edge
pieces<00:03:23.180> which<00:03:23.989> simply<00:03:24.409> get<00:03:24.590> inserted<00:03:24.920> one

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
pieces which simply get inserted one

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.289 
pieces which simply get inserted one
layer<00:03:25.700> above<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.299> megamix<00:03:27.849> this<00:03:28.849> is<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
layer above the megamix this is just the

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.360 
layer above the megamix this is just the
standard<00:03:29.689> pyramids<00:03:30.409> crystal<00:03:30.799> mechanism<00:03:31.280> that

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
standard pyramids crystal mechanism that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.890 
standard pyramids crystal mechanism that
you<00:03:31.489> see<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.939> mass-produced<00:03:32.389> puzzle<00:03:32.780> as

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
you see in the mass-produced puzzle as

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
you see in the mass-produced puzzle as
well<00:03:33.109> although<00:03:33.650> because<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:34.670> his<00:03:34.760> spherical

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
well although because of his spherical

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:45.580 
well although because of his spherical
grooves<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.719> works<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.439> little<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.739> better

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.320 

so<00:03:46.190> now<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.519> pyramids<00:03:46.879> crystal<00:03:47.239> is

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
so now that the pyramids crystal is

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.119 
so now that the pyramids crystal is
assembled<00:03:47.780> it's<00:03:47.959> time<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.349> start<00:03:48.620> with<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
assembled it's time to start with the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.250 
assembled it's time to start with the
Royal<00:03:49.370> pen<00:03:49.610> Saltzman<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.690> was<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:50.959> longest

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
Royal pen Saltzman this was the longest

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.190 
Royal pen Saltzman this was the longest
step<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.010> entire<00:03:52.370> assembly<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.300> took

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
step of the entire assembly and took

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.590 
step of the entire assembly and took
several<00:03:54.500> hours

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.360 

now<00:04:01.170> you'll<00:04:01.320> notice<00:04:01.440> some<00:04:01.590> parts<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.190> this

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
now you'll notice some parts in this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.640 
now you'll notice some parts in this
part<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> assembly<00:04:03.750> i'll<00:04:03.990> be<00:04:04.170> using<00:04:04.350> some

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
part of the assembly i'll be using some

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.710 
part of the assembly i'll be using some
masking<00:04:05.100> tape<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.460> this<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.390> make<00:04:06.570> it

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
masking tape and this is to make it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.900 
masking tape and this is to make it
easier<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:07.290> me<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.440> assemble<00:04:08.070> whole<00:04:08.520> groups

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
easier for me to assemble whole groups

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.630 
easier for me to assemble whole groups
of<00:04:09.060> parts<00:04:09.390> without<00:04:09.960> those<00:04:10.350> groups<00:04:10.710> falling

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
of parts without those groups falling

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.550 
of parts without those groups falling
apart<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.180> hands<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:13.230> makes<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
apart in my hands and it makes it a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.010 
apart in my hands and it makes it a
little<00:04:13.650> bit<00:04:13.830> easier<00:04:14.660> some<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.840> sections

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
little bit easier some of the sections

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.199 
little bit easier some of the sections
of<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.350> assembly<00:04:16.620> are<00:04:16.920> jump<00:04:17.280> cut<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:17.760> that's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
of the assembly are jump cut and that's

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.690 
of the assembly are jump cut and that's
because<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.600> didn't<00:04:19.050> have<00:04:19.200> enough<00:04:19.489> room<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
because I didn't have enough room to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.390 
because I didn't have enough room to
record<00:04:21.060> everything<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.900> my<00:04:22.050> camera<00:04:22.350> but<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.160> did

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
record everything in my camera but I did

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.770 
record everything in my camera but I did
get<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.580> lot<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.060> important<00:04:25.050> stages<00:04:26.780> you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
get a lot of the important stages you

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.720 
get a lot of the important stages you
can<00:04:27.930> see<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.440> this<00:04:28.620> section<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.340> video

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
can see in this section of the video

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.000 
can see in this section of the video
that<00:04:30.030> pretty<00:04:30.930> much<00:04:31.110> half<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.590> puzzle<00:04:31.920> is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
that pretty much half the puzzle is

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.239 
that pretty much half the puzzle is
assembled<00:04:32.460> at<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.670> point

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.579 

this<00:04:40.849> is<00:04:41.029> a<00:04:41.059> very<00:04:41.179> slow<00:04:41.539> process<00:04:41.839> and<00:04:42.199> it<00:04:42.409> just

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:42.589 
this is a very slow process and it just

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.709 
this is a very slow process and it just
involved<00:04:43.009> inserting<00:04:43.429> assembling<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.539> piece

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
involved inserting assembling it piece

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.439 
involved inserting assembling it piece
by<00:04:44.749> piece<00:04:44.959> and<00:04:45.529> in<00:04:46.399> some<00:04:46.579> cases<00:04:46.819> I<00:04:47.029> had<00:04:47.179> to<00:04:47.299> use

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
by piece and in some cases I had to use

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.829 
by piece and in some cases I had to use
some<00:04:47.479> tweezers<00:04:47.959> to<00:04:48.789> carefully<00:04:49.789> put<00:04:50.299> pieces<00:04:50.539> in

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:50.839 
some tweezers to carefully put pieces in

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:57.159 
some tweezers to carefully put pieces in
the<00:04:51.289> precarious<00:04:52.009> areas<00:04:55.899> when<00:04:56.899> the<00:04:56.989> Royal

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
the precarious areas when the Royal

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.779 
the precarious areas when the Royal
pentyl<00:04:57.589> tamat<00:04:57.829> layer<00:04:58.009> is<00:04:58.159> assembled<00:04:58.669> this

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
pentyl tamat layer is assembled this

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.249 
pentyl tamat layer is assembled this
will<00:04:58.999> form<00:04:59.239> the<00:04:59.299> pier<00:04:59.569> makes<00:04:59.719> crystal<00:05:00.109> edge

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
will form the pier makes crystal edge

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.099 
will form the pier makes crystal edge
groups<00:05:00.649> on<00:05:00.829> the<00:05:00.979> outer<00:05:01.129> puzzle<00:05:01.609> and<00:05:02.049> these<00:05:03.049> are

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:03.109 
groups on the outer puzzle and these are

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:04.689 
groups on the outer puzzle and these are
the<00:05:03.319> groups<00:05:03.469> that<00:05:03.649> then<00:05:03.919> hold<00:05:04.189> on<00:05:04.309> to<00:05:04.579> the

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
the groups that then hold on to the

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.209 
the groups that then hold on to the
corner<00:05:05.059> groups<00:05:05.299> and<00:05:05.649> that's<00:05:06.649> how<00:05:06.799> the<00:05:06.859> puzzle

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
corner groups and that's how the puzzle

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:21.910 
corner groups and that's how the puzzle
works

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.070 

this<00:05:22.580> point<00:05:22.850> we're<00:05:23.090> coming<00:05:23.390> pretty<00:05:23.570> close<00:05:23.780> to

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
this point we're coming pretty close to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.290 
this point we're coming pretty close to
the<00:05:24.170> end<00:05:24.320> of<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.890> assembly<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.880> shell

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:43.890 

now<00:05:29.300> it's<00:05:29.510> just<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.810> top<00:05:30.020> pieces<00:05:30.290> left<00:05:30.620> over

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.379 

and<00:05:44.020> some<00:05:44.800> more<00:05:44.949> masking<00:05:45.400> tape<00:05:45.639> to<00:05:45.970> put<00:05:46.210> these

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
and some more masking tape to put these

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.980 
and some more masking tape to put these
final<00:05:46.810> pieces<00:05:47.050> in

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.950 

and<00:05:52.140> now<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.800> puzzle<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.490> assembled<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.180> I

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
and now the puzzle is assembled and I

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.260 
and now the puzzle is assembled and I
did<00:05:55.200> work<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.620> in<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.800> little<00:05:56.040> bit<00:05:56.190> as<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:57.120> can

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
did work it in a little bit as you can

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.790 
did work it in a little bit as you can
see<00:05:57.480> right<00:05:57.510> here<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:59.480> puzzle<00:06:00.480> is<00:06:00.630> turning<00:06:01.170> its

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
see right here and puzzle is turning its

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.230 
see right here and puzzle is turning its
only<00:06:02.040> the<00:06:02.130> deep<00:06:02.370> layers<00:06:02.580> at<00:06:02.850> this<00:06:02.970> point

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
only the deep layers at this point

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.320 
only the deep layers at this point
though<00:06:03.450> but<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.140> at<00:06:04.860> this<00:06:05.460> point<00:06:05.760> in<00:06:05.880> time<00:06:05.910> I

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
though but I at this point in time I

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.570 
though but I at this point in time I
went<00:06:07.290> away<00:06:07.410> and<00:06:07.650> I<00:06:07.740> broke<00:06:07.920> it<00:06:07.980> in<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.250> little<00:06:08.460> bit

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
went away and I broke it in a little bit

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.410 
went away and I broke it in a little bit
more<00:06:08.760> before<00:06:08.850> continuing<00:06:09.300> on<00:06:09.660> and<00:06:11.420> now

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
more before continuing on and now

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.390 
more before continuing on and now
finally<00:06:12.690> here's<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.200> last<00:06:13.440> layer<00:06:13.740> or<00:06:14.220> I'm

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
finally here's the last layer or I'm

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400 
finally here's the last layer or I'm
assembling<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:15.270> master<00:06:15.810> brilliant<00:06:16.290> layer

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
assembling the master brilliant layer

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.080 
assembling the master brilliant layer
the<00:06:16.590> outer<00:06:16.740> Pyrenees<00:06:17.130> crystal<00:06:17.520> pieces<00:06:17.670> and

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
the outer Pyrenees crystal pieces and

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.960 
the outer Pyrenees crystal pieces and
you<00:06:18.810> can<00:06:18.960> see<00:06:19.140> these<00:06:19.320> pieces<00:06:19.710> going<00:06:20.700> into<00:06:20.880> the

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
you can see these pieces going into the

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.450 
you can see these pieces going into the
corner<00:06:21.420> gaps<00:06:21.720> on<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.290> outer<00:06:22.470> dodecahedral

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
corner gaps on the outer dodecahedral

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.440 
corner gaps on the outer dodecahedral
shade<00:06:25.520> this<00:06:26.520> didn't<00:06:26.850> take<00:06:26.970> too<00:06:27.150> long<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:29.450> this

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
shade this didn't take too long and this

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.790 
shade this didn't take too long and this
is<00:06:30.570> pretty<00:06:30.870> simple<00:06:31.400> straightforward<00:06:32.400> and

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
is pretty simple straightforward and

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.140 
is pretty simple straightforward and
right<00:06:34.800> here<00:06:35.040> the<00:06:35.190> puzzle<00:06:35.520> is<00:06:35.670> finally

that you saw in the video and it's

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.180 
that you saw in the video and it's
turning<00:06:43.890> I<00:06:45.020> did<00:06:46.020> go<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.740> break<00:06:46.860> it<00:06:47.040> in<00:06:47.130> a

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
turning I did go and break it in a

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.950 
turning I did go and break it in a
little<00:06:47.310> bit<00:06:47.520> more<00:06:47.700> before<00:06:47.820> continuing<00:06:48.270> on<00:06:48.660> and

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
little bit more before continuing on and

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.500 
little bit more before continuing on and
after<00:06:49.950> I<00:06:50.220> semble<00:06:50.610> the<00:06:50.670> puzzle<00:06:51.030> I<00:06:51.180> went<00:06:51.420> ahead

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
after I semble the puzzle I went ahead

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.690 
after I semble the puzzle I went ahead
and<00:06:51.690> dyed<00:06:51.840> it<00:06:51.960> black<00:06:52.370> assembled<00:06:53.370> it<00:06:53.430> one<00:06:53.550> more

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
and dyed it black assembled it one more

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.000 
and dyed it black assembled it one more
time<00:06:53.910> and<00:06:54.240> then<00:06:54.350> stickered<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.470> puzzle<00:06:55.800> with

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
time and then stickered the puzzle with

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.700 
time and then stickered the puzzle with
all<00:06:56.760> of<00:06:56.910> your<00:06:57.060> stickers<00:06:57.420> and<00:06:57.630> then<00:06:58.500> it<00:06:58.590> was

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
all of your stickers and then it was

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.250 
all of your stickers and then it was
finished<00:06:59.600> so<00:07:00.600> that's<00:07:00.720> about<00:07:00.870> it<00:07:00.960> for<00:07:01.080> this

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
finished so that's about it for this
