 [Music] 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 because 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.539
 [Music] 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.539
 [Applause] 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.660

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.920
 sport still based on running the lamp ' 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.200
 so coffee 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 this new is correct new generation 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.590
 very much like big sister 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.050
 today we drive the range rover in the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.750
 sdv6 autobiography dynamic further 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 had to perform and that's what we will do 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.710
 showed him today 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.030
 well what is now in the diesel that is 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.500
 available from 114,900 euros 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.390
 we have it you know you are completely full 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.200
 with options that goes and head towards the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.909
 under 28 is the range rover sport 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 available in the most basic version 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.250
 that tdv6 s from 83,500 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.020
 [Music] 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.310
 is completely for top model the go you go 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.680
 of course from superchart 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.590
 that's the 5 point 0 than the v8 we have 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.960
 Also know Jaguar is not so whole 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.300
 very economical but very fast 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.100
 this now consumes 7 half a liter 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.320
 Elm trees so if you go too 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.820
 a bit normal row are row 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.659
 nice trip also definitely this one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.310
 we recommend a kick is really huge 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.899
 world of difference 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.850
 just like a big sister to the last 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.009
 reason this car must also be much lighter 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.200
 and there is your contact with the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.610
 way to much better helps less about 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.800
 light of fact 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.800
 This is just a perfect driving SUV 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:28.150
 [Music] 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.580
 just like with the big mind 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.560
 lay that 2x also say we are one 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.680
 honest hi sorry 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.660
 ventilated leather seats 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.470
 the dashboard is therefore a two color 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.120
 ivory and black others at the top 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.310
 the navigation system has been going on for a while 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.660
 doing but land grabbing races is not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.040
 more greatest friend 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.510
 I don't think it's a very familiar voice 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.510
 to cooperate but so be it 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.980
 but we already know from luxury models 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.630
 Jack 's Land Rover was that machine 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.450
 that nicer you ever what a very soft 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.370
 comes up and also pays me a little too long 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.440
 if you really want to exercise fast, you have to 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.000
 wait a moment until he is up 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.480
 sportier models including this one 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:20.949
 all have a package 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:20.949
 [Music] 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.770
 [Applause] 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.760
 diesel and the sdv6 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.000
 I feel that it drives a little 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.599
 More powerful good as the TDV8 of it 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.250
 previous sport model it is what 219 hp 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.049
 and standards 100 and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.959
 really seveke must be wise could really fast 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.150
 a big car 600 meters far 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.489
 you really don't need anything anymore 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.640

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.859

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.780

 he black elements are everywhere 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.799
 set back already has docking mirrors 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.970
 He therefore also air vents you 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.049
 they actually have no function alone 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.359
 but for the ornamental 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.470

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.730
 evoque 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.650

 prepare a maximum of 85 centimeters 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.300

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.759
