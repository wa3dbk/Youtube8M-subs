00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.010 
paint then I took this really fun paper
I<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.790> paper<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.240> Michaels<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I got all this paper at Michaels and I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
I got all this paper at Michaels and I
literally<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.619> cut<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.369> rectangle<00:01:35.939> off

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
literally just cut like a rectangle off

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
literally just cut like a rectangle off
so<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> could<00:01:37.049> make<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> spine<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
so that I could make the spine of the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.890 
so that I could make the spine of the
notebook<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.150> cooler<00:01:39.600> than

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
notebook look a little bit cooler than

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
notebook look a little bit cooler than
just<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> average<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.060> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just the average you know so then I just

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
just the average you know so then I just
glued<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.320> crazy<00:01:43.649> glue<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
glued it down with some crazy glue to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
glued it down with some crazy glue to
make<00:01:44.850> sure<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> sticks

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.600 

for<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.170> second<00:01:50.530> notebook<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.040> took<00:01:51.220> this<00:01:51.340> cool

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
for the second notebook I took this cool

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.940 
for the second notebook I took this cool
cork<00:01:52.060> paper<00:01:52.330> again<00:01:52.869> founded<00:01:53.290> at<00:01:53.380> Michaels<00:01:53.740> and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
cork paper again founded at Michaels and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.190 
cork paper again founded at Michaels and
I<00:01:54.040> basically<00:01:54.400> just<00:01:54.490> cut<00:01:54.909> out<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.450> length<00:01:55.960> and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
I basically just cut out the length and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.410 
I basically just cut out the length and
width<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.920> notebook<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.490> then<00:01:57.940> proceeded

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
width of the notebook and then proceeded

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.690 
width of the notebook and then proceeded
to<00:01:58.450> glue<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.170> down<00:01:59.350> with<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.979> same<00:02:00.159> crazy<00:02:00.430> glue

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
to glue it down with the same crazy glue

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.670 
to glue it down with the same crazy glue
this<00:02:01.090> glue<00:02:01.299> like<00:02:01.540> insane<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.140> works<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.650> well

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
this glue like insane it works so well

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.460 
this glue like insane it works so well
so<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.520> suggest<00:02:04.479> putting<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.840> both<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.320> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
so I suggest putting it both on the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.040 
so I suggest putting it both on the
paper<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.310> notebook<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.750> then<00:02:07.990> I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
paper and on the notebook and then I

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.970 
paper and on the notebook and then I
just<00:02:08.289> stuck<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.679> down<00:02:08.860> like<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.800> after<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.950> I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
just stuck it down like so after that I

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.400 
just stuck it down like so after that I
took<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.430> cool<00:02:12.670> shimmery<00:02:13.330> black<00:02:13.660> paper<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
took this cool shimmery black paper and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.620 
took this cool shimmery black paper and
just<00:02:14.530> cut<00:02:14.739> out<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> random<00:02:15.520> shape<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.450> am

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
just cut out a random shape that I am

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.210 
just cut out a random shape that I am
then<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.110> glue<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> front<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
then going to glue on the front of the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.090 
then going to glue on the front of the
notebook<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.410> after<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> glue<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.860> down

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
notebook and after you glue that down

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.620 
notebook and after you glue that down
you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.459> pretty<00:02:21.730> much<00:02:21.820> write<00:02:22.090> whatever<00:02:22.300> you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
you can pretty much write whatever you

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.949 
you can pretty much write whatever you
want

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
want

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.870 
want
I<00:02:23.050> used<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.410> chalk<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.430> write<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
I used to chalk so that I can write a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.690 
I used to chalk so that I can write a
subject<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:25.900> erase<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.920> right<00:02:27.070> after<00:02:27.430> if

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
subject and then erase it right after if

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.890 
subject and then erase it right after if
you<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.239> want<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> use<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.720> notebook

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you know you want to use the notebook

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.949 
you know you want to use the notebook
for<00:02:29.050> something<00:02:29.500> else<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.330> next<00:02:34.569> one<00:02:34.720> I

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
for something else for the next one I

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.990 
for something else for the next one I
also<00:02:35.260> cut<00:02:35.650> out<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.800> piece<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.370> cool<00:02:36.610> patterned

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
paper the same size as the notebook and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.770 
paper the same size as the notebook and
then<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.130> glued<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.580> right<00:02:42.819> down<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.630> can

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
then I just glued it right down you can

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.090 
then I just glued it right down you can
use<00:02:43.810> our<00:02:44.019> leave<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.350> black<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.739> white<00:02:44.800> like

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
down this one I decided to make an idea

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.120 
down this one I decided to make an idea
notebook<00:03:14.240> because<00:03:14.690> who<00:03:15.440> doesn't<00:03:15.740> have<00:03:15.830> tons

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
notebook because who doesn't have tons

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.470 
notebook because who doesn't have tons
of<00:03:16.280> ideas<00:03:16.370> they<00:03:16.760> always<00:03:17.000> just<00:03:17.150> want<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.360> write

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
of ideas they always just want to write

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.460 
of ideas they always just want to write
down<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.870> random<00:03:18.170> notebook<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:21.140> those<00:03:21.380> are

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
down in a random notebook so those are

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.960
