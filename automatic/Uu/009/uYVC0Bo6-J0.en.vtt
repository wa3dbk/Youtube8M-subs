00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.870 

now<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.000> course<00:03:02.240> I'm<00:03:02.420> not<00:03:02.540> going<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.020> be<00:03:03.880> you

know<00:03:04.970> leaving<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:05.690> heavy<00:03:05.960> dangling<00:03:06.620> thing

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
know leaving that heavy dangling thing

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.280 
know leaving that heavy dangling thing
on<00:03:07.250> there<00:03:07.490> during<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.120> healing<00:03:08.330> process<00:03:08.720> or

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
on there during the healing process or

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.260 
on there during the healing process or
anything<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:09.830> it'd<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:10.280> be<00:03:10.490> madness

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
anything like that it'd just be madness
