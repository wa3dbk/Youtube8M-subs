tutorial so what it is it's a geothermal

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.540 
tutorial so what it is it's a geothermal
or<00:00:19.380> level<00:00:20.300> EU<00:00:21.300> generator<00:00:22.009> so<00:00:23.009> what<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> need

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
or level EU generator so what you need

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
or level EU generator so what you need
is<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> geothermal<00:00:24.630> generator<00:00:24.929> is<00:00:25.499> just<00:00:25.679> made

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
is a geothermal generator is just made

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.809 
is a geothermal generator is just made
like<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.449> real<00:00:27.449> simple<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:29.369> need<00:00:29.489> a<00:00:29.519> pump

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:29.819 
like this real simple you need a pump

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.540 
like this real simple you need a pump
which<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.749> just<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> mining<00:00:31.349> oil<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.890> tank<00:00:32.250> what

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
which is just a mining oil and tank what

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.569 
which is just a mining oil and tank what
you<00:00:32.669> make<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:34.070> some<00:00:35.070> electric<00:00:35.399> ones

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
you make like that some electric ones

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.509 
you make like that some electric ones
and<00:00:36.079> AB<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.350> box<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.010> our

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
and AB a box or some other our

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.509 
and AB a box or some other our
collection<00:00:39.090> device<00:00:39.359> something<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.519> so

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
collection device something like that so

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.209 
collection device something like that so
what<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.510> mining

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
what you want to do when you're mining

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.270 
what you want to do when you're mining
is<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> find<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> nice<00:00:45.089> lava<00:00:45.839> pool<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.379> don't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
is if you find a nice lava pool I don't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
is if you find a nice lava pool I don't
don't<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.699> pass<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> by<00:00:48.179> a<00:00:48.530> stop<00:00:49.530> where<00:00:49.769> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
don't just pass it by a stop where you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.630 
don't just pass it by a stop where you
are<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.989> bring<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.170> tools<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.370> set<00:00:53.550> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
are and bring out your tools you set up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
are and bring out your tools you set up
your<00:00:53.670> pump<00:00:54.030> over<00:00:54.359> top<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.809> sure<00:00:55.019> that<00:00:55.260> there

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
your pump over top make sure that there

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.880 
your pump over top make sure that there
is<00:00:55.679> a<00:00:56.899> passage<00:00:57.899> underneath<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> get

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is a passage underneath for it to get

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
is a passage underneath for it to get
right<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.249> lava<00:00:59.480> um<00:01:00.480> put<00:01:01.019> it<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
right to the lava um put it right there

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
right to the lava um put it right there
set<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.249> geothermal<00:01:02.670> generator<00:01:02.999> right

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
set up the geothermal generator right

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
set up the geothermal generator right
next<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.199> sure<00:01:04.350> they're<00:01:04.470> touching

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
next to it make sure they're touching

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
next to it make sure they're touching
like<00:01:04.980> that<00:01:05.570> what<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.660> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
like that what you want to do then is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
like that what you want to do then is
set<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.860> electrical<00:01:08.580> engine<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> side

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
set up an electrical engine on that side

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.110 
set up an electrical engine on that side
you<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.980> just<00:01:11.190> use<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.610> I'll<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:11.970> use

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
you you can just use one I'll just use

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.330 
you you can just use one I'll just use
two<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.770> demonstration<00:01:13.770> purposes<00:01:14.130> today

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
two for demonstration purposes today

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730 
two for demonstration purposes today
hook<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:15.480> up<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.900> geothermal<00:01:16.350> generator

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
hook them up to the geothermal generator

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.460 
hook them up to the geothermal generator
like<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:20.660> levers<00:01:21.660> on<00:01:21.810> both<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.230> course

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
like this and levers on both of course

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
like this and levers on both of course
so<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.130> work<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:24.420> flick<00:01:24.630> those<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.960> for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so they work I just flick those on for

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.000 
so they work I just flick those on for
now<00:01:25.230> it's<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.710> work<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
now it's not going to work because

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.810 
now it's not going to work because
there's<00:01:26.280> no<00:01:26.690> power<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.080> yet<00:01:28.260> but<00:01:29.220> now

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
there's no power in here yet but now

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.540 
there's no power in here yet but now
we're<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.120> put<00:01:30.180> back<00:01:30.780> box<00:01:31.080> here<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
we're going to put back box here to

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.380 
we're going to put back box here to
click<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.880> energy

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
click the energy

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.330 
click the energy
and<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.680> all<00:01:35.860> we<00:01:35.979> need<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:37.920> bucket<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.159> lava

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
and now all we need is a bucket of lava

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.830 
and now all we need is a bucket of lava
to<00:01:39.729> get<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.150> started<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.670> there<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.210> go<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
to get this started so there we go the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.649 
to get this started so there we go the
engines<00:01:44.170> are<00:01:44.260> going<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:46.240> should<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.510> the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
engines are going that should get the

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.690 
engines are going that should get the
pump<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:48.250> see<00:01:48.400> this<00:01:48.550> is

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
pump going and you can see this is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.070 
pump going and you can see this is
filling<00:01:49.030> up<00:01:49.119> with<00:01:49.240> more<00:01:49.479> love<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.690> not<00:01:49.930> from

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
filling up with more love and not from

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.650 
filling up with more love and not from
the<00:01:50.200> bucket<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.610> getting<00:01:51.940> from<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.270> pump<00:01:52.479> I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
the bucket it's getting from the pump I

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.340 
the bucket it's getting from the pump I
can<00:01:52.840> show<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.080> down<00:01:53.440> here<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.229> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
can show you down here that this is the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.660 
can show you down here that this is the
pump<00:01:56.560> that's<00:01:56.860> coming<00:01:57.100> from<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> pump<00:01:57.520> it's

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
pump that's coming from the pump it's

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.359 
pump that's coming from the pump it's
sucking<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.000> ball<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.270> lava<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:59.040> this<00:02:00.040> filling

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
sucking a ball to lava and this filling

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.960 
sucking a ball to lava and this filling
up<00:02:00.490> with<00:02:00.610> EU<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:03.220> will<00:02:03.729> probably

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
up with EU so this this will probably

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.450 
up with EU so this this will probably
take<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.479> less<00:02:05.380> than<00:02:05.440> an<00:02:05.710> hour's<00:02:06.070> worth<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
take you less than an hour's worth of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.130 
take you less than an hour's worth of
mining<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.149> get<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.420> resources<00:02:07.720> for

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
mining just to get the resources for

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.410 
mining just to get the resources for
this<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.440> really<00:02:08.739> simple<00:02:08.979> just<00:02:09.789> some<00:02:09.940> tin<00:02:10.209> is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
this it's really simple just some tin is

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.550 
this it's really simple just some tin is
probably<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> hardest<00:02:10.869> part<00:02:11.260> you're<00:02:11.440> gonna

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
probably the hardest part you're gonna

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.490 
probably the hardest part you're gonna
have<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> get<00:02:12.180> some<00:02:13.180> refined<00:02:13.570> iron<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.260> some

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
have to get some refined iron and some

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.860 
have to get some refined iron and some
batteries<00:02:14.980> that's<00:02:15.220> about<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:18.780> once<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
batteries that's about it so once you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.090 
batteries that's about it so once you
get<00:02:19.989> more<00:02:20.170> advanced<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.830> into<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
get more advanced you can go into the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.740 
get more advanced you can go into the
nether<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> works<00:02:21.880> great<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.239> another<00:02:22.450> two

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
nether the works great in another two

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.630 
nether the works great in another two
I'm<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.739> see<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.950> sucking<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.370> lava

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
I'm you can see it sucking up the lava

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.900 
I'm you can see it sucking up the lava
down<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:26.769> produce<00:02:27.310> runs<00:02:27.580> 11

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
down there but it's will produce runs 11

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.620 
down there but it's will produce runs 11
that's<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.090> great<00:02:28.480> way<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> start<00:02:29.110> off<00:02:29.230> your

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
to show you how i set up my system using

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.490 
to show you how i set up my system using
the<00:02:45.850> last<00:02:46.299> one<00:02:46.510> only<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> slightly<00:02:47.290> more

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
the last one only a slightly more

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.860 
the last one only a slightly more
advanced<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:48.910> got<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.150> system<00:02:49.480> i<00:02:49.630> just

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
advanced so we got the system i just

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.710 
advanced so we got the system i just
showed<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:51.160> got<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> pump<00:02:51.670> there<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.209> we're

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
showed you we got the pump there I we're

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.430 
showed you we got the pump there I we're
in<00:02:52.810> another<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.150> here<00:02:55.420> giant<00:02:56.260> pool

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
in another so just out here giant pool

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.740 
in another so just out here giant pool
of<00:02:56.470> lava<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.459> it's<00:03:00.610> pumped<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.090> goes<00:03:01.540> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of lava and so it's pumped in goes to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.759 
of lava and so it's pumped in goes to
the<00:03:01.870> geothermal<00:03:02.290> generator<00:03:03.269> these<00:03:04.269> are

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the geothermal generator these are

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.759 
the geothermal generator these are
liquid<00:03:05.769> x<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.750> guys<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.140> look<00:03:08.230> these<00:03:08.410> all<00:03:08.620> up

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
liquid x you guys can look these all up

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:09.720 
liquid x you guys can look these all up
i'm<00:03:08.890> not<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> show<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.430> how<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> make

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
i'm not going to show you how to make

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.100 
i'm not going to show you how to make
them

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
them

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.020 
them
come<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.470> my<00:03:10.500> thirst<00:03:10.830> tons<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.160> accused<00:03:11.460> as

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
come up to my thirst tons of accused as

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.830 
come up to my thirst tons of accused as
is<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> chunk<00:03:12.720> loader<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> liquid

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
is a chunk loader and this is a liquid

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.300 
is a chunk loader and this is a liquid
tesseract<00:03:15.840> which<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.470> very<00:03:16.680> important<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
tesseract which is very important you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.390 
tesseract which is very important you
need<00:03:17.610> two<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.850> them<00:03:18.890> just<00:03:19.890> sucked<00:03:20.100> into<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
need two of them just sucked into the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.470 
need two of them just sucked into the
same<00:03:20.550> frequency<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:24.060> what<00:03:24.210> I<00:03:24.240> have

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
same frequency so that's what I have

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.240 
same frequency so that's what I have
these<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.990> pump<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.320> into<00:03:25.500> there<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:25.740> into

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
these just pump it into there and into

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.630 
these just pump it into there and into
their<00:03:26.400> i'm<00:03:27.240> so<00:03:27.650> i'm<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.830> show<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.010> what

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
their i'm so i'm going to show you what

their i'm so i'm going to show you what
I<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.910> at<00:03:30.150> my<00:03:30.180> base<00:03:33.860> alright<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.570> my<00:03:36.570> base<00:03:36.780> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
I have at my base alright so my base is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.520 
I have at my base alright so my base is
quite<00:03:37.260> new<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.580> I'm<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.850> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> show<00:03:39.120> you

quite new so I'm just going to show you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.140 
quite new so I'm just going to show you
just<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.709> simple<00:03:40.980> setup<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.490> how<00:03:41.610> quick<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
just a simple setup and how quick and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.470 
just a simple setup and how quick and
easy<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:44.730> like<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> last<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.300> in

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
easy it is it's like the last one in

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.610 
easy it is it's like the last one in
slightly<00:03:45.660> more<00:03:45.840> advanced<00:03:46.080> only<00:03:46.320> took<00:03:46.440> me<00:03:46.590> a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
slightly more advanced only took me a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.920 
slightly more advanced only took me a
few<00:03:46.740> hours<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.730> I've<00:03:48.209> only<00:03:48.390> got<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> few<00:03:48.750> simple

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
few hours and I've only got a few simple

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.750 
few hours and I've only got a few simple
machines<00:03:49.380> set<00:03:49.920> up<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.400> all<00:03:50.550> it<00:03:50.580> really

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
machines set up and that's all it really

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.600 
machines set up and that's all it really
took<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.080> have<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.380> large<00:03:52.709> iron<00:03:53.100> tank

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
took so here I have a large iron tank

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.720 
took so here I have a large iron tank
with<00:03:54.600> another<00:03:55.260> liquid<00:03:55.560> tesseract<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.520> top

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
with another liquid tesseract on top

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.540 
with another liquid tesseract on top
same<00:03:56.970> frequency<00:03:57.620> which<00:03:58.620> takes<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.040> liquid<00:03:59.430> out

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
same frequency which takes a liquid out

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.060 
same frequency which takes a liquid out
from<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.270> in<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> nether<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.020> puts<00:04:01.950> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
from the one in the nether and puts it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.050 
from the one in the nether and puts it
in<00:04:02.190> here<00:04:02.840> which<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:03.989> really<00:04:04.170> quite<00:04:04.320> simple<00:04:04.560> but

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
in here which is really quite simple but

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.350 
in here which is really quite simple but
a<00:04:06.060> lot<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.360> our<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.750> mind<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.700> down<00:04:08.850> here<00:04:08.910> is

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
a lot of our you mind so down here is

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.979 
a lot of our you mind so down here is
where<00:04:09.720> oh<00:04:10.020> my<00:04:10.350> or<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.130> say<00:04:11.880> all<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.360> few<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.900> my

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
where oh my or I say all a few of my

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.080 
where oh my or I say all a few of my
machines<00:04:13.320> are<00:04:13.560> um

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
machines are um

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.479 
machines are um
so<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.109> where<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.290> get<00:04:16.530> my<00:04:16.919> create<00:04:17.370> my

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
so this is where I get my create my

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.120 
so this is where I get my create my
energy<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.329> here<00:04:18.510> i<00:04:18.540> have<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.750> content<00:04:19.130> upgrade

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
energy so here i have a content upgrade

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.879 
energy so here i have a content upgrade
from<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.609> geothermal<00:04:20.970> generator<00:04:21.889> it

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
from the geothermal generator it

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.780 
from the geothermal generator it
produces<00:04:23.540> 30,000<00:04:24.540> EU<00:04:25.380> per<00:04:26.040> bucket<00:04:26.280> instead<00:04:26.610> of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
produces 30,000 EU per bucket instead of

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.680 
produces 30,000 EU per bucket instead of
20,000<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:30.389> holds<00:04:30.690> more<00:04:31.020> i<00:04:31.080> believe<00:04:31.530> and

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
20,000 and it holds more i believe and

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.300 
20,000 and it holds more i believe and
it's<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.870> set<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.199> there<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.620> i've<00:04:34.830> also<00:04:34.979> got

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
it's just set up there and i've also got

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.820 
it's just set up there and i've also got
the<00:04:35.790> knowledge<00:04:36.449> geothermal<00:04:37.080> generator<00:04:37.110> up

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the knowledge geothermal generator up

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.060 
the knowledge geothermal generator up
there<00:04:38.040> so<00:04:38.960> that's<00:04:39.960> pretty<00:04:40.410> much<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.710> it

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
there so that's pretty much it it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.560 
there so that's pretty much it it
doesn't<00:04:41.220> take<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.520> whole<00:04:41.729> lot<00:04:41.790> more<00:04:42.120> but<00:04:42.449> this

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
doesn't take a whole lot more but this

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.960 
doesn't take a whole lot more but this
produces<00:04:43.050> more<00:04:43.290> energy<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.830> that's<00:04:44.639> just<00:04:44.820> how

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
produces more energy and that's just how

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.270 
produces more energy and that's just how
I<00:04:45.000> set<00:04:45.419> my<00:04:45.570> system<00:04:45.990> I'm<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:46.800> I've<00:04:46.919> pretty<00:04:47.190> much

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
I set my system I'm so I've pretty much

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.930 
I set my system I'm so I've pretty much
got<00:04:47.610> infinite<00:04:48.120> energy<00:04:49.310> but<00:04:50.310> that's<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.700> so

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
got infinite energy but that's it so

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.890 
got infinite energy but that's it so
thank<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.930> for<00:04:51.960> watching<00:04:52.380> my<00:04:52.470> tutorials<00:04:53.070> I
