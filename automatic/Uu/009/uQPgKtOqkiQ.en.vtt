00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
okay this truck is going to be showing

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.860 
okay this truck is going to be showing
some<00:00:05.640> things<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.000> are<00:00:06.089> kind<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.420> take-off

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
some things that are kind of a take-off

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.940 
some things that are kind of a take-off
on<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.680> car<00:00:08.099> animation<00:00:08.639> one<00:00:08.880> tutorial

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
on the car animation one tutorial

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.839 
on the car animation one tutorial
incarnation<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.250> learned<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:11.700> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
incarnation one you learned about how to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.780 
incarnation one you learned about how to
keep<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.660> car<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.380> path<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> make

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
keep the car on a path and how to make

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.120 
keep the car on a path and how to make
the<00:00:15.030> wheels<00:00:15.240> turn<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:18.050> make<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.410> body

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the wheels turn and how to make the body

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
the wheels turn and how to make the body
lean<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.910> goes<00:00:21.029> around<00:00:21.180> corners<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
lean as it goes around corners and the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.330 
lean as it goes around corners and the
truck's<00:00:22.170> doing<00:00:22.529> all<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.160> also

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
truck's doing all that but it's also

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.980 
truck's doing all that but it's also
hitting<00:00:23.699> an<00:00:23.880> object<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> want<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> show

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
hitting an object and so I want to show

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
hitting an object and so I want to show
how<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.350> hit<00:00:25.740> an<00:00:25.890> object<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
how you can hit an object to make it

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.049 
how you can hit an object to make it
move<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> realistic<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.789> i'll<00:00:30.210> start<00:00:30.840> by

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
move in a realistic way so i'll start by

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
move in a realistic way so i'll start by
something<00:00:33.059> i'm<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> grab<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.440> box

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
something i'm going to grab this box

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
something i'm going to grab this box
that<00:00:35.130> i'm<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.430> i'm<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> change

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that i'm on i'm just going to change

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
that i'm on i'm just going to change
something<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.469> i'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> freeze

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
something about it i'm going to freeze

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
something about it i'm going to freeze
the<00:00:38.610> box<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.180> accidentally<00:00:39.750> move<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the box so don't accidentally move the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.850 
the box so don't accidentally move the
plane<00:00:40.950> i'm<00:00:41.129> working<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.629> i'll<00:00:42.629> say<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.500> show

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
plane i'm working on i'll say don't show

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.100 
plane i'm working on i'll say don't show
frozen<00:00:44.489> contents<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> grey<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.610> good

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
frozen contents in grey they are good

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
frozen contents in grey they are good
and<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.590> concentrate<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.460> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and so now I can concentrate on just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
and so now I can concentrate on just
moving<00:00:51.059> things<00:00:51.210> around<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.309> see<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
moving things around and so see all the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
moving things around and so see all the
keyframes<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.180> make<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> box<00:00:54.719> move<00:00:54.960> I'm

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
keyframes that make this box move I'm

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.049 
keyframes that make this box move I'm
going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> delete<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.670> we're<00:00:56.820> starting

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
going to delete those so we're starting

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
going to delete those so we're starting
in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> sense<00:00:57.690> from<00:00:57.870> scratch<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.190> only<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.879> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in a sense from scratch and only go to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
in a sense from scratch and only go to
the<00:01:00.000> top<00:01:00.210> viewport<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.379> what

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the top viewport so we can see what

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.570 
the top viewport so we can see what
we're<00:01:01.649> doing<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.830> probably<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> best<00:01:05.220> view

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we're doing and probably the best view

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.370 
we're doing and probably the best view
for<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> type<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> action<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.580> right<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
for this type of action and right here I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.039 
for this type of action and right here I
want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> move<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> box<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> I've<00:01:12.720> gotten

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
want to move this box so I've gotten

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
want to move this box so I've gotten
that<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> add<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> keyframe<00:01:14.100> right

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that I've got to add a keyframe right

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
that I've got to add a keyframe right
here's<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.479> thing<00:01:15.750> locks<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.409> until<00:01:16.830> this

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
here's this thing locks down until this

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.719 
here's this thing locks down until this
point<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.150> frame<00:01:19.020> 31<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> turn<00:01:20.580> on

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
point so frame 31 I'm going to turn on

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.899 
point so frame 31 I'm going to turn on
AutoKey<00:01:21.140> I've<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> box<00:01:22.920> selected<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
AutoKey I've got the box selected and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.690 
AutoKey I've got the box selected and
I'm<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> little<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> move

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.940 

and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.909> undo<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.560> I'm<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then undo it and I'm going to do a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.899 
and then undo it and I'm going to do a
little<00:01:32.880> bit<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> rotation<00:01:34.369> 5<00:01:35.369> degrees<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
little bit of rotation 5 degrees and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.300 
little bit of rotation 5 degrees and
then<00:01:35.970> come<00:01:36.210> back<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.110> I've<00:01:37.229> done<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
then come back so what I've done was is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.990 
then come back so what I've done was is
I've<00:01:38.630> caused<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.960> box<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:41.430> locked<00:01:41.790> down

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I've caused the box to be locked down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.760 
I've caused the box to be locked down
I've<00:01:42.360> nudged<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:44.820> its<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.600> space<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.409> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I've nudged it in in its in space and in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.260 
I've nudged it in in its in space and in
rotation<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.649> if<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.130> further<00:01:50.549> animation

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
rotation so if I do a further animation

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.749 
rotation so if I do a further animation
on<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.509> after<00:01:52.079> frame<00:01:52.320> 31<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.700> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
on this after frame 31 it's going to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
on this after frame 31 it's going to
animate<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.840> frame<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.649> wasn't<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
animate from that frame if I wasn't to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.730 
animate from that frame if I wasn't to
have<00:01:56.399> done<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.700> nudge<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
have done that nudge just now the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.080 
have done that nudge just now the
animation<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.399> started<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.850> frame<00:02:00.060> 0

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
animation would have started at frame 0

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
animation would have started at frame 0
and<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.869> you'd<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> car<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> truck

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and so you'd see the car or the truck

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
and so you'd see the car or the truck
approaching<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.509> thing<00:02:03.750> already

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
approaching and this thing already

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.499 
approaching and this thing already
turning<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> moving<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.180> which

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
turning and moving out of the way which

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
turning and moving out of the way which
is<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:07.200> unrealistic<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.289> frame<00:02:10.560> 32

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
is pretty unrealistic so now at frame 32

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.930 
is pretty unrealistic so now at frame 32
the<00:02:11.459> box<00:02:11.730> has<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.360> out<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.599> way

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the box has to get out of the way

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.190 
the box has to get out of the way
so<00:02:13.000> we're<00:02:13.120> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.300> go<00:02:13.360> ahead<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.780> rotate<00:02:14.140> it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so we're going to go ahead and rotate it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.950 
so we're going to go ahead and rotate it
a<00:02:14.380> little<00:02:14.500> bit<00:02:15.240> because<00:02:16.240> there's<00:02:16.690> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
a little bit because there's going to be

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.320 
a little bit because there's going to be
a<00:02:17.020> lot<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.230> push<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> truck<00:02:18.820> coming<00:02:19.210> on

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
a lot of push from the truck coming on

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.960 
a lot of push from the truck coming on
that<00:02:19.510> edge<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.080> corner<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> box<00:02:20.970> plus

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that edge on that corner of the box plus

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.000 
that edge on that corner of the box plus
we<00:02:22.330> need<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> move<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> away<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.740> probably

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
we need to move it away it's probably

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.260 
we need to move it away it's probably
going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.310> pushed<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.790> little<00:02:24.910> bit<00:02:25.120> like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
going to get pushed a little bit like

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.140 
going to get pushed a little bit like
this<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.100> let's<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.460> see<00:02:27.610> how<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.970> works

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
this so let's just see how that works

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.380 
this so let's just see how that works
and<00:02:28.540> we'll<00:02:28.900> scrub<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.650> look<00:02:30.160> that's<00:02:30.850> not<00:02:31.090> too

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
and we'll scrub and look that's not too

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.200 
and we'll scrub and look that's not too
bad<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:32.250> let's<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.310> go<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> next<00:02:33.820> frame

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
bad and let's just go the next frame

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.720 
bad and let's just go the next frame
what<00:02:34.450> would<00:02:34.570> happen<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> little<00:02:36.580> bit

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
what would happen here do a little bit

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.850 
what would happen here do a little bit
more<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.510> little<00:02:38.050> bit<00:02:38.110> more<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.530> spin

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
more that a little bit more of the spin

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.540 
more that a little bit more of the spin
and<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:40.630> would<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.230> probably<00:02:41.830> move<00:02:42.280> this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
and it would have to probably move this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.260 
and it would have to probably move this
way<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.530> got<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.710> use<00:02:44.920> your<00:02:44.950> own

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
way and you just got to use your own

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.110 
way and you just got to use your own
laws<00:02:46.270> logic<00:02:47.340> you're<00:02:48.340> figuring<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.850> out

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.430 

what's<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.390> nice<00:02:52.570> with<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.140> truck

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
what's really nice with this truck

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.380 
what's really nice with this truck
movement<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.130> can<00:02:54.310> hit<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.580> twice<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.240> we

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
movement is we can hit it twice if we

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.640 
movement is we can hit it twice if we
can<00:02:55.570> get<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:55.960> out<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> way<00:02:56.620> just

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
can get this thing out of the way just

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.460 
can get this thing out of the way just
right<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.180> first<00:02:58.360> pass<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.990> can<00:02:59.110> bump<00:02:59.320> it

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
right on the first pass we can bump it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.890 
right on the first pass we can bump it
again<00:02:59.770> with<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.070> tail<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.640> truck<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.870> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
again with the tail of the truck so I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.450 
again with the tail of the truck so I
think<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.470> really<00:03:02.650> makes<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> cool

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
think that really makes for a cool

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.440 
think that really makes for a cool
animation<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.650> let's<00:03:05.650> say<00:03:05.860> right<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:07.090> give

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
animation so let's say right here give

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.360 
animation so let's say right here give
it<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.600> little<00:03:07.780> bit<00:03:07.960> more<00:03:09.420> spin<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:12.160> little

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
it a little bit more spin and a little

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.260 
it a little bit more spin and a little
bit<00:03:12.490> more<00:03:12.640> push<00:03:12.910> out<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.210> way<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:15.270> that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
bit more push out of the way so that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.449 
bit more push out of the way so that
looking<00:03:17.020> right<00:03:17.290> there's<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.100> little<00:03:18.250> bit<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
looking right there's a little bit of

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.280 
looking right there's a little bit of
intersection<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.209> see<00:03:19.420> physically<00:03:20.140> that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
intersection you see physically that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.380 
intersection you see physically that
really<00:03:20.590> couldn't<00:03:20.890> happen<00:03:21.010> could<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.459> that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
really couldn't happen could it that

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.030 
really couldn't happen could it that
truck<00:03:22.690> can't<00:03:22.989> go<00:03:23.110> through<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> box<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.010> you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
truck can't go through the box so you

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.270 
truck can't go through the box so you
got<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.340> watch<00:03:24.489> out<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:24.790> those<00:03:25.800> let's<00:03:26.800> move<00:03:27.100> it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
got to watch out for those let's move it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.940 
got to watch out for those let's move it
a<00:03:27.340> little<00:03:27.370> bit<00:03:27.670> more

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.860 

and<00:03:36.489> still<00:03:36.879> got<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.540> it's<00:03:37.720> gone

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
and still got that going on it's gone

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.520 
and still got that going on it's gone
right<00:03:38.050> into<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.470> tire<00:03:38.800> if<00:03:39.540> if<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.599> box<00:03:41.170> had<00:03:41.500> a

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
right into the tire if if the box had a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.380 
right into the tire if if the box had a
little<00:03:41.769> bit<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> an<00:03:42.040> angle<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.879> can<00:03:43.180> see

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
little bit of an angle to it I can see

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.540 
little bit of an angle to it I can see
that<00:03:43.599> but<00:03:43.660> right<00:03:44.050> now<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.560> not<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:45.459> just

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
that but right now it's not it's just

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.390 
that but right now it's not it's just
not<00:03:45.879> feasible<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.440> tire<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.190> box

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
not feasible that the tire in the box

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.100 
not feasible that the tire in the box
would<00:03:48.580> intersect<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.269> you've<00:03:49.390> got<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.900> move

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
would intersect so you've got to move

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.009 
would intersect so you've got to move
them<00:03:50.410> until<00:03:50.769> they<00:03:50.860> don't<00:03:51.069> intersect<00:03:54.660> now<00:03:55.660> here

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
them until they don't intersect now here

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.259 
them until they don't intersect now here
we<00:03:56.170> get<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.560> move<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.890> again<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.970> would<00:03:58.120> say

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
we get to move it again and I would say

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.220 
we get to move it again and I would say
right<00:03:58.480> about<00:03:58.599> there<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.140> good<00:03:59.319> place<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:01.230> we

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
right about there is a good place so we

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.490 
right about there is a good place so we
can<00:04:02.380> spend<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.799> little<00:04:02.920> bit<00:04:03.099> more<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:04.500> push

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
can spend it a little bit more and push

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.170 
can spend it a little bit more and push
it<00:04:05.680> up<00:04:05.799> away<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.129> little<00:04:06.370> bit<00:04:06.489> now<00:04:06.879> it's<00:04:07.060> going

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
it up away a little bit now it's going

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.289 
it up away a little bit now it's going
to<00:04:07.269> be<00:04:07.420> more<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:08.130> upwards<00:04:09.130> movement<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
to be more of a upwards movement and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.729 
to be more of a upwards movement and
right<00:04:13.569> there<00:04:13.840> we<00:04:13.959> can<00:04:14.110> knock<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.319> again<00:04:14.709> I

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
right there we can knock it again I

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:26.960 
right there we can knock it again I
think

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.310 

and<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.600> course<00:04:27.660> it's<00:04:28.020> going<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.200> have<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and of course it's going to have a

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:37.850 
and of course it's going to have a
little<00:04:28.620> momentum<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:29.160> its<00:04:29.280> own<00:04:29.460> turn

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.920 

but<00:04:38.340> what<00:04:38.460> I'd<00:04:38.550> like<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.789> do<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.599> this

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
but what I'd like to do is is this

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.439 
but what I'd like to do is is this
little<00:04:40.259> movement<00:04:40.650> here<00:04:41.009> I<00:04:41.360> don't<00:04:42.360> want<00:04:42.659> it<00:04:42.810> to

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
little movement here I don't want it to

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.459 
little movement here I don't want it to
that<00:04:45.449> a<00:04:45.479> little<00:04:45.569> movement<00:04:45.930> right<00:04:46.139> in<00:04:46.289> there<00:04:46.439> I

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
that a little movement right in there I

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:47.749 
that a little movement right in there I
don't<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.949> too<00:04:47.129> much<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.490> I'll<00:04:47.580> tell<00:04:47.699> you

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
don't like too much and I'll tell you

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.399 
don't like too much and I'll tell you
one<00:04:48.000> thing<00:04:48.030> we<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.479> do<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.719> make<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.020> laser

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
one thing we can do to make this laser

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.520 
one thing we can do to make this laser
handle<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:51.449> can<00:04:51.479> see<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.169> some<00:04:52.379> of<00:04:52.409> these

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
handle you can see that some of these

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.890 
handle you can see that some of these
keyframes<00:04:52.800> are<00:04:53.129> kind<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.370> hard<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.610> see<00:04:53.939> so<00:04:54.810> you

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
keyframes are kind of hard to see so you

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.050 
keyframes are kind of hard to see so you
can<00:04:55.169> use<00:04:55.379> your<00:04:55.560> ctrl<00:04:56.159> +<00:04:56.550> Alt<00:04:56.669> key<00:04:56.789> on<00:04:56.939> your

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
can use your ctrl + Alt key on your

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.089 
can use your ctrl + Alt key on your
keyboard<00:04:57.389> and<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.199> your<00:04:58.349> route<00:04:58.530> right<00:04:58.860> mouse

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
keyboard and then your route right mouse

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.770 
keyboard and then your route right mouse
button<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.639> spread<00:04:59.879> those<00:05:00.150> out<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.539> I'll<00:05:00.659> do

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
button to spread those out and I'll do

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.909 
button to spread those out and I'll do
that<00:05:00.900> right<00:05:00.960> now<00:05:06.349> okay<00:05:07.349> you<00:05:07.409> can<00:05:07.530> see<00:05:07.650> how<00:05:07.740> much

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
that right now okay you can see how much

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.189 
that right now okay you can see how much
easier<00:05:08.129> it<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.879> those<00:05:09.090> red<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:09.780> green

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
easier it is to see those red and green

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.129 
easier it is to see those red and green
keys<00:05:10.680> red<00:05:11.639> four<00:05:11.879> move<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.449> green<00:05:12.659> for<00:05:12.870> rotate

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
keys red four move and green for rotate

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.409 
keys red four move and green for rotate
and<00:05:19.370> hear<00:05:20.370> what<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.580> think<00:05:20.819> I'm<00:05:20.939> going<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.120> do<00:05:21.270> is

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
and hear what I think I'm going to do is

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.469 
and hear what I think I'm going to do is
take<00:05:21.629> this<00:05:21.900> keyframe<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:26.060> just<00:05:27.060> going<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.300> do

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
take this keyframe and just going to do

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.820 
take this keyframe and just going to do
a<00:05:27.919> shift<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.370> drag<00:05:29.729> and<00:05:30.150> copy<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.779> so<00:05:31.770> now

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
a shift and drag and copy that so now

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.379 
a shift and drag and copy that so now
I've<00:05:31.919> copied<00:05:32.189> a<00:05:32.430> keyframe<00:05:32.819> so<00:05:33.090> it's<00:05:33.180> really

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
I've copied a keyframe so it's really

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.019 
I've copied a keyframe so it's really
stopped<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.259> Box<00:05:34.469> stops<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.099> a<00:05:35.129> second<00:05:35.580> and

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
stopped the Box stops for a second and

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.390 
stopped the Box stops for a second and
now<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.300> keeps<00:05:36.449> going<00:05:36.719> to<00:05:36.990> see<00:05:37.169> what<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.319> did<00:05:37.620> now

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
now it keeps going to see what I did now

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.129 
now it keeps going to see what I did now
it<00:05:38.520> looks<00:05:38.669> white<00:05:39.000> right<00:05:39.240> now<00:05:39.419> but<00:05:39.599> if<00:05:39.689> I<00:05:39.810> click

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
it looks white right now but if I click

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.959 
it looks white right now but if I click
anywhere<00:05:40.740> on<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.009> timeline<00:05:41.250> you'll<00:05:41.669> see<00:05:41.849> that

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
anywhere on the timeline you'll see that

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.300 
anywhere on the timeline you'll see that
it's<00:05:42.120> it's<00:05:42.900> still<00:05:43.259> a<00:05:43.289> red<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.710> green<00:05:43.889> kits<00:05:44.190> or

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
it's it's still a red and green kits or

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.249 
it's it's still a red and green kits or
it's<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.639> move<00:05:44.909> and<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.240> rotate<00:05:45.629> key<00:05:45.870> at<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> same

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
it's a move and a rotate key at the same

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.510 
it's a move and a rotate key at the same
place<00:05:46.469> I<00:05:49.520> think<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.580> works<00:05:50.940> pretty<00:05:51.300> good

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
place I think that works pretty good

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.010 
place I think that works pretty good
okay<00:05:53.520> so<00:05:53.580> let's<00:05:54.060> see<00:05:54.180> how<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:54.270> looks<00:05:54.389> like<00:05:54.750> in

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
okay so let's see how it looks like in

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.869 
okay so let's see how it looks like in
the<00:05:55.229> other<00:05:55.349> view<00:05:55.650> I'll<00:05:56.099> turn<00:05:56.250> off<00:05:56.310> auto<00:05:56.639> key

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
the other view I'll turn off auto key

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:03.719 
the other view I'll turn off auto key
for<00:05:57.089> a<00:05:57.150> second

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.549 

I'm<00:06:04.270> going<00:06:04.449> to<00:06:04.539> check<00:06:04.719> the<00:06:04.900> other<00:06:05.020> views<00:06:05.289> of

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:05.559 
I'm going to check the other views of

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.659 
I'm going to check the other views of
course<00:06:07.289> yeah<00:06:08.289> that's<00:06:08.650> probably<00:06:09.219> not<00:06:09.400> as<00:06:09.520> good

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
course yeah that's probably not as good

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.700 
course yeah that's probably not as good
as<00:06:09.759> it<00:06:09.849> was<00:06:09.999> the<00:06:10.150> first<00:06:10.330> time<00:06:10.659> but<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.469> course

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
as it was the first time but of course

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.230 
as it was the first time but of course
you<00:06:11.830> got<00:06:11.949> to<00:06:12.039> fine-tune<00:06:12.550> these<00:06:12.699> things<00:06:12.969> and<00:06:13.150> it

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
you got to fine-tune these things and it

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.749 
you got to fine-tune these things and it
takes<00:06:13.449> a<00:06:13.509> little<00:06:13.629> bit<00:06:13.779> of<00:06:13.839> time<00:06:17.189> now<00:06:18.189> we<00:06:18.279> can<00:06:18.550> go

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
takes a little bit of time now we can go

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.579 
takes a little bit of time now we can go
in<00:06:18.969> a<00:06:18.999> little<00:06:19.270> further<00:06:19.499> actually<00:06:20.499> I'm

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
in a little further actually I'm

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.519 
in a little further actually I'm
probably<00:06:20.770> running<00:06:21.129> out<00:06:21.339> of<00:06:21.370> time<00:06:21.789> here<00:06:21.849> so

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529 
probably running out of time here so

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.619 
probably running out of time here so
we'll<00:06:23.529> hit<00:06:23.949> the<00:06:24.099> next<00:06:24.490> piece<00:06:24.969> of<00:06:25.150> this<00:06:25.300> in<00:06:25.539> the

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
we'll hit the next piece of this in the

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.199 
we'll hit the next piece of this in the
next<00:06:25.809> video
