00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.869
 hello friends of the site on the small screen 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.119
 Today's interviewee is the most 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 beautiful and younger world 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.999
 Television at the moment I 'm wrong 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.660
 so there is no reason why the woman 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:31.210
 girl how many years september 16 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.969
 years with 77 is in the eye of the hurricane 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:41.020
 now it 's your life now with Lurdinha 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 pumping on a slab on the hill of the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:50.019
 German 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:53.109
 almost all my time playing it now 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.629
 It's charmed with you, it takes bruno more. 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.190
 I was afraid she said that she was going 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.109
 book for you had known as 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:05.350
 Dinho knows it will not be for the spin 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.270
 Even though I 'm hoping I do not know 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.830
 I know it 's that she reserves now but she 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.420
 It always surprises us every now and then. 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.280
 chapter is coming up a new thing 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.520
 when he came in to compose the money that 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.820
 You're not much different from the wheel. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.550
 difficult because of this 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.360
 difference to be almost the opposite of 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.490
 that I am 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.980
 so I guess what helped me the most was 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.470
 the text is now very full then 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.390
 this route gives you lots of information and 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.610
 In the beginning, we had the workshop 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 novel and we had a talk for girls 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.330
 Brother residents that helped me a lot 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.280
 when you guys what the character was going to be 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.060
 quite a character and sun 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740
 bothered 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.320
 I think it's expensive 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.689
 nino awning that all this is not me 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.270
 Bothered I think it was a sushi van 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.070
 and the taboo but I think we 're going to italy is the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 My job is what I like and it has a 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.610
 delivery if you deliver by 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.670
 character telling money is bruno 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.729
 so that's all right bruno 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.240
 I think so she is not she does not quite 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 be a girl that has this side more 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.319
 sensual but nothing that runs away from one of a 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.119
 of a girl 17 hours 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.970
 I think you have now have all this care 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.160
 for as long as you have one side of that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 quality is normal for a girl who 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.080
 lives in the favela that is 17 years old 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.549
 has all the old likes to display very 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.500
 body that you, for example, already 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.080
 received a proposal to use a journal 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.650
 in good shape is a bikini 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.760
 Do you accept what your life is like? 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.980
 professional in relation to this the bruna 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.970
 Marquezine can bikini beach to the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.680
 magazine cover 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 I think it all depends on how you 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.560
 Show me this, will not you? 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.349
 if it 's something that stays because it stays 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.750
 beautiful and that is not very different from 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.580
 Bruna and I do not see anything much but I think 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.980
 that those who have always have a care 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.840
 How are you going to introduce yourself, you know not to? 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.470
 to imply something else I have already said 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.190
 not too much 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.280
 I've said too many magazines I do not think 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.440
 which I always have if the proposal 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.660
 initial is good, we always try to change 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.790
 to do said record both sides 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.030
 now it's under 17 years old 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.609
 Marquezine likes funk, right? 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.370
 deep in the background the caches the player who 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.500
 came from the avaÃ­ I think not until we 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.489
 we have is that I listen to dwarf not that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.980
 listening music 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.540
 I think tati could average om knows 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.609
 this kind of music calmer more 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.209
 slow but I have everything on the phone 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.950
 there's an orange heard from the pagoda 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.889
 even a calmer song so do not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.410
 There is a problem with music, but I do not think so. 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.090
 a party was it that nothing is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.730
 responsible can not stand still 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.389
 so I 've never had ever liked one 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.030
 little 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.680
 a lot of people, a lot of people when I said 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.910
 to come talk to you see that 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.980
 long about his personal life 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.030
 Assisi was a request from bruna which was 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.620
 your request for me 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.390
 Bruna Marquezine 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.670
 I'm not very personal to my life . 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.069
 because I do not think there's a need 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.349
 What I have of most interesting to 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.129
 talk and expose my work but always 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.989
 it was so 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.000
 or just a while back, without it. 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.680
 It's because some time ago that the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 interest in my personal life has increased 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 the chaos years says neymar not said thing 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.730
 neymar because it is now growing 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.489
 each week is even a new boyfriend I 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.579
 take aim for things without knowing if 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.489
 July but the magazine group 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.260
 It's not normal for a boyfriend book to kiss on the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.060
 mouth is normal for those who are even more 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.250
 The city is only 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.560
 From here it is seen from a bad point for me 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.060
 the rhythm of bruno because you get going 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.729
 Having to stay normal now is bad for 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.419
 you show up staying with the boy or 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.760
 other 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.280
 this way if all because you just look there 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.080
 she is dating a nobody is sure 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
 did not understand yet that a week ago 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.680
 is dating another 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.800
 She is one week going out with another 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.760
 are fits and totally false and that's it 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.310
 You can mess up so much in my life. 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.900
 personal and gives a different image 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.970
 Wow, look, this girl, she's grown up. 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.229
 now it's taking I think when I 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.570
 relationship I 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.280
 I wish I could hold on to no more 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.930
 this is no doubt something of a time 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.030
 Because when I was a child, nobody 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.080
 I also had in my personal life is 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.660
 best things in there playing but nothing 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.270
 plus now and very friendly Chinese sasha 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.849
 She's a little sister, she'll always be mine. 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.080
 brother is playing and started this friendship 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.360
 very strong right? 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.039
 I went to work for work 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.349
 What I did with the shawl will take you to mine. 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.760
 home you play with sasha and I went to 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.810
 people ended up creating a very 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.050
 nice and I have a lot of affection 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.580
 great for her is a very nice person 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.260
 And when do you think it's going to be ready? 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.830
 to date if you think you 're ready to 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.349
 flirt 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.570
 I think if I never promised not to 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.510
 course in the final to be ready by 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.480
 now 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.460
 pedro ii now i'm ready this is the 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.530
 Moment I always what I think 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.000
 there is no time there is no phase 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.770
 to use this is the phase of my life 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720
 that I want for someone who when 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.060
 You bar with a person who is 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.650
 interesting that you like and this 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.650
 feeling is reciprocal I think it is 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.140
 inevitable you prepared yourself physically 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.420
 next novel had then always worked 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.300
 I always exercised but when I lived 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.670
 ronaldinha I think it 's a bit 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.220
 Then I got into a recipe that will close 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.590
 I'm going to work harder and I think people 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.750
 they saw this difference they saw a bruna 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.850
 Marquezine different is why I think 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.280
 all my other characters displays 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.440
 then displays of the body so you watch 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.080
 you was with tiny or not see 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.080
 for days while it is not the question 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.480
 that public claim of nostalgia 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.430
 videos we know how I got better 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.340
 there is undoubtedly no doubt that the 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.610
 public can see this was one of the 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.220
 better things that adds up front 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.630
 to the small screen this is very good for me 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.550
 that the public sees both in growth 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.250
 all the physical changes at last 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.830
 turn your personal but there is a 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.910
 growth as an actress of revolution 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.520
 I see our work on our day. 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.030
 Make me cry, I think it's easier to talk. 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.180
 what to do 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:01.280
 River you think the key but praises what 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.570
 No, no, no, no. 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.330
 It's just dust, it's because she's ahead. 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.120
 she is a very 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.790
 personality she won a medal 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.310
 I think it 's way ahead you want to know 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.650
 now what do you want to happen like 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.470
 the day they want a neighbor's house 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.500
 there is nothing specifically so that the 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.830
 I want to leave a compliment to stay 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.490
 famous in the agenda because it is produced 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.730
 voice connected to Joseph is great and this is great 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.650
 Look the day could get famous, it's okay. 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.360
 I think it's amazing 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.470
 thank you bruna came from your fans 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.560
 I thank you for the affection and the 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.560
 support
