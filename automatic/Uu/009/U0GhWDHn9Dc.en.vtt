00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 [Music] 

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello my name is raul roa today I want 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.900
 share with you how to hold 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.880
 cutting scissors correctly but 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 these ballad techniques that come without 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.490
 glamor to each of the strokes that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 perform in the design of the cut 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.340
 the scissors always hold with this 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.279
 crime here and here is going to rest for 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.580
 to be able to handle the fat little finger very well 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.919
 that enters the thimble but does not enter 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.269
 completely inside only the tip 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.270
 to go up and down and create a good cut 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.160
 of hair 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.310
 because we do not put all the finger because 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 you lose ergonomics of the wrist if you do not 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.309
 can 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.789
 give this movement because if you put it in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 everything will be much more difficult 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.420
 then putting it only the tip 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 of the finger 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.670
 it was the whole economy 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.350
 also when we are performing 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.689
 texture how are you going to see in the videos 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.810
 when we are doing texture is 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.600
 much easier because the hair should 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.979
 be totally parallel to the sense of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.009
 the scissors so that you are not going to create 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.039
 spaces that we do not want but must 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.830
 enter will create texture and obviously 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.530
 it's not going to work very well when I'm 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.420
 working on long hair the size 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.220
 also the scissors may vary 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.640
 depending on tastes to see our base 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.130
 the 6.5 and by this way of my hand and to the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.799
 7.5 and Spain very big hand but 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.440
 Degenerate activity 7 points and if 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.170
 you have a smaller hand then 6 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.869
 5.5 inches if you have a very hand 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.740
 little one works fine but to me 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.690
 they love 6.5 because in the area of cuts 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.789
 much bigger and the process is 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 much prettier good we go with this 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.310
 way to take the scissors the other one is like 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.159
 save it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.710
 because you are working and a 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.049
 client uses yes sir please follow 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.570
 it's aggressive because you have an object 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.970
 cortopunzante here the ideal is to save it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.670
 you drop it on your finger and the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.760
 you guard to get them out simply put 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.420
 the finger here does not go up and you already have your 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.069
 scissors to work or just the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.129
 turn here 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 you turn this movement you can 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.180
 do with a paper scissors for 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.859
 train so you do not have your scissors 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.319
 good and suddenly they can leave 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.019
 fired and obviously you can fall 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.520
 then you do not train to return 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.960
 scissors to place 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 we already turn it back 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.670
 the other is to slide there are people 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 what they do in this way that tires you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 shoulder and tighten the elbow and you can have 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.580
 an injury the ideal is to work the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.760
 this way and do not repeat it again what 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.640
 you have here you get it here you put it 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.520
 is here and you turn the scissors remaining 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.400
 totally vertical where you go to 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.210
 work this form of hoisting where 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.790
 you have all the control to perform and 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.560
 obviously it's much easier to 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.100
 holding only with these three 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.320
 fingers and your finger works for you to do 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.660
 a larger cut you can cut out of this 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.570
 shape 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.840
 and if he told you he has already lost customers you 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.090
 you can go slowly cutting 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.520
 cutting slowly but if you have a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.700
 high-end scissors like butter 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.070
 We have how to cut with a knife 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.500
 hot on butter that easy 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.780
 is a scissor win then the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
 recommendation is to have good scissors 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.610
 to make good cuts and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.770
 handle the scissor posture your hand 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.010
 its also gives you an image that 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.430
 supremely professional 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:58.440
 then let's remember the movements 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.830
 and nothing thank you very much and we are 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.680
 seeing 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.770
 thanks for subscribing thank you for your 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770
