premier<00:00:15.340> manager<00:00:15.670> games<00:00:15.880> quite<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.270> lot<00:00:16.480> in<00:00:16.630> the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
premier manager games quite a lot in the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.740 
premier manager games quite a lot in the
last<00:00:16.750> few<00:00:16.990> weeks<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.619> I<00:00:18.270> think<00:00:19.270> I've<00:00:19.420> come<00:00:19.599> to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
last few weeks and I think I've come to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.830 
last few weeks and I think I've come to
some<00:00:19.960> sort<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.439> conclusion<00:00:20.680> about<00:00:21.430> them<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
some sort of conclusion about them and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.470 
some sort of conclusion about them and
this<00:00:23.050> video<00:00:23.410> contains<00:00:23.950> my<00:00:24.460> thoughts<00:00:24.849> on<00:00:25.150> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
this video contains my thoughts on the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.420 
this video contains my thoughts on the
premiere<00:00:25.840> manager<00:00:26.140> series<00:00:26.349> for<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.220> Mega

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
premiere manager series for the Mega

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.220 
premiere manager series for the Mega
Drive<00:00:27.849> that<00:00:28.570> I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:31.480> I'll<00:00:31.599> start<00:00:31.869> off<00:00:31.989> by

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
Drive that I think I'll start off by

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.410 
Drive that I think I'll start off by
saying<00:00:32.259> straight<00:00:32.860> away<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.190> these<00:00:33.880> earn<00:00:34.120> as

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
saying straight away that these earn as

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.889 
saying straight away that these earn as
good<00:00:34.780> as<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.620> championship<00:00:36.100> manager<00:00:36.430> series

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
good as the championship manager series

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.350 
good as the championship manager series
which<00:00:37.899> is<00:00:38.140> was<00:00:38.739> a<00:00:38.770> big<00:00:39.130> franchise<00:00:39.820> around<00:00:40.210> at

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
which is was a big franchise around at

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.510 
which is was a big franchise around at
the<00:00:40.480> time<00:00:40.510> but<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.410> think<00:00:41.680> it<00:00:41.800> will<00:00:41.920> be<00:00:41.980> quite

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
the time but I think it will be quite

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280 
the time but I think it will be quite
unfair<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.240> compare<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.810> two<00:00:43.960> because

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
unfair to compare the two because

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.780 
unfair to compare the two because
essentially<00:00:44.740> they're<00:00:45.490> on<00:00:45.610> different

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
essentially they're on different

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.740 
essentially they're on different
consoles<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.720> are<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:46.930> different<00:00:47.640> formats

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
consoles that are on different formats

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.410 
consoles that are on different formats
so<00:00:49.750> whereas<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.770> pc<00:00:51.160> versions<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:52.000> more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
so whereas the pc versions a more

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.800 
so whereas the pc versions a more
capable<00:00:52.630> of<00:00:53.050> having<00:00:53.320> statistics<00:00:54.190> based

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
capable of having statistics based

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.230 
capable of having statistics based
information<00:00:55.810> based<00:00:56.670> holding<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.760> lot<00:00:57.880> of<00:00:58.000> data

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
information based holding a lot of data

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.170 
information based holding a lot of data
on<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.690> hard<00:00:58.720> drives<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.980> Mega<00:01:00.520> Drive<00:01:00.880> is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
on the hard drives the Mega Drive is

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.510 
on the hard drives the Mega Drive is
just<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.570> 16-bit<00:01:02.170> cartridge<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.040> can<00:01:03.370> only

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
just a 16-bit cartridge and can only

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.710 
just a 16-bit cartridge and can only
hold<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.059> limited<00:01:04.509> amount<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.930> data<00:01:06.720> taking

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
hold the limited amount of data taking

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.749 
hold the limited amount of data taking
that<00:01:07.750> into<00:01:08.049> consideration<00:01:08.250> these<00:01:09.250> games<00:01:09.610> are

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
that into consideration these games are

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.770 
that into consideration these games are
actually<00:01:10.150> quite<00:01:10.329> good<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:12.299> mean<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.659> only

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
actually quite good I mean the only

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.809 
actually quite good I mean the only
other<00:01:14.049> top<00:01:14.350> four<00:01:14.590> divisions<00:01:15.069> were<00:01:15.340> as<00:01:15.579> like

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
other top four divisions were as like

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.419 
other top four divisions were as like
the<00:01:16.240> pc<00:01:16.630> versions<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.289> got<00:01:17.499> the<00:01:17.920> conference

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
the pc versions have got the conference

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:19.800 
the pc versions have got the conference
and<00:01:18.579> a<00:01:18.640> couple<00:01:18.819> of<00:01:18.969> other<00:01:19.090> leagues<00:01:19.359> in<00:01:19.600> there

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
and a couple of other leagues in there

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.529 
and a couple of other leagues in there
and<00:01:20.020> actually<00:01:20.409> a<00:01:20.649> couple<00:01:20.979> more<00:01:21.159> features<00:01:21.549> this

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
and actually a couple more features this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.489 
and actually a couple more features this
is<00:01:22.749> a<00:01:22.780> bit<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.200> stripped-down<00:01:23.829> version<00:01:24.359> but

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
is a bit of a stripped-down version but

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.620 
is a bit of a stripped-down version but
it's<00:01:26.499> still<00:01:26.770> very<00:01:26.829> good<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.549> retains<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.359> lot<00:01:28.509> of

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
it's still very good it retains a lot of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.550 
it's still very good it retains a lot of
the<00:01:29.429> addictiveness<00:01:30.429> a<00:01:30.819> lot<00:01:31.329> of<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.600> appeal<00:01:32.380> of

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
the addictiveness a lot of the appeal of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.809 
the addictiveness a lot of the appeal of
the<00:01:32.859> pc<00:01:33.249> versions<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:36.310> it's<00:01:36.579> going<00:01:36.759> to

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
the pc versions and yeah it's going to

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.239 
the pc versions and yeah it's going to
feel<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.090> bit<00:01:37.389> limited<00:01:37.929> every<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.380> often<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.889> mean

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
feel a bit limited every so often I mean

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.160 
feel a bit limited every so often I mean
if<00:01:39.639> you've<00:01:39.909> ever<00:01:40.030> played<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.450> pc<00:01:40.810> versions

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
if you've ever played the pc versions

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.980 
if you've ever played the pc versions
are<00:01:41.319> any<00:01:41.560> pc<00:01:42.280> football<00:01:42.789> management<00:01:43.149> gear<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
are any pc football management gear and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.149 
are any pc football management gear and
then<00:01:44.139> you<00:01:44.289> can<00:01:44.409> be<00:01:44.590> able<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.829> tell<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
then you can be able to tell the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.029 
then you can be able to tell the
difference<00:01:45.189> right<00:01:45.639> away<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.649> you've<00:01:47.829> got<00:01:48.009> to

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
difference right away but you've got to

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.099 
difference right away but you've got to
going<00:01:48.700> back<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.119> again<00:01:49.299> you've<00:01:49.810> got<00:01:49.990> to

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
going back to this again you've got to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.870 
going back to this again you've got to
actually<00:01:50.560> remember<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.009> time<00:01:51.340> at<00:01:51.520> which<00:01:51.639> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
actually remember the time at which the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
actually remember the time at which the
games<00:01:52.090> came<00:01:52.420> out<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:53.380> was<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.130> first

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
games came out this was the first

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.379 
games came out this was the first
football<00:01:56.259> management<00:01:56.770> series<00:01:57.189> on<00:01:57.609> a<00:01:57.670> console

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
football management series on a console

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.510 
football management series on a console
I<00:01:59.579> think<00:02:00.579> about<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.880> for<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.119> minute

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I think about that for a minute

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.270 
I think about that for a minute
it's<00:02:03.520> pretty<00:02:03.700> brown<00:02:04.270> brick<00:02:04.720> in<00:02:04.960> his<00:02:05.079> name<00:02:05.290> now

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
it's pretty brown brick in his name now

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.699 
it's pretty brown brick in his name now
I<00:02:06.310> will<00:02:06.520> concede<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.240> console<00:02:08.140> management

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
I will concede the console management

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.699 
I will concede the console management
games<00:02:09.239> whilst<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.509> amp<00:02:10.660> come<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.080> quite<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> bit

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
games whilst the amp come on quite a bit

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.650 
games whilst the amp come on quite a bit
in<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.920> last<00:02:11.950> ten<00:02:12.340> years<00:02:12.370> they've<00:02:13.239> never<00:02:13.510> been

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
in the last ten years they've never been

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.610 
in the last ten years they've never been
as<00:02:14.020> good<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.520> pc<00:02:15.880> versions<00:02:16.410> at<00:02:17.410> least

quite a lot and I think it deserves some

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.710 
quite a lot and I think it deserves some
recognition<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.150> book<00:02:46.420> any

recognition for that when in my book any

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.620 
recognition for that when in my book any
