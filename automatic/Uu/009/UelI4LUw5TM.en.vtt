00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
see it at the cinema and for me it's the

I<00:03:17.019> thought<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> long<00:03:17.620> time<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.700> know<00:03:18.790> as

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
I thought for a long time you know as

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.479 
I thought for a long time you know as
watching<00:03:19.180> all<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.390> summer<00:03:19.569> blockbusters

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
watching all the summer blockbusters

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.020 
watching all the summer blockbusters
there<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.579> no<00:03:21.959> real<00:03:22.959> big<00:03:23.260> sleeper<00:03:23.829> hit<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
there was no real big sleeper hit I

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
there was no real big sleeper hit I
think<00:03:25.629> this<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:26.680> considered<00:03:27.190> a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
think this really can be considered a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.000 
think this really can be considered a
sleeper<00:03:27.670> hit<00:03:27.849> because<00:03:28.600> we'd<00:03:29.530> been<00:03:29.709> burnt

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
sleeper hit because we'd been burnt

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.300 
sleeper hit because we'd been burnt
