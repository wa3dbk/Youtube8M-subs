00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that would entail right but I guess this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.080 
that would entail right but I guess this
whole<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.049> based<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.759> not<00:01:50.759> being

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
whole thing is based in not being

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
whole thing is based in not being
rational<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.869> based<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.500> taking

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
rational it's based in not it's taking

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
rational it's based in not it's taking
that<00:01:53.250> leap<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> same<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that leap if it's the same thing is the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
that leap if it's the same thing is the
belief<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.259> God<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> way<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:56.369> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
religion who do believe in ghosts
for<00:02:14.160> me<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.580> believe<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.690> coping

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
for me I believe that it's a coping

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
for me I believe that it's a coping
mechanism<00:02:16.140> right<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.070> think<00:02:17.220> about<00:02:17.460> someone

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
mechanism right so I think about someone

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360 
mechanism right so I think about someone
in<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:18.660> family<00:02:18.870> I'm<00:02:19.500> not<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.740> say<00:02:19.980> who<00:02:20.160> but

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
in my family I'm not gonna say who but

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.350 
in my family I'm not gonna say who but
she<00:02:21.410> lost<00:02:22.410> other<00:02:22.980> family<00:02:23.670> members<00:02:24.000> when<00:02:24.210> she

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
she lost other family members when she

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.510 
she lost other family members when she
was<00:02:24.480> younger<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.050> her<00:02:25.740> way<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.950> coping<00:02:26.280> with

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
was younger and her way of coping with

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.060 
was younger and her way of coping with
that<00:02:26.790> loss<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.990> belief<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:28.770> one

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
that loss was the belief that at one

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.280 
that loss was the belief that at one
point<00:02:29.100> after<00:02:29.850> her<00:02:30.300> life<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.630> over<00:02:30.930> she<00:02:31.140> will

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
point after her life is over she will

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
point after her life is over she will
reunite<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.010> reconnect<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.790> those<00:02:32.940> people

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
reunite and reconnect with those people

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.960 
reunite and reconnect with those people
every<00:02:34.020> time<00:02:34.200> she's<00:02:34.410> having<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.830> bad<00:02:35.220> day<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
every time she's having a bad day and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.610 
every time she's having a bad day and
then<00:02:36.150> she<00:02:36.360> dreams<00:02:36.750> about<00:02:36.930> those<00:02:37.260> people<00:02:37.440> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
then she dreams about those people that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.080 
then she dreams about those people that
she<00:02:37.890> lost<00:02:38.100> she<00:02:38.250> thinks<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:38.970> sort

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
she lost she thinks that that some sort

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.850 
she lost she thinks that that some sort
of<00:02:39.210> sign<00:02:39.480> from<00:02:39.720> God<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.290> know<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
of sign from God you know that that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
of sign from God you know that that
she's<00:02:41.040> reconnecting<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:41.850> them<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.330> some

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
she's reconnecting with them on some

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.530 
she's reconnecting with them on some
deeper<00:02:43.110> level<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.860> III<00:02:44.400> think<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
deeper level so III think that there is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.170 
deeper level so III think that there is
a<00:02:45.960> positive<00:02:46.290> purpose<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.250> religion<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
a positive purpose for religion for the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.790 
a positive purpose for religion for the
people<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.570> do<00:02:48.690> believe<00:02:48.960> in<00:02:49.080> God<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.560> believe

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
people that do believe in God do believe

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.290 
people that do believe in God do believe
in<00:02:49.920> an<00:02:50.010> afterlife<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.880> coping<00:02:51.090> mechanism

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
in an afterlife it's a coping mechanism

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.050 
in an afterlife it's a coping mechanism
but<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.440> said<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:53.130> still<00:02:53.310> bananas

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
but with that said it's still bananas

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
but with that said it's still bananas
because<00:02:54.330> there's<00:02:54.660> absolutely<00:02:55.020> no<00:02:55.170> proven

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530

way<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.140> interpret<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.970> introjection<00:03:39.780> of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380

makes<00:03:42.989> perfect<00:03:43.410> sense<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:44.310> there's<00:03:44.820> also<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
makes perfect sense but there's also a

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.790 
makes perfect sense but there's also a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
that's an interjection of the people who

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.840 
that's an interjection of the people who
are<00:03:48.660> dead<00:03:48.930> that's<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:50.010> see<00:03:50.280> how<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.700> useful
