00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.950
 can drown out the index finger then 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.950

 fingers exactly the same as d 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:47.570
 only we move the arm for 1 watt that is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.980
 at that there is a barrier we have on the fourth 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.220
 fret 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:03:00.290
 fingers on the sixth 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:13.780
 so with us as we have it sounds and so 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:13.780
 I lose the intro and suddenly em a hm 7 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.349
 center m 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.370
 again 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.430
 here is a 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.769
 wrong 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.630
 and so what sequence 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.150
 this is the first part ie the first half 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.230
 joining the second half NTRY 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.069
 back to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.069
 fm losing literally starting too 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:12.860
 so with in the second half of the entry we 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.860
 from the hm 7 chord go to d and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.540
 go to the whole 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.500
 so verse and chorus 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.600
 the whole song is played exactly the same 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:45.010
 sequence as in the introduction 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:05:03.620
 just another fight and so what and so 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:05:05.860
 which bout of programs are slowly returning 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.860
 on 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:49.550
 so 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:55.880
 lose all together so in the chord about 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:59.320
 the chords c &amp; h solved and d we spend on 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.320
 strings once fast 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.350
 so I lose 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.350
 once again all the very beginning 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.820

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:26.500
 and so in pace 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.750
