00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Welcome to another video I was 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 pokemon and banesto that was delivered another 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.899
 video pokemon blond information me of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.940
 alpha sapphire we could call it true 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 way like this and is that this time they can 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.599
 see that it has just been confirmed 100% 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.969
 the mega evolution or failing to the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.160
 primeval form of mega ray house or in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.570
 its fault the primeval ray cuasa and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 You can see in the image that I will show to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.039
 then which is filtered is a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 filtered image of evolution 2 can 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.250
 see that here we have a lot of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 pokemon which are some way 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.300
 green as if they were evolving 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 as if in this bunch of pokemon 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.870
 had something in common with each other that makes 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.940
 why is this because these because 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.380
 they had to be together they can see that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 we have stripes can see that we have 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.420
 below you can see that we have abel of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.340
 onslow by acb like a ground and here I 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.649
 see everything they have something in common 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.270
 with each other this is because they maintain medium 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.309
 failing evolved have a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 primal form can see that too 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 Here we have the guides that beats Asia 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 for a lot of time we know 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.780
 already by itself that has mega evolution 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.579
 but you can see that in one part 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 top appears rail guasa 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 This is how quasar root appears , which 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 will give enough information waves 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.490
 enough beliefs to know that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 this pokemon will have its mega evolution or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.140
 in its defect its original form the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 which we will see inside this great anime 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 so nintendo shows us that he 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 He also knows how to make anime even though 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.460
 yes the anime of pokemon is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.800
 conventional to those who already have us 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 accustomed are not at all good at 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 comparison these little gems that 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.140
 from time to time it is taken out and in this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.030
 you can see that it is like doing 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.580
 a small room the gigantic 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.560
 jewel since it will be confirming the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.070
 half evolution or failing the form 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 primeval of mega ray kwassa kwassa 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.620
