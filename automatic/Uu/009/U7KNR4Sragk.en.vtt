00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
patent was made in 1894 I believe if you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.230 
patent was made in 1894 I believe if you
can't<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.329> says<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.320> pent<00:01:47.040> in

1894<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> original<00:01:51.320> just

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
1894 so this is one of the original just

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.649 
1894 so this is one of the original just
insanely<00:01:53.670> crazy<00:01:54.299> concepts<00:01:56.570> for<00:01:57.570> typewriters

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
