and E on the right hand now we press the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.050 
and E on the right hand now we press the
base<00:01:06.260> together<00:01:06.740> with<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> right<00:01:07.310> hat<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.880> we

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
base together with the right hat and we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.609 
base together with the right hat and we
keep<00:01:08.300> moving<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.900> right<00:01:08.990> hand<00:01:09.290> up<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.530> down

so<00:01:10.009> one<00:01:10.280> two<00:01:10.910> three<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.050> I<00:01:12.820> always<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.210> a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
so one two three and I always it's a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.510 
so one two three and I always it's a
good<00:01:14.600> idea<00:01:14.840> whenever<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.740> right<00:01:15.890> hand<00:01:16.190> is<00:01:16.310> up

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
good idea whenever the right hand is up

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.749 
good idea whenever the right hand is up
to<00:01:17.300> use<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.050> key<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.560> left<00:01:18.950> hand<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
to use the key of the left hand with the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.080 
to use the key of the left hand with the
first<00:01:20.000> thing<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.450> usually<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:22.520> with<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> first

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
first thing it usually is with the first

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.060 
first thing it usually is with the first
finger<00:01:23.300> or<00:01:23.570> sometimes<00:01:23.990> with<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.289> second

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
finger or sometimes with the second

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.190 
finger or sometimes with the second
finger<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:25.940> for<00:01:26.149> sure<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.420> not<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.660> base<00:01:26.869> so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
finger but for sure is not the base so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.810 
finger but for sure is not the base so
always<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.740> start<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.310> base<00:01:28.550> on<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
always we start with a base on the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.120 
always we start with a base on the
right-hand<00:01:29.170> keep<00:01:30.170> moving<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> right<00:01:30.770> hand<00:01:31.039> up

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
right-hand keep moving the right hand up

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.999 
right-hand keep moving the right hand up
and<00:01:31.280> down<00:01:31.369> 1<00:01:32.030> 2<00:01:32.479> 3<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.600> compresses<00:01:36.410> see<00:01:36.680> when

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
and down 1 2 3 and compresses see when

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.080 
and down 1 2 3 and compresses see when
the<00:01:37.160> right<00:01:37.310> time<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.670> up<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.090> 1<00:01:38.450> 2<00:01:39.020> 3<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.090> then

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the right time is up so 1 2 3 and then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.270 
the right time is up so 1 2 3 and then
the<00:01:41.240> four<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.899> another<00:01:42.259> course<00:01:42.649> of<00:01:42.830> duty<00:01:43.899> 4<00:01:45.280> so

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the four is another course of duty 4 so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.070 
the four is another course of duty 4 so
from<00:01:46.550> see<00:01:46.789> we<00:01:46.970> got<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.210> deep<00:01:47.630> minor<00:01:48.610> D<00:01:49.630> D<00:01:50.630> on<00:01:50.929> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
from see we got a deep minor D D on the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.719 
from see we got a deep minor D D on the
left<00:01:51.289> hand<00:01:51.619> right<00:01:52.009> hand<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:53.500> a.d.f<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.400> just

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
left hand right hand is a.d.f so just

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.320 
left hand right hand is a.d.f so just
press<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.210> score<00:01:56.570> both<00:01:56.869> hands

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330

one<00:01:59.290> two<00:01:59.890> three

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:16.490 

and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.450> we'll<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.050> mind<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and then we'll go to a mind for so this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.660 
and then we'll go to a mind for so this
is<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.800> minor<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.960> E<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.860> left<00:02:20.100> hand<00:02:20.370> on

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
is a minor a and E on the left hand on

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.610 
is a minor a and E on the left hand on
the<00:02:21.240> right<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.750> C<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.709> E<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:25.110> again<00:02:25.410> what

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the right is a C and E so again what

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.670 
the right is a C and E so again what
started<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.100> base<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> right

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
started with a base going on the right

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
started with a base going on the right
hand<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.050> pressed<00:02:31.380> me<00:02:32.330> when<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
hand one and we pressed me when the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.190 
hand one and we pressed me when the
right<00:02:33.660> hand<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.500> one<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:35.640> three<00:02:36.570> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
right hand is up to one two three and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:52.250 
right hand is up to one two three and
four<00:02:38.010> your<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.910> G<00:02:39.300> instead<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.959> pay

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.910 

so<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.040> idea<00:02:54.239> including<00:02:55.239> drop

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
so this is the idea including drop

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.330 
so this is the idea including drop
something<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:57.370> will<00:02:57.550> also<00:02:57.910> use<00:02:58.090> later<00:02:58.959> on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
something that we will also use later on

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.740 
something that we will also use later on
clever<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.670> let's<00:03:00.910> play<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.239> your<00:03:01.269> time<00:03:01.569> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
clever so let's play on your time the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.120 
clever so let's play on your time the
introduction<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:02.620> see<00:03:03.660> 3d<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.980> two<00:03:06.519> three

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:21.970 

and<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.850> see

is the prayer so the first is exactly
the<00:03:29.420> same<00:03:29.599> with<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.989> intro<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:32.510> is

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
the same with the intro and there is

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.350 
the same with the intro and there is
also<00:03:32.840> an<00:03:33.049> additional<00:03:33.560> part<00:03:33.830> we<00:03:34.190> will<00:03:34.330> play<00:03:35.330> it

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
also an additional part we will play it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.130 
also an additional part we will play it
right<00:03:35.959> after<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.819> beginning<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.870> verse

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
right after the beginning of the verse

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.630 
right after the beginning of the verse
so<00:03:39.950> C<00:03:40.910> major<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:42.410> is<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.650> verse<00:03:42.890> Rihanna<00:03:43.370> has

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
so C major this is the verse Rihanna has

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.860 
so C major this is the verse Rihanna has
already<00:03:43.819> started<00:03:44.269> singled<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.019> C<00:03:45.349> major<00:03:45.530> here

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
already started singled in C major here

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:58.250 
already started singled in C major here
three

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.520 

with<00:03:58.620> Lady<00:03:58.920> spiral<00:03:59.489> intro<00:03:59.939> four<00:04:00.239> times<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:01.319> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
with Lady spiral intro four times in the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:13.270 
with Lady spiral intro four times in the
verse<00:04:02.030> mr.<00:04:03.030> segment<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.129> third

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.710 

this<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.000> fourth

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
this is the fourth

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.449 
this is the fourth
you

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.760 

you

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.290 

and<00:04:22.949> now<00:04:23.069> we<00:04:23.129> have<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.520> part<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> verse

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and now we have this part of the verse

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.309 
and now we have this part of the verse
that<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.300> additional<00:04:27.690> part<00:04:28.050> right<00:04:28.289> here

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
that is the additional part right here

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.170 
that is the additional part right here
so<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.039> second<00:04:29.370> part<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.759> verse<00:04:29.910> F<00:04:30.810> major

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
so the second part of the verse F major

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.059 
so the second part of the verse F major
D<00:04:33.180> minor<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.599> this<00:04:36.599> a<00:04:36.870> we<00:04:37.289> know<00:04:37.620> very<00:04:37.650> well

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
D minor and a this a we know very well

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.309 
D minor and a this a we know very well
how<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.310> make<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:38.879> is<00:04:39.120> exactly<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> same<00:04:40.110> like

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
how to make it is exactly the same like

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.200 
how to make it is exactly the same like
before

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.659 

so<00:04:45.900> we<00:04:46.199> have<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.500> explain<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.889> f<00:04:47.280> here<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.210> d<00:04:49.669> ng

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
so we have to explain it f here and d ng

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.200 
so we have to explain it f here and d ng
right<00:04:50.940> here<00:04:51.210> at<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.479> end<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.810> verse<00:04:52.669> so

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
right here at the end of the verse so

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.010 
right here at the end of the verse so
so<00:04:56.580> in<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.759> second<00:04:58.210> part<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.630> first<00:04:58.660> we'll

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
so in the second part of the first we'll

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.920 
so in the second part of the first we'll
start<00:04:59.139> with<00:04:59.470> F<00:04:59.729> this<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:00.940> math<00:05:01.210> major<00:05:01.600> or<00:05:01.900> a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
start with F this is math major or a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.370 
start with F this is math major or a
digit<00:05:02.289> with<00:05:02.580> FF<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:05.310> cmf<00:05:08.039> now<00:05:09.039> left<00:05:09.310> hand<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.699> FF

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
digit with FF a cmf now left hand is FF

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.230 
digit with FF a cmf now left hand is FF
again<00:05:11.380> is<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> same<00:05:11.919> idea<00:05:12.460> we<00:05:12.759> start<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.150> a

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
again is the same idea we start with a

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.370 
again is the same idea we start with a
base<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:14.380> mark<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.009> right<00:05:15.160> hand<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:16.380> keep

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
base the mark on the right hand on keep

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.499 
base the mark on the right hand on keep
moving<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.979> right<00:05:18.099> hand<00:05:18.370> up<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.639> down<00:05:18.759> one

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
moving the right hand up and down one

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.460 
moving the right hand up and down one
two<00:05:20.169> three<00:05:20.590> four<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.789> you<00:05:22.449> can<00:05:22.630> press<00:05:22.900> this<00:05:23.139> F

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
two three four and you can press this F

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.339 
two three four and you can press this F
while<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.460> right<00:05:24.580> hands<00:05:24.880> up<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.419> one<00:05:25.720> two

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
while the right hands up so one two

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.870 
while the right hands up so one two
three<00:05:26.919> four<00:05:27.960> then<00:05:28.960> we<00:05:29.080> go<00:05:29.259> too<00:05:29.320> deep<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.550> way

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
three four then we go too deep the way

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.379 
three four then we go too deep the way
of<00:05:31.030> thing<00:05:31.240> is<00:05:31.419> exactly<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:32.110> same<00:05:32.349> just<00:05:33.389> here

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
of thing is exactly the same just here

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.010 
of thing is exactly the same just here
we<00:05:34.509> have<00:05:34.740> a.d.d<00:05:35.740> right<00:05:36.729> hand<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.449> F<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:39.330> E<00:05:40.330> so

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
we have a.d.d right hand is F a and E so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.950 
we have a.d.d right hand is F a and E so
again<00:05:41.380> we<00:05:41.530> start<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.759> base<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.479> right<00:05:43.630> fat

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
again we start to the base the right fat

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.129 
again we start to the base the right fat
one<00:05:44.289> keep<00:05:45.130> moving<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.639> right<00:05:45.729> hand<00:05:46.270> down<00:05:46.330> 1<00:05:46.690> 2

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
one keep moving the right hand down 1 2

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.749 
one keep moving the right hand down 1 2
3<00:05:47.710> 4<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.880> press<00:05:49.090> this<00:05:50.050> d<00:05:50.380> well<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.190> rifle<00:05:51.580> is<00:05:51.729> a

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
3 4 and press this d well the rifle is a

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:58.150 
3 4 and press this d well the rifle is a
one<00:05:52.300> two<00:05:52.870> three<00:05:53.530> four<00:05:54.330> so<00:05:55.330> f<00:05:55.599> major

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.740 

d<00:05:58.730> minor<00:05:59.710> then<00:06:00.710> we<00:06:00.800> go<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.040> a<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:02.240> it's<00:06:02.630> the

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
d minor then we go to a and it's the

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.270 
d minor then we go to a and it's the
same<00:06:02.990> plane<00:06:03.830> like<00:06:04.100> before<00:06:05.020> we<00:06:06.020> stay<00:06:06.320> in<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.860> like

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
same plane like before we stay in a like

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:17.270 
same plane like before we stay in a like
1<00:06:07.610> 2<00:06:08.150> 3<00:06:08.510> 4<00:06:09.220> 1<00:06:10.220> 2<00:06:10.250> 3<00:06:10.610> 4<00:06:11.650> 12

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.460 

and<00:06:18.280> then<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.640> second<00:06:19.030> time<00:06:19.060> we<00:06:19.990> don't<00:06:20.260> have<00:06:20.440> a

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
and then the second time we don't have a

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:30.620 
and then the second time we don't have a
week<00:06:20.950> but<00:06:21.160> you<00:06:21.310> use<00:06:21.640> g2<00:06:22.570> Smith<00:06:23.970> is<00:06:24.970> d.a

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.500 

so<00:06:31.630> after<00:06:32.050> that<00:06:32.440> is<00:06:32.680> f<00:06:33.810> is<00:06:34.810> D<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:35.730> then<00:06:36.730> is<00:06:37.120> G

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
so after that is f is D and then is G

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.860 
so after that is f is D and then is G
and<00:06:37.780> is<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.380> final<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.490> last<00:06:39.700> chord<00:06:40.060> we<00:06:40.630> use

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
and is the final the last chord we use

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.140 
and is the final the last chord we use
for<00:06:41.230> the<00:06:41.410> worse

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.420 

so<00:06:46.150> this<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.539> G<00:06:46.930> base<00:06:47.650> is<00:06:47.919> G<00:06:48.689> redfin<00:06:49.689> is<00:06:49.900> G<00:06:50.289> B<00:06:51.099> and

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
so this is G base is G redfin is G B and

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.230 
so this is G base is G redfin is G B and
D<00:06:51.879> 1<00:06:52.869> 2<00:06:53.110> 3<00:06:53.139> 4<00:06:53.379> again<00:06:53.949> the<00:06:54.189> base<00:06:54.430> and<00:06:54.729> right<00:06:54.969> found
