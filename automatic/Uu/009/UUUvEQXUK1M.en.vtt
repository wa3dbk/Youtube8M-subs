00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello sometimes can happen 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.799
 the destruction of the gasket which stands between 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.440
 cylinder block and cylinder head 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.360
 cylinders are more commonly used such a term 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 punched head gasket 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 Cylinders looking where punched 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.359
 gasket 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.480
 there will be different signs of either oil or 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 gas and maybe even some 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.609
 You need to look at all the options if you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 We noticed that somewhere disappears and antifreeze 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 visible signs of flow antifreeze no then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.520
 there is a chance that you have broken 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 laying first we look 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.770
 the level and condition of the oil in the pan if 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 oil exceeds level or did you notice 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 light emulsion on the probe on the plugs 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 the filler cap of the valves then 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 you can already think about the probability 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.020
 strip destruction as one of the reasons 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 of this phenomenon but note that small 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.170
 the presence if on the lid is normal 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.670
 phenomenon due to capacitor for example 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.890
 the next sign is looking at the muffler 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 observe sniffing for knocking out 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 antifreeze from the muffler 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 but look don't mix it up with condensate 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 when the car is long standing and working on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.860
 idle speed 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 then impressiveness accumulates condensate 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 and when we press foot to dawn 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.700
 then much water flows out of it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.020
 it can be perfect not antifreeze 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.020
 ordinary condensate 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 here it is this cadenza 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 should be the next sign it should 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.170
 be such a white steam from the muffler 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 but it will be noticeable in summer, but in winter 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.400
 it will be problematic to notice 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.040
 because even we are healthy car 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 white steam goes but unless of course already 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.930
 first stage then you will notice because 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.260
 there will be too many steam and it will be 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.110
 immediately suspiciously take take off 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.830
 expansion tank cap and sniff 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.720
 antifreeze if antifreeze smacks of gasoline then 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.479
 quite possibly a gasket already somewhere 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.970
 admits but if the smell is so implicit 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.209
 then you can put the package on the neck and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.600
 about ten minutes let the car work 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.500
 here and there must be a couple and then 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.420
 it will be easier to smell this volume with pairs 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.900
 determine whether there is gasoline or not in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.770
 smells 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.160
 if there is then you understand 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.220
 the situation is unpleasant in later 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.150
 stages can already go such 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 yellow brown expansion foam 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.660
 cistern 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.580
 first a little bit more then before 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.890
 it will still notice some 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.730
 for oil me antifreeze is like on the most 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.380
 initial stage 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.310
 but that unless Maslov went with antifreeze 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.410
 original signs we can still 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.810
 go and you calmly give a couple hundred 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.530
 kilometers can and more to the house or to 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.540
 repair location when the gasket is punched 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.860
 already specifically then there is only blind 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.320
 won't notice this cant 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.380
 the oil in the pan may be even two 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.060
 antifreeze level disappears quickly of course 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.579
 hitting antifreeze in the pan can be 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.640
 because of a crack in the block itself but for now 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.760
 this topic is not discussed exhaust fumes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.880
 may exit expansion tank 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.130
 radiator like from the exhaust pipe strongly 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840
 directly on the previous ones are not 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.480
 small bubbles will appear at the beginning 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.640
 then more will be bubbling here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.250
 no longer need a bag to collect 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.590
 gas to smell this gas in 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.829
 expansion tank a and himself and exhaust 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.350
 the pipes will blow white smoke I watched 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.849
 by the way such a 412 Muscovite and when 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.430
 sun scream from the muffler 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.560
 when you press the gas pedal was punched 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.840
 laying and still a big waterfall on 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.010
 blue gave out of the muffler only no water 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.020
 antifreeze knot a 130 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.640
 so I can safely say here 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.370
 already and the child will understand that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.420
 do not confuse gaskets 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.069
 exactly my goal in this video 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.330
 was tell how to determine 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.370
 gasket failure 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 exactly at the initial first stage 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.640
 so that this problem does not reach far from 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.570
 I will remind the house once again the signs of the smell of gas 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.010
 gasoline antifreeze or oiling antifreeze 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.609
 suspiciously many white-yellow emulsions 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.250
 on the lid 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 or oil dipstick elevated level 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.810
 oil in the pan and you do not add it 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.930
 or suspiciously a lot of white steam from 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.410
 the silencer goes but it is summer in winter is not 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.690
 define we have already decided yes forgot 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.430
 say what else happens rarely but happens 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.740
 gas breakout out right through 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.169
 block laying but you too immediately 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.740
 see when you open the hood and more 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.210
 There is a burnout between the cylinders 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.070
 Well, in general, how to determine the burnout 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.380
 gaskets between the cylinders I don't know 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.660
 honestly can someone tell me 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.510
 comments write it will be all 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.110
 interesting and useful on this all up 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.890
 dating 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.890
 I wish you all good luck
