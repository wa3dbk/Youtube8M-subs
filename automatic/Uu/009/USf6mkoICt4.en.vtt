00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.270 

luckily<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.259> got<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.409> block<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.830> tackle<00:01:10.009> on

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
luckily we got a block and tackle on

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.149 
luckily we got a block and tackle on
their<00:01:10.310> makes<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.909> go<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.030> little<00:01:11.210> slower<00:01:12.159> let's

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159

go in block and tackle was a cool
invention<00:01:18.200> David<00:01:18.860> learned<00:01:19.040> something<00:01:19.399> with

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
invention David learned something with

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:34.480 
invention David learned something with
that<00:01:20.500> hmm<00:01:23.830> pop<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.070> goes

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.840 

there's<00:01:35.490> also<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.790> drawbridge<00:01:36.330> over<00:01:36.780> here

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
there's also a drawbridge over here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
there's also a drawbridge over here
currently<00:01:38.850> happens<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.870> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
currently happens to be down but the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
currently happens to be down but the
vehicle<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.070> also<00:01:41.220> pull<00:01:41.580> up<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
vehicle there can also pull up the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.590 
vehicle there can also pull up the
drawbridge<00:01:43.340> very<00:01:44.340> cool<00:01:44.760> what<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:45.540> think

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
drawbridge very cool what do you think

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:57.620 
drawbridge very cool what do you think
David<00:01:46.140> oh<00:01:54.080> he<00:01:55.080> let<00:01:55.260> go<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:56.000> another<00:01:57.000> crash<00:01:57.330> and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
what's next vehicle number three moving

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.830 
what's next vehicle number three moving
into<00:02:23.580> action<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> other<00:02:28.440> controller

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
into action have the other controller

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:42.170 
into action have the other controller
change<00:02:30.840> channels<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:59.710 

like<00:02:43.180> channel<00:02:43.569> 6

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.930 

bridge<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:00.930> drawbridge<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.010> down<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
bridge is up drawbridge is down can you

bridge is up drawbridge is down can you
make<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.330> other<00:03:03.450> ones<00:03:03.600> go<00:03:03.750> over<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
make one of the other ones go over the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:15.880 
make one of the other ones go over the
drawbridge

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.450 

okay<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.840> pretty<00:03:17.990> cool<00:03:18.140> home<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.370> it

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
okay this is pretty cool home here it

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.880 
okay this is pretty cool home here it
comes<00:03:19.670> drawbridge<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.630> down<00:03:26.470> kind<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.500> vehicle

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
comes drawbridge is down kind of vehicle

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:36.610 
comes drawbridge is down kind of vehicle
number<00:03:27.980> two<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.870> good<00:03:36.080> when<00:03:36.260> we<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.470> both<00:03:36.590> use

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
number two is good when we can both use

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.949 
number two is good when we can both use
teamwork<00:03:37.130> we<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:37.850> sort<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.120> both<00:03:38.270> use<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.870> at

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
teamwork we can sort of both use it at

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.900 
teamwork we can sort of both use it at
the<00:03:39.050> same<00:03:39.230> time<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:39.860> can<00:03:40.070> David<00:03:40.670> can<00:03:40.790> lower

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the same time and I can David can lower

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 
the same time and I can David can lower
the<00:03:41.090> drawbridge<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:41.870> can<00:03:42.050> drive<00:03:42.230> over<00:03:42.290> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the drawbridge and I can drive over it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.180 
the drawbridge and I can drive over it
and<00:03:42.860> then<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:45.230> can<00:03:45.380> each<00:03:45.500> latch<00:03:45.739> on<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:45.980> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
and then you can each latch on to the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.590 
and then you can each latch on to the
different<00:03:46.489> things<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:47.239> really<00:03:47.510> cool<00:03:47.750> that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
David made it look over the drawbridge

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.890 
David made it look over the drawbridge
turns<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.890> corner<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.610> whoop<00:04:01.970> whoa<00:04:02.600> no<00:04:03.820> he<00:04:04.900> this
