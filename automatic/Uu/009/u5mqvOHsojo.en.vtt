00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 at the first game I want to go first 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.400
 show again from the mouth of fermi 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.389
 you create a moon mini so what 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.929
 now the first part 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.550
 Of course there are several things that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.140
 So now 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.930
 simply times the tour had again 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.550
 just brought one out but that was 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.500
 apparently not so understandable 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.250
 so come up here right now 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.770
 already in 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.080
 that's what I opened the top door 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.869
 opens at the top you can a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.780
 Write for example, you write 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.000
 extreme so my ps3 names around 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.640
 two draftsman my own now 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.200
 So for example version 2 jo 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.410
 and then there's that, that's just the one 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.609
 first part and yes it's all under there 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.500
 over as up menu 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.059
 For example, write as once 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.350
 first want that means I want now 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.510
 on this war line so the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.760
 most important things of course the menu 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.579
 opens directly that would be the first 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.160
 part of July and the place so 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 or rather I have 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 always happy 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.180
 patrick so I can scotch directly 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.160
 you get that a mistake 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 I can stop then scotch directly 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.180
 and always jump up 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.190
 for example curry or something like that 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.130
 I in fact menu let me too 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.870
 always very important so because most 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.090
 want to see people and always annoying 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.370
 because of the listening and award and everything 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 possible and I do not do it either 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.960
 everything but me because somehow 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.940
 that would have been stupid now I show there 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.290
 several parts and search now write 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.730
 I nominate him 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.460
 that means speed gravity slomo already the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.480
 whole things because I just meant 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.040
 that would be the first part and now 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.410
 then still of mines 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.770
 you are quite normal that all 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.360
 err and fulda marshal so here 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
 no harm will you come up and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.560
 all the possible things because that would have to 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.350
 I restrict everything under it too 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.660
 that which is below is the first one 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.160
 tower and you see that and if you 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.830
 then clicks on it comes to you 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.000
 example quick menu and then if 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.800
 her it comes to the next infection 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 Last of the style I can advise you that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.200
 first time as far as I irritated now 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.780
 have tested and then test that 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.430
 You know where to write something 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.920
 if we understood the whole menu would have to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 not because it is structured differently 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.620
 that now builds up like the theater 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.160
 comics and john coates so me 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 just down synonymous just a copy 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.530
 Exactly I copy that some things first 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.530
 goes faster 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.480
 So that's what I'm doing now 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.900
 it just does not take me any longer 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.820
 long 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.390
 then, of course, then write that then 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.010
 that if it so this everything now 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.700
 have written the whole lot 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.440
 open 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.510
 if you like it, for example, quick 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.600
 menu is where I come now to bin 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.410
 So the quick menu is the first to write 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.470
 would uww for me so always yourself 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.230
 I always like to go next 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.550
 for example or extra she wanted 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.360
 actually most like explosive bull 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.320
 most users then of course have 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.110
 I just leave the earth behind 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.850
 had done 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.750
 Yes , I have that from now on 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.770
 the beginning is to show you 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:37.220
 and yes, that's what we'll do 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.780
 clicks then comes here then comes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.520
 next, if you never on infection 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.610
 on top of that, of course, comes completely from above 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.690
 big infection mini stand that you 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.600
 keep on knowing 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.400
 and then I have as most of them 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.910
 people want their july and 1 assist 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.020
 and therefore quite annoying from 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.490
 That's why I always have it first 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 infection I do not really have it now 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.150
 a lot filled so I have only that 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.820
 reingetan that they now simply the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.920
 can ever have and look at you Conclusion 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.020
 switzerland also all must have yes yes 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.590
 then the next very easy 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.240
 including rein again always writes 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.540
 important that it just goes faster 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:24.660
 I'm not going to do it now because 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.140
 Me that annoys then you come to a lobby 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.140
 mini 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.110
 I stop there then always have it 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.789
 super speed and criticism on slow the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.800
 Whole things though I like too 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.350
 always pension what degree already said 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.850
 meet the menu of the marshall like that 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.440
 that the tasks for the people with the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.710
 you are in the lobby and no 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.810
 For example, commando is easy 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.229
 before that they can get it no 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.970
 hurt if you do that yes 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.509
 actual home so with you through 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.160
 work to the end and that lasts and 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.680
 already agree on a bit again 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.560
 as always and then she opens up 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.370
 that function is there that is added 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.260
 a short 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.479
 how good are the best of others 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.520
 and menus i have for example here 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.430
 war mini I have my first year 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.350
 expected emas is the code 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.900
 For that you just catch up 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.940
 I just go out of one and the other 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.889
 the video does not look at her 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.330
 do you have enough minis others opens up 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.130
 just a patch for short at those 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.710
 shortly after there it is 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.020
 I just managed to run well because 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.130
 right now no one had copied them 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.919
 simply from the other million 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.500
 writes it in there and just as with the 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.139
 other good as speed good there's yes 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.669
 just in short there are the short 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.699
 Can you kill yourself from another murder? 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.130
 just copy and paste 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.409
 yes, and then that works pretty well 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.479
 that now in and the first part so 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.880
 I 'll keep watching 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.440
 maybe here today, too 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.889
 still several things that not only the 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.220
 Beginning 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:05.470
 it takes so long he comes that much 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.419
 is actually what I need now 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.159
 You do not really need more 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.159
 does not need them and then you will
