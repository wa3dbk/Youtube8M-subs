00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
point I would always say bring up the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.959

intensity of your workouts because
here's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> thing<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.039> with

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
here's the thing it's what you do with

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.420 
here's the thing it's what you do with
your<00:00:53.430> time<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.059> counts<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
your time that counts if you're just you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.639 
your time that counts if you're just you
know<00:00:56.520> using<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.809> wisely<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
know using your time not so wisely and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
know using your time not so wisely and
you're<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.980> moping<00:00:59.430> about<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.270> gym<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you're just moping about the gym and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
you're just moping about the gym and
you're<00:01:01.500> taking<00:01:01.859> two<00:01:02.190> longer<00:01:02.640> rest<00:01:02.879> periods

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you're taking two longer rest periods

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
you're taking two longer rest periods
then<00:01:03.690> chances<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:05.010> metabolism<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
then chances are your metabolism is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
then chances are your metabolism is
going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> really<00:01:06.510> change<00:01:06.840> too<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.580> now

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
going to really change too much now

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
going to really change too much now
intervals<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.750> work<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.229> well<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.830> boost

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
intervals can work really well to boost

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.690 
intervals can work really well to boost
up<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.580> metabolism<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> um<00:01:13.439> intervals<00:01:14.159> with

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
up your metabolism so um intervals with

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
up your metabolism so um intervals with
minimum<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.140> minimal<00:01:16.650> rest<00:01:17.130> periods

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
minimum with with minimal rest periods

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
minimum with with minimal rest periods
so<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> minimize<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.479> rest<00:01:18.720> periods<00:01:19.259> it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so to minimize your rest periods it's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.140 
so to minimize your rest periods it's
also<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> work<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.790> body<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.090> little

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
also going to work your body a little

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.700 
also going to work your body a little
bit<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.950> highly<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.430> intensity<00:01:24.090> or

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
bit more highly and more intensity or

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.010 
bit more highly and more intensity or
obviously<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:25.860> body<00:01:26.100> needs<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> recover

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
obviously your body needs to recover

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.280 
obviously your body needs to recover
between<00:01:28.020> each<00:01:28.290> rest<00:01:29.009> exercise<00:01:29.840> between<00:01:30.840> rest

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
between each rest exercise between rest

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.749 
between each rest exercise between rest
on<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> exercises<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> minimize

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
on the exercises but if you minimize

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
on the exercises but if you minimize
your<00:01:33.150> rest<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> let<00:01:34.619> your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
your rest you're gonna have to let your

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
your rest you're gonna have to let your
body<00:01:35.009> work<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.640> harder<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.119> that's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
body work a little bit harder so that's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
body work a little bit harder so that's
a<00:01:36.360> good<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.630> strategy<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> work<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.799> if

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
a good little strategy to work on if

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.380 
a good little strategy to work on if
you're<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.520> fit<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> start<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.240> might

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you're not so fit the start it might

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
you're not so fit the start it might
take<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.900> while<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> point

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
take a little while to get to that point

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
take a little while to get to that point
i<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.970> also<00:01:42.329> interchange<00:01:43.110> cardio<00:01:43.860> with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
i would also interchange cardio with

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.480 
i would also interchange cardio with
calisthenics<00:01:45.259> exercises<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.740> basically<00:01:47.130> do

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
calisthenics exercises so basically do

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.819 
calisthenics exercises so basically do
for<00:01:47.850> example<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.290> could<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.649> some

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
for example you can you could do some

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
for example you can you could do some
push-ups<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.909> straight<00:01:51.240> after<00:01:51.659> your

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
push-ups and then straight after your

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I think the key is just a trunk check

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480 
I think the key is just a trunk check
out<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.600> junk<00:02:40.320> food<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.040> not<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
your protein levels because what this

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.710 
your protein levels because what this
does<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.410> keeps<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.700> full<00:02:54.060> for

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
longer and also it takes longer for the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
longer and also it takes longer for the
protein<00:02:59.040> sources<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.730> break<00:02:59.970> down<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.540> your

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
