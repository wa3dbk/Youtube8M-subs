slide 2 G in the third fifth first 13

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700 
slide 2 G in the third fifth first 13
then<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.630> do<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> quick<00:03:35.990> transition<00:03:36.500> between

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:13.120 
and I'm the first so I haven't practiced
so<00:06:57.510> much<00:06:57.570> this<00:06:57.900> part<00:06:58.230> I<00:06:58.470> but<00:06:59.250> I<00:06:59.280> think

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.600 

got<00:07:14.130> I<00:07:14.930> think<00:07:15.930> it<00:07:16.110> sounds<00:07:16.500> good<00:07:16.650> it's<00:07:16.830> not<00:07:17.190> like

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
got I think it sounds good it's not like

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.610 
got I think it sounds good it's not like
the<00:07:17.850> original<00:07:18.300> but<00:07:18.540> i<00:07:18.570> think<00:07:18.900> it's<00:07:19.020> an<00:07:19.169> easier

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
the original but i think it's an easier

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.100 
the original but i think it's an easier
way<00:07:19.800> to<00:07:19.830> play<00:07:20.190> and<00:07:20.490> it<00:07:20.669> sounds<00:07:21.060> good<00:07:21.270> and<00:07:21.480> then

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
way to play and it sounds good and then

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.830 
way to play and it sounds good and then
in<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.889> final<00:07:23.190> part<00:07:26.000> this<00:07:27.000> is<00:07:27.060> the<00:07:27.300> final<00:07:27.690> part

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 
in the final part this is the final part

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.100 
in the final part this is the final part
and<00:07:28.080> then<00:07:28.200> he<00:07:28.560> moves<00:07:28.830> to
