00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.340
 Hello dez 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
 and in this video I will talk about how 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.080
 send pictures photo image with 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.179
 computer to phone from phone to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
 computer 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.450
 the very first way is the easiest 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.450
 we connect the phone via usb cable 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 computer 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.000
 go to my computer 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.510
 we see that there was a portable 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.940
 device windows phone billy phone 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.900
 open up 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:39.340
 open the background folder and go to the folder 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.110
 pictures and here we are dropping the right 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.650
 image here is an example of this 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.880
 picture 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.120
 wire 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.900
 and just dragging it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.450
 like on a regular flash drive here i'm dragging 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.810
 on the phone is also very simple 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.460
 drag from phone to computer 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.890
 under the example I want to take a screenshot 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.380
 moved the furnace from greenshot 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.409
 and chose the right image and betrayed him 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.270
 over the computer here it is very easy 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.640
 very simple earlier on windows phone 7 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.759
 it was not well , it is finally 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.229
 appeared 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.719
 at least one other phones already have this 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.780
 so long before it was okay not about 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.479
 this is the second way the second way is 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.219
 transmissions using the application but 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.219
 the application is no longer zoon 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:34.450
 although unfortunately it seemed to me more convenient than 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.610
 but this is how this application looks 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 we need to create a sync folder then 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.400
 there is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.860
 beat you my computer library 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.260
 and an image can be added here 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.660
 or change the folder that is already 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.360
 on your computer and not stored 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.070
 whale any images here for example i 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 nothing 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.910
 me in this folder is empty but i can 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.930
 throw off 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:11.570
 application from wanted another picture 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.570
 so throw it in this folder 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 go to this application this tab 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.880
 fotos and see what appeared 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 picture 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.280
 here at me 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.800
 Zhenya can not be here in this application 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.349
 view photos 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.370
 noting that there is that folder 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:41.510
 the sync that I chose assigned 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 I press sing and now this picture 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 transmitted to the phone and in the same way 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.660
 can be transferred very easily to the phone 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.660
 on the computer choose those images 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.660
 bark 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.660
 you want to throw off a few examples 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.200
 pictures and press shift and computer 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.620
 great where did these images appear 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:18.590
 they should appear in the folder that we 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.079
 have assigned image libraries and here 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.640
 the image that I throw off all she 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.920
 distributed into folders like on 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.360
 phone, the first image is such 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.530
 your mouse with vocals 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.280
 and two other images that I 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 synced from the corporate image 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.079
 issues on 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.700
 that's the way you can work with it 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.730
 by the application but in fact it is not 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.890
 more convenient zone i would say let's 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.000
 move on to the third way the third 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.849
 The way we do is transfer 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.530
 images via skydrive go to 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.500
 windows live 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.890
 vagina msya under your phone account 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.890
 go skydrive 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.090
 still 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.850
 and upload the photos in the ass 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.500
 the image you need for this 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.500
 prepared a separate picture skydrive 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.610
 sending is in progress 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.060
 and then 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.300
 You can also upload images here from 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.910
 phone but I had nothing 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.620
 downloaded from phone 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:44.160
 skydrive 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.410
 and let's move the phone so I have 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.110
 phone and can now calmly 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.479
 disconnect the usb cable from it 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:59.070
 last first thing we pass 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.650
 image as a flash drive do not let 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.360
 let's see where she survived she 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.100
 preserved photo photo albums and 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.310
 other photos 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.979
 this image is this image 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.960
 can be passed to change and delete 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:22.289
 well and so on the second image we 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.250
 transmitted using the windows application 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.710
 phone and it is saved to the folder with 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.680
 same name as on the computer here it is 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.090
 the image is exactly the same we are with this 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.300
 image can do all that 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.180
 want to send delete send 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.630
 change well and so on well and the third 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.760
 the way is the way to transfer to skydrive 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.870
 let's take the same photo now 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.070
 send on skydrive 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.370
 keep more precisely on the phone connected to 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.370
 the internet 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.150
 well and let's enter skydrive and 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.840
 look at the image that 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.660
 uploaded blue with skydrive logo for 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.349
 this we need to download the application 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.160
 skydrive 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:19.910
 I already downloaded it and where 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.910
 photo preserved 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:30.449
 Basically it is clear it has retained 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:32.520
 the photo folder here is this image i 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.849
 I can download and it will remain with me 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:42.800
 photo albums photo uploaded and 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.800
 also the picture that I sent 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.830
 From skydrive phones, here it is now you 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.300
 can open it quietly on the computer 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.490
 and see if you need it well 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.140

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.820
