Spitfire prop well the best way for me

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.649 
Spitfire prop well the best way for me
to<00:00:57.530> explain<00:00:57.979> that<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.970> actually<00:00:59.089> compare

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
to explain that is to actually compare

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.689 
to explain that is to actually compare
to<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.989> industry<00:01:00.500> standard<00:01:00.949> Black<00:01:01.400> Max

aluminum<00:01:02.269> problem<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.080> first<00:01:03.320> thing<00:01:03.500> you're

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
aluminum problem the first thing you're

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.410 
aluminum problem the first thing you're
going<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:03.830> notice<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.850> diameter<00:01:05.120> of

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
going to notice is that the diameter of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.570 
going to notice is that the diameter of
this<00:01:05.570> prop<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:05.900> smaller<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.800> prop<00:01:07.070> can<00:01:07.280> spin

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
this prop is smaller the prop can spin

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.160 
this prop is smaller the prop can spin
up<00:01:07.700> faster<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.330> give<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:08.960> good

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
up faster and give you that good

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.680 
up faster and give you that good
acceleration<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:10.130> hole<00:01:10.280> shot<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.330> second

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
acceleration and hole shot the second

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.210 
acceleration and hole shot the second
thing<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.960> look<00:01:11.990> at<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.680> actual<00:01:12.799> blade

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
thing to look at is the actual blade

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.280 
thing to look at is the actual blade
design<00:01:13.610> between<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.180> two<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.810> first<00:01:15.080> thing

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
design between the two the first thing

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.050 
design between the two the first thing
on<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.500> Spitfire<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.370> you'll<00:01:16.610> see<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.850> has<00:01:17.000> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
on the Spitfire is you'll see it has a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.850 
on the Spitfire is you'll see it has a
straight<00:01:17.510> trailing<00:01:17.900> edge<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.350> real

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
straight trailing edge and real

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.190 
straight trailing edge and real
aggressive<00:01:19.250> cupping<00:01:19.790> what<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.720> allows<00:01:20.960> this

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
aggressive cupping what that allows this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.500 
aggressive cupping what that allows this
prop<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.650> do<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:22.010> literally<00:01:22.460> grab<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.299> water

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
prop to do is literally grab the water

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.240 
prop to do is literally grab the water
so<00:01:24.020> you'll<00:01:24.170> see<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.710> whole<00:01:24.979> shot

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
so you'll see that on the whole shot

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.609 
so you'll see that on the whole shot
again<00:01:25.549> but<00:01:26.180> another<00:01:26.450> important<00:01:26.960> place<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.470> if

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
again but another important place is if

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.410 
again but another important place is if
you've<00:01:27.799> got<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.190> engine<00:01:28.580> trimmed<00:01:28.909> up<00:01:29.120> and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
you've got this engine trimmed up and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510 
you've got this engine trimmed up and
you're<00:01:29.720> making<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:30.080> fairly<00:01:30.440> sharp<00:01:30.680> turn<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
you're making a fairly sharp turn this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.340 
you're making a fairly sharp turn this
prop<00:01:31.820> will<00:01:32.030> not<00:01:32.210> blow<00:01:32.450> out<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.930> it's<00:01:33.110> going<00:01:33.260> to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
prop will not blow out and it's going to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.500 
prop will not blow out and it's going to
keep<00:01:33.530> holding<00:01:33.980> that<00:01:34.010> water<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.060> cool<00:01:35.270> thing

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
keep holding that water the cool thing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.880 
keep holding that water the cool thing
about<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.960> prop<00:01:36.260> is<00:01:36.470> you're<00:01:36.620> going<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.770> be

able to use it on a wide range of boats

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.500 
able to use it on a wide range of boats
all<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.440> way<00:01:39.530> down<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.920> 25<00:01:40.490> horse<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.180> all

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
the way up to 125 horse you'll also have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.180 
the way up to 125 horse you'll also have
three<00:01:44.510> different<00:01:44.540> sizes<00:01:45.230> for<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.740> pontoon

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
out on the water and see how it works

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.690 
out on the water and see how it works

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
out with the Black Max prop got a feel

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
out with the Black Max prop got a feel
for<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.350> boat<00:02:00.560> kind<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.100> time<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.520> whole<00:02:01.700> shot

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
for the boat kind of time the whole shot

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.180 
for the boat kind of time the whole shot
actually<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:02.750> took<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.620> through<00:02:03.800> its<00:02:03.950> paces

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
actually and took it through its paces

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
went back to shore

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.380 
went back to shore
switch<00:02:06.470> props<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.340> new<00:02:07.490> Spitfire<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
switch props to the new Spitfire and

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.749 
switch props to the new Spitfire and
when<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.929> went<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.259> we<00:02:09.619> did<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.039> same<00:02:10.369> thing

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
when we went out we did the same thing

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.000 
when we went out we did the same thing
and<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:11.360> an<00:02:11.480> amazing<00:02:11.840> difference<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
and it was an amazing difference the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.860 
and it was an amazing difference the
whole<00:02:13.220> shot<00:02:13.519> was<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> lot<00:02:13.970> faster<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.540> fact<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
whole shot was a lot faster in fact a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.600 
whole shot was a lot faster in fact a
couple<00:02:15.170> seconds<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.709> what<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:15.950> shaved<00:02:16.220> off<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
couple seconds is what we shaved off the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.970 
couple seconds is what we shaved off the
time<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.599> acceleration<00:02:17.870> through<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.800> whole

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
time the acceleration through the whole

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.550 
time the acceleration through the whole
shot<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.610> markedly<00:02:20.390> different<00:02:20.659> all<00:02:21.050> three<00:02:21.440> of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
shot was markedly different all three of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770 
shot was markedly different all three of
us<00:02:21.709> agreed<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.819> was<00:02:22.940> much<00:02:23.150> faster<00:02:23.690> and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
us agreed that it was much faster and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.839 
us agreed that it was much faster and
much<00:02:23.900> more<00:02:23.959> acceleration<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.489> we<00:02:25.610> put

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
much more acceleration then we put

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.030 
much more acceleration then we put
through<00:02:26.269> some<00:02:26.450> real<00:02:26.659> sharp<00:02:26.959> turns<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
through some real sharp turns and the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.040 
through some real sharp turns and the
holding<00:02:28.489> ability<00:02:28.909> of<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.090> prop<00:02:29.420> was<00:02:29.690> nothing

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
holding ability of this prop was nothing

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.050 
holding ability of this prop was nothing
short<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.440> amazing

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
short of amazing

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.260 
short of amazing
so<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:32.020> combine<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.440> those<00:02:32.950> factors<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.910> you
