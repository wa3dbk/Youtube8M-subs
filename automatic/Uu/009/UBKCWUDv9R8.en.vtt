first point of the valley the seven
shrine<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.379> sit<00:00:55.590> commander<00:00:55.949> tapes<00:00:56.280> run<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
shrine to sit commander tapes run you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.130 
shrine to sit commander tapes run you
have<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.500> learn<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.800> maximize<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.820> space

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
have to learn how to maximize your space

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
have to learn how to maximize your space
now<00:01:02.329> I'm<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.539> fast<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> make

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
now I'm not fast for this just to make

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.109 
now I'm not fast for this just to make
this<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.760> faster<00:01:06.540> honestly<00:01:07.939> this<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this bit faster honestly this is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.630 
this bit faster honestly this is
actually<00:01:09.510> easier<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.619> remove<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
actually easier if you remove your

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.410 
actually easier if you remove your
castle<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.920> watch<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> 8th<00:01:14.760> shrine

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
castle and if you watch the 8th shrine

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
castle and if you watch the 8th shrine
video<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:17.100> better<00:01:17.340> layout

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
video it has a much better layout

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
video it has a much better layout
this<00:01:18.450> version<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.140> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.040> good

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
this version is kind of not like good

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
this version is kind of not like good
just<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.150> walking<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.770> but

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
just because I was walking around but

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.359 
just because I was walking around but
quite<00:01:23.040> easy<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> shrine<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.630> even

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
quite easy if it's in a shrine and even

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
quite easy if it's in a shrine and even
easier<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.880> actually<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.950> crazy

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
easier if you actually want to be crazy

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.219 
easier if you actually want to be crazy
and<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.729> fit<00:01:29.939> around<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.390> him<00:01:30.570> they

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and actually fit around to him they

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
and actually fit around to him they
don't<00:01:31.380> meet<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.860> need<00:01:32.159> eight<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> last

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
don't meet you need eight in the last

don't meet you need eight in the last

this is again the the not the most
economical<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.770> doing<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> can

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
economical way of doing this but it can

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.360 
economical way of doing this but it can
place<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> mission<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> matters

can actually fit five shrines on the
right<00:02:04.450> side<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.080> therefore<00:02:05.530> only<00:02:05.980> need<00:02:06.160> three

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
right side and therefore only need three

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.550 
right side and therefore only need three
on<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.790> left<00:02:07.030> anyway<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.170> pretty<00:02:08.380> easy

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
on the left anyway that was pretty easy

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.040 
on the left anyway that was pretty easy
had<00:02:09.369> some<00:02:09.640> looked<00:02:09.880> at<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.180> to<00:02:10.360> run<00:02:10.810> one

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
had some looked at the a to run one

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.930 
had some looked at the a to run one
which<00:02:11.290> may<00:02:11.620> kind<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.040> put<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.310> off<00:02:12.520> but<00:02:12.820> it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
which may kind of put you off but it

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.910 
which may kind of put you off but it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
actually is really easy this is my

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.700

ignore the resource points like the
spring<00:02:33.250> trees<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.960> use<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.290> layout

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
spring trees just just use this layout

and<00:02:35.950> all<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.910> have<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.240> do<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.690> get<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.170> trans

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and all you have to do is get a trans

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.580 
and all you have to do is get a trans
running<00:02:39.570> okay<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.750> might<00:02:40.900> seem<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.380> bit<00:02:41.560> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
running okay it might seem like a bit of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.449 
running okay it might seem like a bit of
a<00:02:41.740> fit<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.580> quite<00:02:42.820> easy<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.310> be

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
a fit but it's quite easy I think to be

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.980 
a fit but it's quite easy I think to be
the<00:02:48.490> creative<00:02:48.940> thinking<00:02:49.300> they're<00:02:49.510> gonna

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
the creative thinking they're gonna

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.100 
the creative thinking they're gonna
fight<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> five<00:02:50.770> shrines<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:52.480> area<00:02:52.690> so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
fight the five shrines in one area so

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.720 
fight the five shrines in one area so
now<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.709> looking<00:02:53.830> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.070> left<00:02:54.130> side

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
now I'm looking on the left side

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
now I'm looking on the left side
remember<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.270> build<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.900> -<00:02:56.020> by<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
remember to build just right - by the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.070 
remember to build just right - by the
way<00:02:56.410> they<00:02:56.709> don't<00:02:56.830> get<00:02:57.010> provide<00:02:57.340> for<00:02:57.610> you

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
way they don't get provide for you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.550 
way they don't get provide for you
another<00:02:59.080> thing<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.380> consider<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
another thing to consider is the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.130 
another thing to consider is the
optional<00:03:02.560> challenge<00:03:02.950> version<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.330> have<00:03:04.989> to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
optional challenge version you have to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.040 
optional challenge version you have to
use<00:03:05.350> less<00:03:05.709> than<00:03:05.739> 15<00:03:06.340> buildings<00:03:06.820> if<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.660> don't

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
use less than 15 buildings if you don't

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.020 
use less than 15 buildings if you don't
go<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.500> extra<00:03:08.860> buildings<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.820> same

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
go in extra buildings it's the same

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300 
go in extra buildings it's the same
thing
