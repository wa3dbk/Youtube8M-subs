00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.620
 explained in this video a treatment of 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.869
 medicinal plants very effective for 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 treat right syndrome 1a when 

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:11.700
 it comes from dysfunction of the uterus 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.180
 will explain you in other videos of the 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.520
 Thematic about pyramidal syndrome 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 as a possibility when the sign of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.940
 purpose is given right the one that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 is produced by the alteration of the uterus 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.980
 the uterus causes a blockage in the fifth 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 green lumbar and hang Quinteros 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 the lumbar will cause a detection of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.930
 a nerve root that if that root 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.880
 nervous is what will cause the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 involuntary reflex contracture of this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 pyramidal muscle with the peculiarity of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 that in the thickness of this muscle passes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 the sciatic nerve blue line that we have 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 here and that nerve can be seen 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.100
 strangulated tablet and can give 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 pains reflexes towards the leg a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 pain that usually does not exceed the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.220
 knee a pain that is increased to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 sitting in the car for example well 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.720
 but how does it affect how that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.850
 uterus how is that line of union 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.519
 between the uterus and the gene on Christmas 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.340
 uterus causes stiffness throughout the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.900
 lower back 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.870
 specifically will place and facilitate the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
 blockage of the fifth lumbar vertebra 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.500
 this nerve irritation will take away 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 will insert lumbar will facilitate that occurs 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
 this pyramid spasm this is the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.970
 process that will be from an entity the uterus and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.250
 the xi 9 pyramidal agreement but which 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.440
 is the most effective treatment a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 food treatment that I propose 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.130
 in other videos it's important but the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 Plant treatment is essential 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.180
 what treatment do you lower the uterus well 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 first of all if the rules are 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 irregular and painful and we suspect 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.910
 that this is the problem that may be 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.050
 altering the pyramidal ideal back 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.900
 It will be this time that of plants 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.460

 except the first charge way half 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
 of weight that the rest all equal 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.660
 weight except the first half of that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 mixture of herbs you will take a spoonful 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.490
 tureen and with a glass that has served 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.229
 previously it has broken to boil the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.420
 remove if you throw a spoonful of this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.369
 mix for each glass is that repeat this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.040
 three times 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.930
 that is three infusions a day 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.459
 I repeat a tablespoon of that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.400
 mixture of herbs for each infusion 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.799

 the liquid is left from the bed 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.269
 mineral that is 1 element is left 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.940
 impregnating the saliva for a few seconds 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.760
 half a minute and it is swallowed and it will also be 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.409
