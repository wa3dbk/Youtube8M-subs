 my parents as a child instilled in me 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.860
 that love for gasoline and I think that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.400
 since I was little I first learned to drive 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.380

 many times with friends or being is 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.080
 stay in the house on the leg but 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 that is the lifestyle that one chooses 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.210
 and is the one that I like 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.790

 intensive a little more than a month and a half 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.890
 after the recovery I retired the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.500
 sport for a little over two years 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.380

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.740
 production is fine with me can 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 return 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.690
 the love for the notes takes it my 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.450

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.710
 at that time they did not have 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.120
 none of the resources there yale 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.760
 anecdotes that I have shared 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.370
 the time that I'm running speed 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.870
 for us 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.360
 It was very difficult because we 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.980
 It was important to travel in them at 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.740
 same motorcycles from one city to another 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.960
 to be able to compete, that's why I share 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.550
 much of him we are very on top of 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.440

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.250
 well done to get the opportunity 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.250
 now it gives life 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.460
 is the biggest support I have in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.090
 Sport is the same as my whole family 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.340
 but my father for being is impellers that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.970
 he got me in this sport is a 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.120
 person who 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.650
 who advised me more than as a scolding 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.260
 common 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 as a wake-up call is so that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.769
 improve 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.930

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 Santiago is a bit complex and those are 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.090
 many feelings found one 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.790
 because sport as a motor as 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.730
 motorcyclist 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.189
 and I have lived it in my own flesh and other 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.620
 thing is one as a father say is going to 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.659
 can go on my son but they are very 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.109
 beautiful that we live in our sport 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.310
 since my whole family supports him and what 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.310
 we live to the full 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.599
 the game I see my father because the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.950
 estopa estopa can from very small or 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.299
 someone who was a very person 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.849
 charlatan that at the moment I do not remember 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.430
 the name that started telling me this 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.689
 so they left me and they left me 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.689
 this whistles for being the son
