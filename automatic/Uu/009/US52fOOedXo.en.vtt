 for colds to request help 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.009
 status that is given to a child in a 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.290
 situation of this type is of greater 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.610
 urgency I understood then by 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.280

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.539
 explain and then that's where it 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.210
 could a process of 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.610
 support knocked on the door of this headquarters and 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.920
 one of them entered but when the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.630

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 here they do not give they are not giving the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 asylum for other countries and what 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 that all they can do I can 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 to do is talk to the government here 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.719
 to give them security 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.149
 but what they are going to do is 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.549
 give you some week and then what 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.979
 they will leave the same and the problem is not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.819
