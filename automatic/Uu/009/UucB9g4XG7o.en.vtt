 the magazine 'foreign policy' has published 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 a list with the five innovations 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.210
 2012 techniques that with more potential for 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.370
 become powerful weapons in a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 future next a firearm 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 manufactured by means of a 3d printer 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.000
 is the first candidate to become 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.730
 in object of intimidation in the future 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.850
 next nobody knows the scope that will have 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 in 5 or 10 years this technology or 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 the role he will play in conflicts 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.539
 worldwide and someone can print a

 assault rifle weapons enthusiasts 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.170
 They have already created a website 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 instructions for making weapons through 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.760
 of 3d printers drones boats other 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 invention is a missile ship 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 controlled remotely by the Navy of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.950
 us and that is formally known as 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 unmanned module you in this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 moment the system consists of a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.520
 36-foot fast speed boat 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.140
 nightly and infrared cameras and

 currently several western countries 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 aspire to develop a new 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.290
 generation of stealth aircraft 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.899

 to eliminate 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.450
 those threats the robots can 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 react to unscheduled events
