00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello how about here I show you a design 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.839
 new where will I use this organic 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.490
 What is a roll to the network I already have a list 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.710
 of the almond and now I'm just going to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.390
 and delineate the area of ​​the smile with 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.269
 this critic 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.919
 it's like to highlight a little more 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.919
 the almond 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.400
 it's so simple 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.640
 and between one side the other to fill them 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.880
 get to the tension anchors then 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.440
 Now I'm going to put this acrylic that 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.690
 it just showed that it's seeing and sad 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.930
 of the collection 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.680
 What did I do 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.130
 I really like this acrylic 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.300
 why 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.500
 has colors between purple rose has 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.360
 silver flowers and blue sparkles and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.610
 shines brightly for all 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.270
 the decoration elements that have 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.270
 this mix 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.030
 then now I'm going to put this acrylic 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.569
 which is the cns of the african collection of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.329
 organic this technician has the angel 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:26.900
 silver very shiny also and nothing more 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'm going to put it in the area of 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.980
 from the tip 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.980
 so very simple at the tip 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 then now I'm going to encapsulate the nail and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.610
 I 'm going to give you I 'm going to press with the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.760
 main to maya equal for 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.050
 so to mark the curves and to give 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.170
 more strength in the nail 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.430
 so now what I'm going to do here 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.680
 with this piece of paper that I am 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.230
 showing this is the paper where 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.170
 we have the forms for 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.450
 sculpture 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.170
 and here it is very easy to make flowers 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.930
 also when they want to make flowers like 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.100
 of fifth and eighth dimensions then here 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.330
 is where they are made and 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.330
 it takes off very easily 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 very good to work the dimension 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.510
 so he 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 how can they be the high of the high 3 but 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.190
 Now what I'm going to do is going to be a 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.130
 butterfly 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.870
 and I showed you the organics I'm going to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.069
 use 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.420
 Lilita is the plan of the new colors 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.840
 and I'm going to use the organic black color 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.700
 there I put a pearl a little bigger the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.690
 first that I put 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.610
 to make the wing of a butterfly and 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.050
 down here I'm doing another but this 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.380
 it's a little bit smaller 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.830
 and very simple very angry I open halo and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.010
 I shape the sides with him 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.320
 with the brush this brush that I am 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.320
 using is number 5 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 and the truth is I found myself to work 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.010
 with him very well 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.849
 also the one that I like for the third 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.849
 dimension is the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.730
 they say organic sculptor that is the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.680
 number 4 or the master gel that is the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.319
 number 6 can also be served 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.569
 for the third dimension in fact it was 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.480
 the one that is always accepted is a 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.890
 dimension because with the brush number 4 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.830
 and now I really could not because 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.709
 I do not know, I could not work with him 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.330
 then with the flowers with the brush 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.600
 that I could make the flowers was with the 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.110
 master gel so if you have a 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.270
 little difficulty to make the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.420
 third dimension because I recommend them 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.319
 get that brush and master gel that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.980
 It's the number 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.629
 I think it's a cherry that is from 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:17.620
 organic and with that they will be able to learn 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.919
 do the third dimension then here 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.320
 I already made the body of the butterfly with 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.250
 organic smell black and nothing else I'm 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.340
 filling the wings with a little 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.110
 of shampoo 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.110
 so you do not look uneven 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.940
 I'm doing there 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.970
 the antenitas 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.120
 with very wet acrylic for 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.330
 I can mold it and slip it a bit 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.009
 easier 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.009
 and I'm going to do 2 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.500
 Well, that's how the 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.500
 the butterfly very simple to make 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.030
 here already dry and now with the eyeliner 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.890
 black 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.350
 and that it's also organic that I'm going to 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.900
 delineate the wings of the butterfly to 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.900
 to enhance a little more the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.030
 in the dimension that I just did 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.120
 contouring with him 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.320
 very thin with this eyeliner and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.320
 I made the one above now the one below 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.240
 very infinite and now I'm going to fill in the 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.030
 little body of the butterfly 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.249
 to delineate a little better and now 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.669
 it is more thin 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.829
 I'm going to make some lines in the middle of 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.449
 wings to give you a little more 

00:05:53.829 --> 00:06:00.779
 depth to the butterfly 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.439
 and that's how simple is how this is done 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.439
 butterfly 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.050
 and it can take off very easily as 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.960
 I mentioned them because this paper is 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.069
 borrow to do it with the main 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.069
 standards I will not wait 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.080
 and here I have my nail dry list lime 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:27.560
 polished 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.330
 nothing else I will clean with water and for 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.330
 alcohol with what you use 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.199
 in any employer he serves 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.199
 only remove the dust very well 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.620
 and below 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.030
 then now I'm going to put the gel 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.250
 the end is that he 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.250
 because I'll hit a few keys rings 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:04.260
 along the nail because I'm going to 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:07.400
 as if I was showing 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.400
 a branch 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.019
 where the butterfly can get 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.230
 well 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.310
 to be able to put the butterfly 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:27.760
 the stones that I'm going to use is going to be 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.760
 pink fuchsia this are number 8 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.470
 and I'm going to put everything antler 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:39.470
 to the tip of these pebbles 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:42.500
 there they are 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.420
 as well as a s forgiveness is born 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.430
 and with the same gel that had already 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.410
 put nothing else I'm going to put the I'm going to 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.650
 paste the butterfly and it will adhere 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:53.750
 alone now that the lamp has already 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.550
 it's not going to be it's need to put anything 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.060
 it is also to be stuck with acrylic but 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.950
 he did not want me so so thick and so 

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.680
 that's how it looks, I hope there's 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.220
 liked this design and then until the 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.220
 next
