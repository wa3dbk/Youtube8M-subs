I

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
I

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.200 
I
now<00:00:02.250> bring<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.850> threat<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.049> left<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:05.210> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
now bring the threat on the left and a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.370 
now bring the threat on the left and a
path<00:00:06.480> through<00:00:06.780> the<00:00:06.900> ring<00:00:07.350> from<00:00:08.040> bottom

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.980 

now<00:00:15.980> using<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.610> threat<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.180> make<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.360> ring<00:00:17.750> as

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
now using the threat to make a ring as

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:28.320 
now using the threat to make a ring as
well

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.170 

you<00:00:28.869> should<00:00:29.080> have<00:00:29.260> formed<00:00:29.740> two<00:00:29.980> rings<00:00:30.430> now<00:00:30.760> and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
you should have formed two rings now and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.370 
you should have formed two rings now and
they<00:00:31.990> are<00:00:32.020> interconnected<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.840> left<00:00:35.080> ring

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
they are interconnected is the left ring

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.970 
they are interconnected is the left ring
and<00:00:36.130> through<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.120> hole<00:00:37.360> as<00:00:37.660> shown<00:00:38.020> in<00:00:38.290> the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
and through the hole as shown in the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.190 
and through the hole as shown in the
video<00:00:39.570> yeah

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.170 

who<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.860> gently

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.040 

now<00:00:52.180> who<00:00:53.019> this<00:00:53.379> part<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.100> shred

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:17.090 

and<00:00:57.320> playing<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.280> through<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:59.000> hole<00:00:59.270> as<00:00:59.570> shown

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.249 

while<00:01:17.700> doing<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:19.040> try<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> adjust<00:01:21.259> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
while doing that try to adjust the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.149 
while doing that try to adjust the
bottom<00:01:22.650> threat

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.499 

so<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.509> form<00:01:29.840> two<00:01:30.679> rings<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.429> each<00:01:32.119> side

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
so that you form two rings on each side

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.649 
so that you form two rings on each side
one<00:01:33.109> on<00:01:33.140> each<00:01:33.469> side<00:01:34.840> now<00:01:35.840> pull<00:01:36.259> all<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.130> ends

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
one on each side now pull all the ends

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.709 
one on each side now pull all the ends
the<00:01:38.659> loose<00:01:38.899> ending<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> two<00:01:40.189> rings<00:01:40.819> put

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
the loose ending and the two rings put

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.690 
the loose ending and the two rings put
them<00:01:41.899> all<00:01:42.109> together

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.230 

until<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:48.840> form<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.469> knot<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> center<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.419 

the<00:01:54.240> ring<00:01:54.539> should<00:01:54.930> look<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:58.429> about

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
the ring should look at like this about

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:16.020 
the ring should look at like this about
this<00:01:59.579> size

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.680 

now<00:02:16.600> adjust<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.970> wings

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
now adjust the wings

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.120 
now adjust the wings
who<00:02:21.230> them<00:02:21.410> slightly<00:02:21.710> apart<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.680> they

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
who them slightly apart so that they

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.150 
who them slightly apart so that they
look<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.780> two<00:02:26.780> real<00:02:27.410> pair<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.950> wings<00:02:33.100> now<00:02:34.100> we

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
look like two real pair of wings now we

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160 
look like two real pair of wings now we
are<00:02:34.520> going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.850> make<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.540> body<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
are going to make the body of the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.120 
are going to make the body of the
Dragonfly<00:02:36.640> first<00:02:37.870> address<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.560> threat<00:02:39.920> at

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
Dragonfly first address the threat at

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.400 
Dragonfly first address the threat at
the<00:02:40.220> bottom<00:02:40.610> such<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.630> two<00:02:41.930> shot

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
the bottom such that the two shot

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.740 
the bottom such that the two shot
threads<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.390> center

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.880 

and<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.500> long<00:02:48.860> threads<00:02:49.480> are<00:02:50.480> each<00:02:50.960> side<00:02:51.290> one

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
and the long threads are each side one

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.400 
and the long threads are each side one
on<00:02:52.100> each<00:02:52.250> side

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.650 

now<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.010> should<00:02:57.130> arrange<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:58.090> ends<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:59.490> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
now we should arrange the ends of the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.890 
now we should arrange the ends of the
Dragonfly<00:03:01.660> as<00:03:02.050> shown<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.890> Centers<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.360> true

Dragonfly as shown the Centers the true
threat<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.100> center<00:03:06.490> should<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
threat in at the center should be the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.650 
threat in at the center should be the
short<00:03:07.300> one<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.840> on<00:03:08.740> each<00:03:09.670> side<00:03:10.000> there's<00:03:10.450> a

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
to one side then arrange the threads

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:54.310 
to one side then arrange the threads
as<00:05:45.090> shown

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.540

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:21.690 

make<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> circle<00:06:06.250> and<00:06:07.250> pull<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:08.540> ends

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:28.619 

now<00:06:22.300> cut<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:23.080> remaining<00:06:23.770> ends

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.219 

you<00:06:29.629> should<00:06:29.839> keep<00:06:30.109> two<00:06:30.439> ends<00:06:30.859> and<00:06:30.979> cut<00:06:31.689> the<00:06:32.689> the
