another video so this is Cypress pro on
the<00:00:09.090> map<00:00:09.269> uncaged<00:00:09.980> what<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.190> think<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.429> this

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the map uncaged what do I think of this

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.060 
the map uncaged what do I think of this
map<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.300> okay<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:13.049> was<00:00:13.320> actually<00:00:13.830> made<00:00:14.040> by

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
map it's okay it was actually made by

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.170 
map it's okay it was actually made by
the<00:00:14.309> by<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> guy<00:00:15.450> who<00:00:15.509> made<00:00:15.809> guardian<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
the by the guy who made guardian and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.730 
the by the guy who made guardian and
guardian<00:00:18.180> had<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.199> my<00:00:19.320> favorite

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
guardian had to be one of my favorite

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
guardian had to be one of my favorite
maps<00:00:20.430> from<00:00:20.609> 803<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:22.580> engaged<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:24.090> elements

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
maps from 803 so engaged some elements

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.910 
maps from 803 so engaged some elements
do<00:00:24.779> remind<00:00:25.019> me<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.380> Guardian<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:27.570> overall

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
do remind me of Guardian but overall

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.009 
do remind me of Guardian but overall
that's<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:30.269> favorite<00:00:30.539> map<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that's not really my my favorite map to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
that's not really my my favorite map to
be<00:00:31.170> honest<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> probably

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
be honest and and this is probably

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
be honest and and this is probably
largely<00:00:33.630> due<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.710> way<00:00:34.890> reach<00:00:35.430> plays

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
largely due to like the way reach plays

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
largely due to like the way reach plays
I<00:00:36.290> think<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> map<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.340> Mike<00:00:38.790> 803<00:00:39.300> or

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I think it was the map from Mike 803 or

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
I think it was the map from Mike 803 or
something<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.890> quite<00:00:41.040> quite

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
something it actually be quite quite

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880 
something it actually be quite quite
good<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> quite<00:00:42.420> interesting<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> play<00:00:43.079> well

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
good and quite interesting to play well

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
good and quite interesting to play well
just<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:44.940> jet<00:00:45.239> pack<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just because you can use jet pack and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
just because you can use jet pack and
stuff<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.520> across<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.000> map<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
stuff to to get across the map really

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.229 
stuff to to get across the map really
easily<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.050> sprint<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.579> certain<00:00:50.789> jumps

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
easily or sprint and make certain jumps

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.470 
easily or sprint and make certain jumps
it's<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.899> kind<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.879> breaks<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> map

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
it's just a kind of it breaks the map

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's just a kind of it breaks the map
apart<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> doesn't<00:00:55.620> work<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
apart and it just doesn't work and that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.720 
apart and it just doesn't work and that
goes<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> maps<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.600> halo<00:00:57.629> reach<00:00:58.730> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
goes for a lot of maps in halo reach so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.229 
goes for a lot of maps in halo reach so
this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.480> gameplay<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.699> that's<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> few<00:01:03.000> weeks

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this is a gameplay of that's a few weeks

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
this is a gameplay of that's a few weeks
old<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:04.350> gonna<00:01:04.559> record<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> live<00:01:05.070> gameplay

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
old i was gonna record a live gameplay

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
old i was gonna record a live gameplay
but<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> ground<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.619> reach<00:01:07.979> today

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
but then when I ground to reach today

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
but then when I ground to reach today
the<00:01:09.240> servers<00:01:09.750> were<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.439> i<00:01:10.850> spent<00:01:11.850> about

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the servers were down so i spent about

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.640 
the servers were down so i spent about
an<00:01:12.210> hour<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.680> playing<00:01:13.680> custom<00:01:14.310> games<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
an hour to playing custom games and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
an hour to playing custom games and
unfortunately<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.030> servers<00:01:18.030> didn't<00:01:18.270> come

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
unfortunately the servers didn't come

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.370 
unfortunately the servers didn't come
back<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.000> how<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
back up so what can you do how to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
back up so what can you do how to
postpone<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.590> life<00:01:22.799> gameplay<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:24.479> em

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
postpone my life gameplay for em

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
postpone my life gameplay for em
tomorrow<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:27.210> went<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> theater<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.460> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
tomorrow so i went to theater and this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.630 
tomorrow so i went to theater and this
is<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.850> i<00:01:29.880> found<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.680> ok<00:01:31.920> game<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
is what i found so it's an ok game I I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.390 
is what i found so it's an ok game I I
do<00:01:33.000> fairly<00:01:33.329> well<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:37.409> largely<00:01:37.770> due<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
do fairly well so it's largely due to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
do fairly well so it's largely due to
like<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.970> host<00:01:39.210> siper<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like a good host siper is really the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.039 
like a good host siper is really the
same<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.250> SWAT<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> mean<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.420> if

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
same with SWAT I mean if you don't if

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.530 
same with SWAT I mean if you don't if
you're<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.259> playing<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> good<00:01:43.829> host<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
you're not playing on the good host and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
you're not playing on the good host and
let's<00:01:45.540> say<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.840> playing<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.700> people<00:01:47.700> from

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
let's say you're playing and people from

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
let's say you're playing and people from
across<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> world<00:01:48.649> you're<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
across the world you're not going to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
across the world you're not going to
have<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.750> shots<00:01:52.020> registered<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
have your shots registered and it's very

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.700 
have your shots registered and it's very
frustrating<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.899> much<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.380> love<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
frustrating so you as much as I love to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.580 
frustrating so you as much as I love to
play<00:01:58.829> snipers<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.759> they<00:02:00.689> can't<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> quite

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
play snipers it's they can't get quite

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
play snipers it's they can't get quite
frustrating<00:02:02.189> when<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:03.240> shots<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.140> read

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
frustrating when your shots are not read

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.080 
frustrating when your shots are not read
registering<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:06.829> therefore<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> good

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
registering so therefore this was a good

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.840 
registering so therefore this was a good
game

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
game

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330 
game
their<00:02:10.000> hopes<00:02:10.210> was<00:02:10.360> okay<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.950> wasn't<00:02:11.950> my<00:02:12.160> host

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
their hopes was okay I wasn't my host

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.880 
their hopes was okay I wasn't my host
yeah<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.480> see<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.590> couple<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
yeah you will see in a couple of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790 
yeah you will see in a couple of
occasions<00:02:15.040> there<00:02:15.580> where<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.600> hitting<00:02:17.530> people

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
occasions there where I'm hitting people

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.000 
occasions there where I'm hitting people
in<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.220> face<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.640> nothing<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.570> happening<00:02:20.010> and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
in the face but nothing is happening and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.370 
in the face but nothing is happening and
but<00:02:21.760> even<00:02:21.940> even<00:02:22.390> though<00:02:23.020> nothing<00:02:23.290> was

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
but even even though nothing was

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.780 
but even even though nothing was
happening<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.830> was<00:02:23.860> still<00:02:24.160> good<00:02:24.400> holes<00:02:24.580> for

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
happening it was still good holes for

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.750 
happening it was still good holes for
some<00:02:24.910> reason<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:26.100> i'm<00:02:27.100> not<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> best<00:02:27.490> sniper

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
some reason so i'm not the best sniper

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.140 
some reason so i'm not the best sniper
I'm<00:02:28.180> okay<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:29.560> largely<00:02:30.100> largely<00:02:30.820> due<00:02:31.120> to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
I'm okay it's largely largely due to

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.300 
I'm okay it's largely largely due to
where<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.630> position<00:02:31.810> yourself<00:02:32.140> on<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.160> map

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
where you position yourself on the map

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.400 
where you position yourself on the map
and<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.620> people<00:02:36.090> tend<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.380> go<00:02:38.380> for

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
and a lot of people tend to go for

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.130 
and a lot of people tend to go for
close-range<00:02:38.950> combat<00:02:39.330> when<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> bank<00:02:40.660> snipers

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
close-range combat when the bank snipers

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.430 
close-range combat when the bank snipers
I<00:02:41.290> tend<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.890> avoid<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.460> although<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:44.140> saying

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
I tend to avoid that although in saying

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.230 
I tend to avoid that although in saying
that<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.650> don't<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.100> see<00:02:45.340> across<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.060> map

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
that I don't like to see across the map

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.840 
that I don't like to see across the map
and<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.630> camp<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.800> scoped<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.730> whole

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and just camp and scoped in the whole

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.550 
and just camp and scoped in the whole
time<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.210> know<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.540> takes<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.320> fun<00:02:50.350> away

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
time you know that takes the fun away

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.160 
time you know that takes the fun away
from<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.280> am<00:02:51.940> an<00:02:52.120> action-packed<00:02:52.750> kind<00:02:53.080> of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
from it I am an action-packed kind of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.470 
from it I am an action-packed kind of
player<00:02:53.350> like<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:54.070> had<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.640> make<00:02:54.760> good<00:02:54.910> place<00:02:55.180> but

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
player like I had to make good place but

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
player like I had to make good place but
I<00:02:55.540> don't<00:02:56.260> look<00:02:56.440> for<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> sniper

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
I don't look for the for a sniper

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.050 
I don't look for the for a sniper
beatdown<00:02:58.720> kind<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.200> combo<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.520> take<00:03:00.700> out<00:03:00.910> the

beatdown kind of combo to take out the

beatdown kind of combo to take out the
enemies<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.510> prefer<00:03:01.840> just<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:03.280> fight<00:03:03.790> medium

that were elsewhere they will spawn and

the<00:03:19.990> map<00:03:20.170> as<00:03:20.350> as<00:03:20.590> well<00:03:20.980> as<00:03:21.070> we<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.400> I'm<00:03:21.670> playing

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the map as as well as we can I'm playing

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.170 
the map as as well as we can I'm playing
with<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:22.720> other<00:03:22.900> guy<00:03:23.550> my<00:03:24.550> team<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.970> was

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
with one other guy my team that I was

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.530 
with one other guy my team that I was
actually<00:03:25.270> playing<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.680> as<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:28.240> can<00:03:28.330> see

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
actually playing with so as you can see

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.510 
actually playing with so as you can see
i<00:03:28.810> think<00:03:29.140> he<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.440> positioned<00:03:29.980> yeah<00:03:30.400> he's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
i think he is positioned yeah he's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.120 
i think he is positioned yeah he's
positioned<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.180> top<00:03:31.600> landing<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.770> he<00:03:32.980> can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
positioned on the top landing so he can

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.760 
positioned on the top landing so he can
watch<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.490> sniper<00:03:33.880> spawn<00:03:34.180> at<00:03:34.330> all<00:03:34.840> times<00:03:35.170> and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
watch the sniper spawn at all times and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.730 
watch the sniper spawn at all times and
I<00:03:35.950> watching<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> rocket<00:03:36.520> 10<00:03:36.880> times<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.740> even

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
I watching the rocket 10 times and even

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.560 
I watching the rocket 10 times and even
though<00:03:38.980> i<00:03:39.010> had<00:03:39.220> taken<00:03:39.520> out<00:03:39.610> there<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.210> that's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
though i had taken out there and that's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.930 
though i had taken out there and that's
it's<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.350> good<00:03:41.470> angle<00:03:41.620> there<00:03:42.160> doesn't<00:03:42.790> does<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
it's a good angle there doesn't does a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.690 
it's a good angle there doesn't does a
nice<00:03:43.150> job<00:03:43.210> by<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.630> enemy<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.860> take<00:03:45.070> me<00:03:45.220> out<00:03:45.570> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
nice job by the enemy to take me out and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.970 
nice job by the enemy to take me out and
so<00:03:48.700> my<00:03:48.850> teammate<00:03:49.210> he<00:03:49.540> dies<00:03:49.810> he<00:03:50.200> calls<00:03:50.710> up<00:03:50.860> this

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
so my teammate he dies he calls up this

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.890 
so my teammate he dies he calls up this
guy<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.610> shoot<00:03:52.120> nothing<00:03:52.540> happened<00:03:52.840> so

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
guy here I shoot nothing happened so

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.490 
guy here I shoot nothing happened so
that<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:54.340> proves<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.500> connection

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
that just it proves that this connection

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.980 
that just it proves that this connection
was<00:03:56.710> there<00:03:57.010> well<00:03:57.880> as<00:03:58.240> I<00:03:58.360> said<00:03:58.510> before<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.900> was

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
was there well as I said before it was

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.780 
was there well as I said before it was
it<00:03:59.170> was<00:03:59.350> good<00:03:59.560> but<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.010> know<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.130> wasn't<00:04:00.430> spot

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
it was good but you know I wasn't spot

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.320 
it was good but you know I wasn't spot
on<00:04:00.940> either<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> made<00:04:03.820> my<00:04:03.940> way<00:04:03.970> back<00:04:04.120> up

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
on either and so I made my way back up

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.590 
on either and so I made my way back up
here<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:06.010> can<00:04:06.310> watch<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:06.610> tower<00:04:07.060> spawn<00:04:07.420> as

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
here and I can watch the tower spawn as

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.340 
here and I can watch the tower spawn as
well

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
well

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.180 
well
so<00:04:09.070> it's<00:04:09.460> a<00:04:09.580> good<00:04:09.760> angle<00:04:10.390> up<00:04:11.140> there<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.770> watch

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
so it's a good angle up there to watch
