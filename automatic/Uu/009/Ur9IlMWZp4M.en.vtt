00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.120
 diving is very easy because you are not only complaining and who 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.189
 decided to connect with another flight madero 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.279
 now but let's say you could tackle the fucking plane the same is the place 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.359
 where larissa most wants to be the middle and obviously but with the arrival 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.489
 of the flight on each side I'm going to complain but coincidentally a certain draft a mambo 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.600
 I more man 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.850

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.210

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.270

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.030
 methane said bands 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.659

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.240
 let's say that after they are horrible year you get up and you have a horrible pain 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.810

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.659
 will land on what is next 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.430
 just at the moment when the plane stops everyone gets up and 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.229
 the hatch the site is open 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.229
 and everything in the hatch everyone moves so 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.409
 or for this year 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.949
 leave the plane and a disembodied international flight will be taken 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.059
 walk 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.079
 walk 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.079

 this text but as well as 50 kilos of so much walking or of everything that does not 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.909
 you ate because it's very expensive it costs more than two 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.229
 this is the migration queue 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.259

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.199

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.609

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.930

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.069
 terrero

 young offices under 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.479

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 bush 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.109
 and they care 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.360
 Of course it's not obviously the bad look that you're importing products 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.520

 answer that 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.590
 what can you do 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.479
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.669

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:51.999
 lookout 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.999
 if that was the fastest and safest way to travel 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.009
 but because it has to be a pizarro like it has to be so spiked and 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.480
 deficient 4 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.150
