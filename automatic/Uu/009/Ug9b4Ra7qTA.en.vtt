video now the hero4 silver does not have
the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.170> 4k<00:00:16.680> capabilities<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> hero4

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the same 4k capabilities as the hero4

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.929 
the same 4k capabilities as the hero4
black<00:00:18.180> does<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:19.080> only<00:00:19.260> shoots<00:00:19.500> 4k<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.189> 15<00:00:20.520> FPS

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
black does it only shoots 4k and 15 FPS

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.910 
black does it only shoots 4k and 15 FPS
which<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.300> pretty<00:00:21.660> useless<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
which is pretty useless but one thing it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920 
which is pretty useless but one thing it
does<00:00:23.130> share<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> hero4<00:00:23.880> black<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.539> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
does share with the hero4 black is it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
does share with the hero4 black is it
has<00:00:25.050> improved<00:00:25.529> night<00:00:26.099> time<00:00:26.430> lapse<00:00:26.699> functions

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
has improved night time lapse functions

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
has improved night time lapse functions
so<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.750> decided<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> downtown<00:00:28.800> Chicago

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

specifically<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> GoPro<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
specifically for the GoPro this is a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
specifically for the GoPro this is a
circular<00:00:58.230> polarizer<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.609> our

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
circular polarizer we use this for our

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
circular polarizer we use this for our
time<00:00:59.850> lapse<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.239> well<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.170> screw<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> on

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
time lapse as well you just screw it on

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.060 
time lapse as well you just screw it on
to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> filter<00:01:02.820> holder<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.650> what<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> circular

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to the filter holder and what a circular

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
to the filter holder and what a circular
polarizer<00:01:05.369> does<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.600> allows<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> by

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
polarizer does is it allows you by

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.850 
polarizer does is it allows you by
simply<00:01:08.130> turning<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.880> front<00:01:09.150> element<00:01:09.860> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
simply turning the front element to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.929 
simply turning the front element to
block<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.720> reflections<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> glare<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.549> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
block out reflections and glare so for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
block out reflections and glare so for
instance<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> were<00:01:15.600> shooting<00:01:15.869> say<00:01:16.530> water

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
instance if you were shooting say water

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
instance if you were shooting say water
and<00:01:17.220> he<00:01:17.310> wanted<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> shoot<00:01:18.540> through<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and he wanted to shoot through the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
and he wanted to shoot through the
reflection<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.860> -<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.189> underneath<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
reflection and - it was underneath you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
reflection and - it was underneath you
would<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.299> adjust<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> until<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> knocked

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
would just adjust this until you knocked

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
would just adjust this until you knocked
out<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> reflection<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> could<00:01:24.030> see

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
out that reflection and you could see

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
out that reflection and you could see
down<00:01:24.299> below<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.500> were<00:01:25.650> shooting

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
down below so like if you were shooting

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
down below so like if you were shooting
goldfish<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> pond<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.150> something<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
goldfish in a pond or something this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
goldfish in a pond or something this
would<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> great<00:01:28.380> tool<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.189> also<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.670> great

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
would be a great tool it's also a great

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.990 
would be a great tool it's also a great
tool<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.420> reduce<00:01:30.720> glare<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.439> objects<00:01:32.040> say<00:01:32.790> for

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
tool to reduce glare off objects say for

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
tool to reduce glare off objects say for
instance<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.810> big<00:01:34.229> silver<00:01:35.009> object<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.939> may

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
instance some big silver object that may

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.620 
instance some big silver object that may
be<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.600> downtown<00:01:37.079> Chicago<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:39.030> beam<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
be in downtown Chicago the beam and we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
be in downtown Chicago the beam and we
did<00:01:40.500> use<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.310> purpose<00:01:41.549> as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
did use this for that very purpose as

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.399 
did use this for that very purpose as
you'll<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> moment<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.840> decided

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you'll see in a moment now we decided

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380
