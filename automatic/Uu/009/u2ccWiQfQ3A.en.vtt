00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
noticed that the handle we do this is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.380 
noticed that the handle we do this is
not<00:02:59.770> straight<00:03:00.250> doesn't<00:03:00.820> really<00:03:00.940> push<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.360> with

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
try a cell phone survey but that's kind

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.390 
try a cell phone survey but that's kind
of<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> idea<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.650> knife<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.040> designed

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
of the idea is that a knife is designed

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.729 
of the idea is that a knife is designed
to<00:03:10.670> give<00:03:11.090> your<00:03:11.720> hand<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.020> break<00:03:12.260> 10

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
to give your hand a break 10

to give your hand a break 10
earlier<00:03:15.739> this<00:03:16.370> point<00:03:16.910> why<00:03:17.270> that's<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:18.950> a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
earlier this point why that's this is a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.479 
earlier this point why that's this is a
great<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.400> easy<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:19.910> not<00:03:20.150> all<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.110> way

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
great as easy it's not all the way

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.699 
great as easy it's not all the way
checked<00:03:22.489> out<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.569> occured<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:24.590> you

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
checked out it just occured and then you

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.740 
checked out it just occured and then you
have<00:03:24.890> at<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.880> break<00:03:26.090> easily<00:03:26.450> if<00:03:26.660> you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.000 
have at it so the break easily if you
were<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.020> drop<00:03:27.230> it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
