00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Thurner 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.089
 on every single page it matters 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.759
 at least 232 pieces stuck to him 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.659
 The piano maker gives them the finishing touch 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.800
 that's good for the race 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.360
 It is also important for the country if only it is her 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.410
 It looks good, so it only feels good 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.030
 this is my living room 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.870
 round 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 in the approximately 1300 klein-wiele are annually in the German factory of the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.950
 Gladiators Pechstein made 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.970
 most in the hand 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.120
 From the first steps to the delivery there are nine months 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.960
 because for the production of a good instrument one needs opinion 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 the traditional company a lot of time 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.340
 the employees 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.290
 have to be the food 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 because sometimes millimeters decide about it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.150
 like the sound 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.400
 later sounds 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 we feel us 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 for how much longer 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 the company is therefore our duty 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.320
 ultimately became 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.439
 but it does not work without machines 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.689
 the technical effort 20 off 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.689
 if you have to produce many pieces precisely 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.990
 Several tens of thousands of euros can actually stand for the cost 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 The company focuses on quality tools rather than the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.650
 inexpensive machine-made products from the Far East can hardly do it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.759
 keep up 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.580
 here in the Saxon workshop 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.089
 how deep is the unique piece 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.369
 and the artisan 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 can bring in self 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.759
 every leaf 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.529
 probably every part of what I take in the hand 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 in a structure 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 I only know that sex explanation 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.039
 I'm already fit when I grow Werder is growing 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.039
 that is somehow brought closer, that is neat 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.349
 the instrument 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.589
 I am very proud 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.579
 The high art of little Mirco has been playing for ten min 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.259
 mirror 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.279
 Here the keys are made to sound 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.869
 here the master can refine the do 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.789
 For that patience needed experience and empathy 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.880
 here you have one now 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.909
 instrument 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.919
 that brings the first time tested well 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.919
 Uwe Riehs and guidelines what changes in the second 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.790
 Langenfeld do when I play there at least to the occurrence and above all 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.919
 also in the winter 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.939
 Karl Quade Cooper industrial processes or run twice as fast 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.969
 can make checks 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.689
 or can I design it well so in the end 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:32.400
 now you can 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.150
 The goal is to disturb all my colleagues 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 either this will end so and get the best out of what that can do 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 but often not the
