and then just wrong

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.630 
and then just wrong
so<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.380> do<00:04:41.620> is<00:04:41.770> just<00:04:41.920> twist<00:04:42.220> up<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.460> hair

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
so all you do is just twist up the hair

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.270 
so all you do is just twist up the hair
make<00:04:43.210> sure<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.480> get<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:44.380> little<00:04:44.560> indents<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
make sure you get the little indents and

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.239 
make sure you get the little indents and
the<00:04:45.460> small<00:04:45.730> ones

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.039 

I'm<00:04:50.759> just<00:04:50.969> going<00:04:51.119> to<00:04:51.179> curl<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.659> rest<00:04:51.869> of<00:04:51.989> my
