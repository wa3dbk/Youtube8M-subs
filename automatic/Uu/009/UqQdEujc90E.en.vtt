penalties and win some races now one of
the<00:00:34.829> first<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.280> you're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> notice

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the first things you're going to notice

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910 
the first things you're going to notice
with<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.390> new<00:00:36.570> tech<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> carbon<00:00:37.710> fiber

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
with our new tech is the carbon fiber

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
with our new tech is the carbon fiber
housing<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:39.300> switch<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> plastic<00:00:40.379> case

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
housing we switch from a plastic case

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.479 
housing we switch from a plastic case
over<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:41.610> carbon<00:00:42.270> fiber<00:00:42.480> housing<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
over to the new carbon fiber housing and

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.830 
over to the new carbon fiber housing and
we<00:00:44.489> were<00:00:44.579> able<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.879> reduce<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.450> weight<00:00:45.600> by

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
we were able to reduce the weight by

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
we were able to reduce the weight by
more<00:00:46.079> than<00:00:46.110> twenty<00:00:46.590> percent<00:00:47.059> now<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.270> takes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
more than twenty percent now this takes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.170 
more than twenty percent now this takes
out<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> lot<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> high<00:00:49.320> wait<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> car<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> as

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
out a lot of high wait in the car and as

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.790 
out a lot of high wait in the car and as
you<00:00:51.600> guys<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.890> every<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.370> bit<00:00:53.520> counts

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
you guys know every little bit counts

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.750 
you guys know every little bit counts
now<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.160> things<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.670> going

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
now one of the other things you're going

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
now one of the other things you're going
to<00:00:56.850> notice<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.809> new<00:00:57.960> slim<00:00:58.230> profile<00:00:58.890> bezel

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to notice is the new slim profile bezel

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
to notice is the new slim profile bezel
we've<00:01:00.090> done<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.480> things<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
we've done two things with this it's a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
we've done two things with this it's a
lower<00:01:01.800> profile<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.120> doesn't<00:01:03.300> protrude<00:01:03.750> off

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
lower profile so it doesn't protrude off

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740 
lower profile so it doesn't protrude off
of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> window<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.150> we've<00:01:06.150> also<00:01:06.360> been

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of the window as much we've also been

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
of the window as much we've also been
able<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.380> expand<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.880> viewable<00:01:09.270> area<00:01:09.420> by

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
able to expand on the viewable area by

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
able to expand on the viewable area by
twenty<00:01:10.110> percent<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> done<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
twenty percent what this is done is it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
twenty percent what this is done is it
has<00:01:12.750> allowed<00:01:13.080> us<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> pit<00:01:13.979> road<00:01:14.130> speed

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
has allowed us to put the pit road speed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
has allowed us to put the pit road speed
indicators<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> outside<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
indicators around the outside of the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.800 
indicators around the outside of the
tack<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> we've<00:01:17.100> also<00:01:17.280> increased<00:01:17.850> our<00:01:18.270> sweep

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
tack and we've also increased our sweep

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.100 
tack and we've also increased our sweep
from<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> 270<00:01:20.250> degree<00:01:20.520> sweep<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> 300-degree

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
from a 270 degree sweep to a 300-degree

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
from a 270 degree sweep to a 300-degree
sweep<00:01:24.140> now<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.619> combined<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.430> allow

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
sweep now all this combined will allow

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
sweep now all this combined will allow
for<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.960> maximize<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.799> resolution<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
for you to maximize the resolution on

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
for you to maximize the resolution on
your<00:01:29.790> tack<00:01:30.030> face<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.659> order<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.320> convey<00:01:31.710> all

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
your tack face in order to convey all

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
your tack face in order to convey all
the<00:01:32.189> necessary<00:01:32.759> information<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the necessary information now as you can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010 
the necessary information now as you can
see<00:01:34.409> we've<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.070> added<00:01:35.460> additional<00:01:36.329> pit<00:01:36.840> road

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
see we've also added additional pit road

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
see we've also added additional pit road
speed<00:01:37.320> indicator<00:01:37.890> lights<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.939> also<00:01:39.090> be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
speed indicator lights you can also be

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.920 
speed indicator lights you can also be
used<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.990> monitor<00:01:40.470> cornering<00:01:41.340> rpm<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> your

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

high red line shift point and these are

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
high red line shift point and these are
all<00:01:46.020> set<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.829> within<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.369> rpm<00:01:48.119> accuracy
