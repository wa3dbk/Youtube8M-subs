what<00:00:25.500> rigging<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.310> why<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.910> needed<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
what rigging is and why it's needed in

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.410 
what rigging is and why it's needed in
production

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
production

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
production
the<00:00:30.420> scene<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> rigging<00:00:31.199> basics<00:00:31.679> 0<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.160> begin

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the scene is rigging basics 0 to begin

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.750 
the scene is rigging basics 0 to begin
in<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.210> project<00:00:33.750> files<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> rigging

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
in your project files so what is rigging

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 
in your project files so what is rigging
well<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.540> boils<00:00:36.719> down<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.200> building

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
well it all boils down to building

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.910 
well it all boils down to building
controls<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.840> manipulate<00:00:39.840> objects<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
controls to manipulate objects and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240 
controls to manipulate objects and
models<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> our<00:00:41.969> scene<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> why<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.219> we

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
models in our scene now why would we

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850 
models in our scene now why would we
need<00:00:44.550> rigging<00:00:45.000> well<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:46.170> after<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
need rigging well a lot of times after a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.450 
need rigging well a lot of times after a
modeler<00:00:47.750> has<00:00:48.750> built<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.530> character<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.340> what

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
modeler has built a character it's what

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
modeler has built a character it's what
we<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.820> before<00:00:51.570> us<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.710> then<00:00:52.890> went<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> have

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
we see before us we then went to have

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
we see before us we then went to have
that<00:00:54.000> care<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.420> move<00:00:54.629> around<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.350> want<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> put

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that care to move around we want to put

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
that care to move around we want to put
a<00:00:56.129> skeleton<00:00:56.940> inside<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.719> character<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
a skeleton inside that character and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
a skeleton inside that character and
then<00:00:58.920> creates<00:00:59.430> controls<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.359> drive<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
then creates controls to drive that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.590 
then creates controls to drive that
skeleton<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.070> turn<00:01:02.300> move<00:01:03.300> our

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
skeleton which will in turn move our

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
skeleton which will in turn move our
character<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> without<00:01:05.400> rigging<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.000> wouldn't

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
character so without rigging we wouldn't

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
character so without rigging we wouldn't
be<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.430> several

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
be able to do that now there are several

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
be able to do that now there are several
types<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:10.220> levels<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:12.020> complexity<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
types of levels of complexity when it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
types of levels of complexity when it
comes<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> rigging<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> more

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
comes to rigging we have the more

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.399 
comes to rigging we have the more
advanced<00:01:16.409> type<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> rigging<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:19.170> type

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
advanced type of rigging and that type

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.429 
advanced type of rigging and that type
of<00:01:19.439> rigging<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.189> we'd<00:01:20.340> use<00:01:20.520> for

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
of rigging is what we'd use for

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.200 
of rigging is what we'd use for
character<00:01:22.439> animation<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> were<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> hit

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
character animation so if we were to hit

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
character animation so if we were to hit
play<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> our<00:01:24.600> scene<00:01:24.840> I'll<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
play in our scene I'll just go to the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.850 
play in our scene I'll just go to the
play<00:01:26.369> controls<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> hit<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> play<00:01:27.330> button

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
play controls and hit the play button

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.020 
play controls and hit the play button
you'll<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.369> our<00:01:29.400> character<00:01:29.850> moving

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you'll see we have our character moving

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.289 
you'll see we have our character moving
around<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.000> idea

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
around in a way where we get an idea

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.140 
around in a way where we get an idea
that<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.810> character<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.680> now<00:01:35.520> living<00:01:35.850> has

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that this character is now living has

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.469 
that this character is now living has
some<00:01:36.509> type<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.869> personality<00:01:37.729> now<00:01:38.759> rigging<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
some type of personality now rigging can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.240 
some type of personality now rigging can
also<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.229> basic<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.450> here

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
also be as basic as what we see here

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.569 
also be as basic as what we see here
with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> cube<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.030> being<00:01:45.360> squashed<00:01:46.579> yes

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
with the cube that's being squashed yes

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
with the cube that's being squashed yes
that<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:48.000> been<00:01:48.030> rigged<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.840> well<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.500> can

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that has been rigged as well so we can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.569 
that has been rigged as well so we can
have<00:01:49.890> squash<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> stretch<00:01:50.840> deformations

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
have squash and stretch deformations

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.980 
have squash and stretch deformations
alright<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.479> understand<00:01:54.930> what

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
alright so now that we understand what

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.459 
alright so now that we understand what
rigging<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> why<00:01:57.140> rigging<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
rigging is and why rigging it's so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.429 
rigging is and why rigging it's so
essential<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.180> production<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
essential in production I'm going to go

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
essential in production I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.740> stop<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> lesson<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
ahead and stop the lesson here in the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270 
ahead and stop the lesson here in the
next<00:02:03.270> lesson<00:02:03.630> we'll<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> look<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
next lesson we'll take a look at the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.399 
next lesson we'll take a look at the
most<00:02:05.520> basic<00:02:06.180> form<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.750> rigging<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.259> is

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
most basic form of rigging which is

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.369 
most basic form of rigging which is
called<00:02:07.740> parenting
