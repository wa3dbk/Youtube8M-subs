00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.900
 no big deal 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.150

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 about ten minutes while I have them

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.350
 for baking 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.480
 here I have already added garlic and so little 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.980
 just worth it so I took this recipe 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.090
 certainly from the internet with some 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.670
 culinary site 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.510
 I corrected him a little then 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:33.400
 there may be you like it as in 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.459
 original there cream garlic still 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.480
 greens added to the court and there too 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.239
 is added 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.690
 sir i don't do greens of course 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.030
 You can add here I tried the greens 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.940
 also very tasty is dill or parsley 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 Here I have just cream 20 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.290
 interest and garlic then I'm right here 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.469
 meatballs show 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.849
 I bake a little bit then with this 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.269
 pour sauce 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.549
 and sprinkle cheese on top for some reason 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.730
 I like it better because I did 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.219
 according to the original recipe of this put about 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.260
 that cheese like you all stay here at the bottom 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:15.079
 bowls and therefore account for all this 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.880
 from there scratch pick out and so 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:23.870
 further wet cheese is obtained and what 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.560
 such chunks are already rubbed for no purpose 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.720
 liked it and how it will be a little bit 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.449
 corrected this recipe for themselves 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.220
 so as you like, as you like 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.270

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.349

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.599
