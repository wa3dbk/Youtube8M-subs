 how to install whatsapp in what is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.420
 an ipod touch and our ipad I thought 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 that this was already known by many people 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 that it was not so necessary to make them 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 but I realized that if many 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 people know they keep asking me 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.730
 as I have and whatsapp on the ipad so 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.800

 drawbacks here we're going to tell you a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.379
 time when you want to synchronize 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.799
 our ipod or our ipad is going to 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.590
 ask that we give access or that we always 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.950
 will ask us to give access only 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.680
 We give in not giving access and will erase the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.260
 WhatsApp good the forgiveness WhatsApp 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.690
 will erase what we have to do 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.470
 it is simply to leave it saved in 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.690
 installous 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.730
 when we already turned to this external 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.470
 ipad we just install it again 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.510

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.980
