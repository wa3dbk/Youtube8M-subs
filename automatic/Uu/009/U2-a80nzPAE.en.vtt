00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.839 
half inch angle tipped brush and I like
to<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.670> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> start<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> top<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.849> so

I<00:00:29.939> hold<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.630> brush<00:00:31.340> just<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.669> angle<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I hold my brush just at an angle and I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.860 
I hold my brush just at an angle and I
very<00:00:33.750> carefully<00:00:34.579> follow<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> line<00:00:36.059> take<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
very carefully follow the line take it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
very carefully follow the line take it
to<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> bottom<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> curve<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.660> go

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to the bottom of the curve and now go

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.400 
to the bottom of the curve and now go
down<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.210> actually<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:43.079> I'll

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
down and actually on going down I'll

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.270 
down and actually on going down I'll
take<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:45.590> over<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.039> edge<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> my<00:00:47.460> pencil<00:00:48.090> line

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
take it over the edge of my pencil line

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
take it over the edge of my pencil line
and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.660> wet<00:00:51.899> rag<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and then I can just take my wet rag and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.479 
and then I can just take my wet rag and
just<00:00:53.550> wipe<00:00:54.120> away<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.600> part<00:00:55.219> where<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> went

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
just wipe away the part where I went

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
just wipe away the part where I went
over<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> gives<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> nice<00:00:58.920> clean

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
over and that gives me a nice clean

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.900 
over and that gives me a nice clean
corner<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.910> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
corner so that I can just go back and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.580 
corner so that I can just go back and
kind<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> carefully<00:01:04.670> touch<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:07.939> edges

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
kind of carefully touch up the edges

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.020 
kind of carefully touch up the edges
that<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> missed<00:01:11.310> getting<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.790> close

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that I kind of missed getting as close

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
that I kind of missed getting as close
to<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.479> pencil<00:01:12.900> line<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.200> i<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to my pencil line as i can and then I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.530 
to my pencil line as i can and then I
just<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> keep<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:17.180> again<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
just kind of keep going again I just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:28.730 
just kind of keep going again I just
follow<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> curve<00:01:22.610> with<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.880> brush<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:27.619> if<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
follow the curve with my brush and if I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.819 
follow the curve with my brush and if I
go<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.970> okay<00:01:30.829> because

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
go over a little bit that's okay because

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.590

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.639 

just<00:01:42.640> like<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.310> gets<00:01:45.490> my<00:01:45.729> nice<00:01:46.030> clean<00:01:46.570> out
