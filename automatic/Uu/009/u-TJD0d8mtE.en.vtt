on the left hand side with the break

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.529 
on the left hand side with the break
strand<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> create<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> loop<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.420> if

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
strand I'm going to create a loop and if

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
strand I'm going to create a loop and if
you<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:54.780> closely<00:00:55.050> you'll<00:00:55.350> notice<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you look closely you'll notice that the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
you look closely you'll notice that the
break<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.180> behind<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.050> load<00:00:58.289> meaning<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
break is behind the load meaning that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.180 
break is behind the load meaning that
the<00:00:59.789> strand<00:01:00.090> coming<00:01:00.449> behind<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.230> what's<00:01:02.039> going

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the strand coming behind is what's going

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
the strand coming behind is what's going
to<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.460> loose<00:01:02.699> pile<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> rope<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.600> left<00:01:03.840> over

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to my loose pile of rope my left over

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
to my loose pile of rope my left over
I'm<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> take<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.400> loop<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
I'm then going to take this loop and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
I'm then going to take this loop and
simply<00:01:06.720> clip<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> carabiner

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
simply clip it in to the carabiner

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
simply clip it in to the carabiner
making<00:01:09.060> sure<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> lock<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.930> carabiner<00:01:10.350> itself

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
making sure to lock the carabiner itself

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.330 
making sure to lock the carabiner itself
and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.240> good<00:01:12.540> Munter<00:01:12.900> hitch<00:01:13.340> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and I now have a good Munter hitch it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
and I now have a good Munter hitch it
works<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.760> both<00:01:14.820> taking<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.420> rope<00:01:15.659> when<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
works for both taking in rope when you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
works for both taking in rope when you
want<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> lower<00:01:16.799> somebody<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.520> knot<00:01:17.729> will

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
want to lower somebody the knot will

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.630 
want to lower somebody the knot will
nearly<00:01:18.180> rock<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.070> lower<00:01:20.310> somebody

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
nearly rock over you can lower somebody

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.420 
nearly rock over you can lower somebody
as<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> key<00:01:22.890> things<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.340> the
