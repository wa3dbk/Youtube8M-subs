when<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:54.690> talking<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.410> Native

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
when you're talking about the Native

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.189 
when you're talking about the Native
Americans<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.789> used<00:00:57.030> animal<00:00:57.539> skin<00:00:57.870> they

child how they want to design their

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.510 
child how they want to design their
locals<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.520> completely<00:02:00.060> accident<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
locals it's completely accident you can

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.580 
locals it's completely accident you can
talk<00:02:02.520> about

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
talk about

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.039 
talk about
the<00:02:03.979> kind<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.400> pattern<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.000> want<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.390> make<00:02:05.570> so

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
the kind of pattern you want to make so

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.140 
the kind of pattern you want to make so
we<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.130> first<00:02:07.460> make<00:02:08.110> our<00:02:09.110> pattern<00:02:09.970> I'm<00:02:10.970> going

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
we can first make our pattern I'm going

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.660 
we can first make our pattern I'm going
to<00:02:11.240> do<00:02:11.420> three<00:02:12.080> Reds<00:02:12.880> two<00:02:13.880> black<00:02:15.190> three<00:02:16.190> yellows

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
to do three Reds two black three yellows

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.740 
to do three Reds two black three yellows
and<00:02:17.060> there's<00:02:17.270> my<00:02:17.510> pattern<00:02:18.459> now<00:02:19.459> my<00:02:19.670> ask<00:02:19.910> my

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and there's my pattern now my ask my

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.750 
and there's my pattern now my ask my
child<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.319> repeat<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.920> pattern<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.580> what

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
child to repeat that pattern so what

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.660 
child to repeat that pattern so what
would<00:02:22.910> come<00:02:23.120> next<00:02:23.680> three<00:02:24.680> Reds<00:02:25.780> cheese<00:02:26.780> Rock

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
would come next three Reds cheese Rock

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.530 
would come next three Reds cheese Rock
maybe<00:02:28.670> yellow

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
maybe yellow

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.110 
maybe yellow
so<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.500> pattern<00:02:30.739> would<00:02:31.069> repeat<00:02:31.459> itself<00:02:31.670> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
so that pattern would repeat itself and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.699 
so that pattern would repeat itself and
I<00:02:32.209> would<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:33.250> my<00:02:34.250> child<00:02:34.750> make<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.290> pattern

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
I would have my child make the pattern

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.710 
I would have my child make the pattern
probably<00:02:37.280> about<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.730> length<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.390> man

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
probably about the length of this man

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.370 
probably about the length of this man
you<00:02:39.620> don't<00:02:39.739> want<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.070> too<00:02:40.250> long<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:42.230> would

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
you don't want it too long and we would

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.770 
you don't want it too long and we would
continue<00:02:42.739> repeating<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.489> pattern<00:02:43.730> then<00:02:44.660> we

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
continue repeating the pattern then we

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.740 
continue repeating the pattern then we
would<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.050> our<00:02:45.200> string<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> beauty<00:02:47.720> of
