00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey what's going on guys this is more of
a<00:00:03.120> test<00:00:03.389> video<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:04.080> anything<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.160> suppose<00:00:05.759> just

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
a test video and anything I suppose just

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.410 
a test video and anything I suppose just
to<00:00:06.299> see<00:00:06.480> if<00:00:06.660> like<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> audio<00:00:07.319> stays<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.010> sync

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
to see if like the audio stays in sync

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.160 
to see if like the audio stays in sync
then<00:00:09.420> I'll<00:00:09.540> go<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:11.120> trying<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> test<00:00:12.480> some

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
then I'll go on to trying to test some

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.250 
then I'll go on to trying to test some
emulator<00:00:13.620> stuff<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.309> uh<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.900> in<00:00:15.900> case<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
emulator stuff but uh and in case you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.660 
emulator stuff but uh and in case you
were<00:00:16.289> wondering<00:00:16.560> i'll<00:00:17.010> go<00:00:17.130> over<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.400> few<00:00:17.609> things

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
were wondering i'll go over a few things

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.050 
were wondering i'll go over a few things
since<00:00:18.180> i've<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:18.840> stuff<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.230> kill

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
since i've got some stuff to kill

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.580 
since i've got some stuff to kill
basically<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.330> i'm<00:00:21.420> done<00:00:21.720> making<00:00:22.170> movies

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
basically when i'm done making movies

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.220 
basically when i'm done making movies
this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.760> my<00:00:23.970> desktop<00:00:24.510> partially<00:00:25.050> looks

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this is what my desktop partially looks

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.830 
this is what my desktop partially looks
like<00:00:28.279> basically<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.550> pretty<00:00:30.150> much<00:00:30.300> starts

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
like basically it pretty much starts

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
like basically it pretty much starts
offices<00:00:32.030> these<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> face<00:00:33.930> movies<00:00:35.270> then

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
offices these are the face movies then

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.040 
offices these are the face movies then
they<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.730> Camtasia<00:00:38.870> that's<00:00:39.870> right

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they are going to Camtasia that's right

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
they are going to Camtasia that's right
and<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.829> edited<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.579> comes<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and they get edited which comes out to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
and they get edited which comes out to
this<00:00:42.980> unfortunately<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.969> videos<00:00:45.420> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this unfortunately these videos are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.220 
this unfortunately these videos are
somewhat<00:00:46.110> big<00:00:46.350> under<00:00:47.010> ninety<00:00:47.399> nine<00:00:47.579> megabytes

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
somewhat big under ninety nine megabytes

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
somewhat big under ninety nine megabytes
that's<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> biggest

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that's that's probably not the biggest

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
that's that's probably not the biggest
one<00:00:50.910> either<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:52.320> one's<00:00:52.530> 248<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:55.370> one's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
one either this one's 248 this one's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.420 
one either this one's 248 this one's
only<00:00:56.670> 107<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.770> don't<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.890> why<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.250> only

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
only 107 I don't know why that's only

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
only 107 I don't know why that's only
hundred<00:00:59.789> seven<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.239> whatever<00:01:00.539> 221<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
hundred seven but whatever 221 so it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
hundred seven but whatever 221 so it
seems<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.920> 240<00:01:02.579> something<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> biggest

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
seems like 240 something was the biggest

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.160 
seems like 240 something was the biggest
one<00:01:03.799> I<00:01:04.799> try<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> keep<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:06.060> mov<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> keep

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
one I try to keep them mov is to keep

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
one I try to keep them mov is to keep
quality<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.979> bit<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> uh<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.729> gets

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
quality a little bit up but uh it gets

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
quality a little bit up but uh it gets
kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> killed<00:01:13.430> once<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:15.090> program

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
kind of killed once this little program

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.940 
kind of killed once this little program
gets<00:01:15.630> opened<00:01:15.990> whenever<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.090> done<00:01:18.090> opening

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
gets opened whenever it's a done opening

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
gets opened whenever it's a done opening
taking<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.159> freaking<00:01:20.430> ever<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.850> going

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
taking for freaking ever now it's going

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
taking for freaking ever now it's going
to<00:01:21.030> open<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> wet<00:01:21.509> web<00:01:21.930> page<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to open up a wet web page because it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
to open up a wet web page because it's
gay<00:01:24.500> maybe<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.740> maybe<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.460> done<00:01:26.640> opening

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
gay maybe not maybe it's done opening

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
gay maybe not maybe it's done opening
their<00:01:27.150> stupid<00:01:27.479> web<00:01:27.630> page<00:01:27.840> anyway<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
their stupid web page anyway now you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.090 
their stupid web page anyway now you
change<00:01:29.909> something<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.509> anyway

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
change something in here anyway

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.970 
change something in here anyway
due<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.579> do

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.610 

there<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:42.230> really<00:01:43.230> don't<00:01:43.320> even<00:01:43.440> need

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
there it is I really don't even need

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.490 
there it is I really don't even need
that<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.190> this<00:01:45.090> compresses<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.260> video

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that right but this compresses the video

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.270 
that right but this compresses the video
media<00:01:46.890> color<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.940> fairly<00:01:48.570> good<00:01:48.690> program

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
media color just a fairly good program

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.390 
media color just a fairly good program
so<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.730> was<00:01:51.500> 248<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.370> a

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
so this was 248 it's not going to be a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.020 
so this was 248 it's not going to be a
huge<00:01:53.580> compression<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:55.130> audie<00:01:56.130> down<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
huge compression because audie down to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.710 
huge compression because audie down to
149<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.720> chops<00:02:00.720> off<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.170> 100<00:02:01.350> Meg's<00:02:02.720> when

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
149 so it chops off about 100 Meg's when

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.800 
149 so it chops off about 100 Meg's when
I<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.900> still<00:02:04.080> doing<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.560> AV<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.570> for<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
I was still doing the AV is for this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.200 
I was still doing the AV is for this
they<00:02:07.230> were<00:02:07.290> coming<00:02:07.650> out<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.210> 500

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
they were coming out of like 500

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.540 
they were coming out of like 500
megabytes<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> gig<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.040> then<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.490> were

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
megabytes to a gig and then they were

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.730 
megabytes to a gig and then they were
being<00:02:11.760> compressed<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.870> 50

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
being compressed down to about 50

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.730 
being compressed down to about 50
megabytes<00:02:14.370> which<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:14.880> really<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.840> made<00:02:16.590> up

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
megabytes which was really good made up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.530 
megabytes which was really good made up
loading<00:02:17.100> speed<00:02:17.520> here<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> killed<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
loading speed here but it killed the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.520 
loading speed here but it killed the
quality<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> that's<00:02:21.660> basically<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> use

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
quality so that's basically what I use

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.780 
quality so that's basically what I use
to<00:02:22.560> produce<00:02:23.360> um<00:02:26.300> what<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.330> use<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.570> edit<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to produce um what I use to edit the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.290 
to produce um what I use to edit the
intro<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:32.480> Photoshop<00:02:33.480> basically<00:02:35.300> smooth

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
intro is a Photoshop basically smooth

it's<00:02:48.930> pretty<00:02:49.170> good<00:02:49.290> tool<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.950> uh<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.709> use

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it's pretty good tool but uh so I use

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.380 
it's pretty good tool but uh so I use
Photoshop<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:54.510> any<00:02:54.950> picture<00:02:56.390> manipulation

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
Photoshop to do any picture manipulation

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.560 
Photoshop to do any picture manipulation
making<00:02:58.170> any<00:02:58.320> text<00:02:58.980> which<00:02:59.940> you<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.239> also<00:03:00.390> use

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
making any text which you can also use

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.210 
making any text which you can also use
an<00:03:00.959> After<00:03:01.260> Effects<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> program

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
an After Effects if you have the program

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.560 
an After Effects if you have the program
i<00:03:02.280> use<00:03:02.430> After<00:03:02.760> Effects<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.239> make<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> intros

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
i use After Effects to make the intros

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.020 
i use After Effects to make the intros
currently<00:03:06.950> pretty<00:03:07.950> much<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.280> entire<00:03:08.370> intro

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
currently pretty much the entire intro

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.570 
currently pretty much the entire intro
was<00:03:09.480> done<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.050> aftereffects<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.310> wasn't

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
was done in aftereffects so it wasn't

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.520 
was done in aftereffects so it wasn't
really<00:03:11.610> fancy<00:03:12.180> which<00:03:12.540> isn't<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:13.290> just

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
really fancy which isn't it it's just

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.070 
really fancy which isn't it it's just
intro<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> didn't<00:03:14.520> really<00:03:14.580> want<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.050> put<00:03:16.050> a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
intro so I didn't really want to put a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.270 
intro so I didn't really want to put a
whole<00:03:16.260> crapload<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.800> effort<00:03:17.100> into<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.570> but<00:03:18.570> uh

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
whole crapload of effort into it but uh

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.700 
whole crapload of effort into it but uh
yeah<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.960> pretty<00:03:21.960> much<00:03:22.140> going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.410> after

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
yeah the pretty much going to after

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.200 
yeah the pretty much going to after
effects<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.340> kind<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.640> got<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.910> know<00:03:23.970> how<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
effects you kind of got to know how to

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.060 
effects you kind of got to know how to
move<00:03:24.660> your<00:03:24.720> way<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.200> program<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.800> get<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
move your way to the program to get it

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.340 
move your way to the program to get it
done<00:03:26.220> or<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.640> can<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.330> know<00:03:27.600> people<00:03:27.900> make

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
done or you can just I know people make

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.950 
done or you can just I know people make
their<00:03:28.500> intros<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:28.980> cam<00:03:29.310> Camtasia<00:03:30.150> Studio<00:03:30.330> but

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
their intros and cam Camtasia Studio but

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.260 
their intros and cam Camtasia Studio but
since<00:03:31.890> I'm<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.430> school<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.060> type

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
since I'm going to school for this type

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.420 
since I'm going to school for this type
of<00:03:33.300> stuff<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.690> might<00:03:33.870> as<00:03:33.990> well<00:03:34.050> keep<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.220> some

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
of stuff I might as well keep up some

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.250 
of stuff I might as well keep up some
practice<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.090> how<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.240> maneuver<00:03:37.020> through<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
practice and how to maneuver through the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.820 
practice and how to maneuver through the
program<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:37.950> anyway<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:39.990> final

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
program but anyway this is the final

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.280 
program but anyway this is the final
product<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:42.950> making<00:03:43.950> seven<00:03:44.370> movies<00:03:44.870> yep<00:03:45.870> seven

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
product of making seven movies yep seven

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.020 
product of making seven movies yep seven
which<00:03:47.070> roughly<00:03:47.310> turns<00:03:47.640> into<00:03:47.850> 21<00:03:49.820> because<00:03:50.820> it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
which roughly turns into 21 because it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.830 
which roughly turns into 21 because it
goes<00:03:51.180> from<00:03:51.740> original<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:53.570> combine<00:03:54.570> with<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
goes from original to combine with the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.430 
goes from original to combine with the
intro<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.290> some<00:03:55.590> music<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.630> then<00:03:57.630> transcoded

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
intro and some music and then transcoded

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.060 
intro and some music and then transcoded
which<00:03:59.310> makes<00:03:59.580> them<00:03:59.700> smaller<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.070> hopefully

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
which makes them smaller so hopefully

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.910 
which makes them smaller so hopefully
this<00:04:02.310> test<00:04:02.580> video<00:04:02.820> goes<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.180> well<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.920> I'll

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
this test video goes out well and I'll

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.650 
this test video goes out well and I'll
be<00:04:05.070> able<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.340> use<00:04:05.490> this<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:06.150> better<00:04:06.450> quality

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
be able to use this for better quality

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.610 
be able to use this for better quality
videos<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.550> future
