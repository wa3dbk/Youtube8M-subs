00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
optional but you can also use hay and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120 
optional but you can also use hay and
put<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.630> litter<00:01:10.810> box<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.950> your

put that in the litter box so your

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.389

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
you where to put your litter box so as

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.460 
you where to put your litter box so as

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
you can see my litter boxes in the

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.190 
you can see my litter boxes in the
corner<00:01:29.830> under<00:01:30.099> the<00:01:30.789> hay<00:01:30.970> rack<00:01:31.209> and<00:01:31.539> I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
corner under the hay rack and I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.410 
corner under the hay rack and I
recommend<00:01:33.190> doing<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.610> because<00:01:33.849> it<00:01:34.119> keeps<00:01:34.240> it

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
recommend doing this because it keeps it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.930 
recommend doing this because it keeps it
nice<00:01:34.599> and<00:01:34.660> tidy<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.429> helps<00:01:36.429> your<00:01:36.550> rabbit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
nice and tidy and helps your rabbit

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.059 
nice and tidy and helps your rabbit
train<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:38.500> using<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.490> litter<00:01:39.640> box<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:41.069> when

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
train for using the litter box and when

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.770 
train for using the litter box and when
training<00:01:42.580> your<00:01:42.700> rabbit<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.179> recommend<00:01:43.720> not

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
training your rabbit I recommend not

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.839 
training your rabbit I recommend not
using<00:01:44.759> bedding<00:01:45.759> or<00:01:46.000> even<00:01:46.929> blankets<00:01:47.470> because

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
using bedding or even blankets because

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.600 
using bedding or even blankets because
that<00:01:48.849> can<00:01:49.060> really<00:01:49.420> uhm<00:01:50.310> become<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> problem

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
that can really uhm become a problem

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.270 
that can really uhm become a problem
because<00:01:51.880> your<00:01:52.420> rabbit<00:01:52.780> might<00:01:52.959> pee<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.709> lot<00:01:53.979> and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
because your rabbit might pee a lot and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.219 
because your rabbit might pee a lot and
you<00:01:54.819> might<00:01:55.060> need<00:01:55.239> to<00:01:55.390> wash<00:01:55.569> it<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.840> lot<00:01:55.989> and<00:01:56.110> that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
you might need to wash it a lot and that

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.029 
you might need to wash it a lot and that
can<00:01:56.349> cause<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> problem

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
can cause a problem

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.050 
can cause a problem
so<00:01:57.819> I<00:01:58.479> recommend<00:01:59.349> using<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.459> bottom<00:02:00.970> of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
so I recommend using just the bottom of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.290 
so I recommend using just the bottom of
the<00:02:01.179> cage<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:02.220> anyway<00:02:03.220> as<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.819> see<00:02:04.000> it's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
the cage so anyway as you can see it's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.680 
the cage so anyway as you can see it's
in<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.539> corner<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.880> your<00:02:07.060> rabbit<00:02:07.450> does

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
in the corner and when your rabbit does

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.990 
in the corner and when your rabbit does
pee<00:02:08.200> poop<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.920> litter<00:02:09.099> box<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.700> need

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
pee poop out of the litter box you need

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.180 
pee poop out of the litter box you need
to<00:02:10.119> wipe<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.450> up<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.869> put<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> litter

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.780 
to wipe it up and put it in the litter
box<00:02:13.080> everything<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.160> everything<00:02:15.580> so

box everything you use and everything so

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.910 
box everything you use and everything so
he<00:02:16.000> knows<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.660> all<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.170> smells<00:02:17.470> are<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
he knows that all the smells are in the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.890 
he knows that all the smells are in the
litter<00:02:18.040> box<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.970> he<00:02:19.000> knows<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.420> he<00:02:19.569> needs<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
litter box so he knows that he needs to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.250 
litter box so he knows that he needs to
get<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> restroom<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.769> there

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
get the restroom in there

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.740 
get the restroom in there
I<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:22.400> never<00:02:22.580> had<00:02:22.849> any<00:02:23.030> accidents<00:02:23.629> with

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
I have never had any accidents with

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.630 
I have never had any accidents with
stickers<00:02:23.989> because<00:02:24.590> he<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:24.860> fully<00:02:25.099> trained<00:02:25.489> in

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
stickers because he is fully trained in

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.690 
stickers because he is fully trained in
everything<00:02:26.439> but<00:02:27.439> that<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.890> why<00:02:28.040> we<00:02:28.310> use<00:02:28.340> litter

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
everything but that is why we use litter

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.720 
everything but that is why we use litter
boxes<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.420> not<00:02:30.010> trays<00:02:31.010> because<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:31.579> can

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
boxes and not trays because they can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.500 
boxes and not trays because they can
hurt<00:02:31.970> rabbit's<00:02:32.900> feet<00:02:33.079> and<00:02:33.319> cause<00:02:34.220> sore<00:02:35.209> Hawks

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
hurt rabbit's feet and cause sore Hawks

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.300 
hurt rabbit's feet and cause sore Hawks
so<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.140> why<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:36.439> use<00:02:36.470> litter<00:02:36.739> box<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so that's why we use litter box and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.649 
so that's why we use litter box and
they're<00:02:37.489> very<00:02:37.670> smart<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.269> they<00:02:38.329> can<00:02:38.510> learn

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
they're very smart and they can learn

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.050 
they're very smart and they can learn
quickly<00:02:39.079> or<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.409> can<00:02:39.620> learn<00:02:39.739> slowly<00:02:40.129> but

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
quickly or they can learn slowly but

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.089 
quickly or they can learn slowly but
eventually<00:02:41.329> they<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:41.959> get<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.379> so<00:02:42.560> keep<00:02:42.980> on

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
eventually they will get it so keep on

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.300 
eventually they will get it so keep on
trying<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:44.209> anyway<00:02:44.959> hope<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.860> enjoyed<00:02:46.159> this
