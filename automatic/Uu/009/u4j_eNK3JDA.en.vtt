to help the actual salt which we're

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.010 
to help the actual salt which we're
putting<00:00:45.020> on<00:00:45.140> next<00:00:45.470> adhere<00:00:46.070> nicely<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.750> salt

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.810 
on shelf number two here I know it's
number<00:01:42.650> two<00:01:42.860> because<00:01:43.400> they're<00:01:43.549> actually

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
number two because they're actually

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.730 
number two because they're actually
numbered<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.240> side<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.750> oven<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:45.200> so

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
numbered on the side of the oven here so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.590 
numbered on the side of the oven here so
closing<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.250> door<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.180> next<00:01:47.390> thing<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.540> need

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
closing the door the next thing I need

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.030 
closing the door the next thing I need
to<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:47.960> actually<00:01:48.110> turn<00:01:48.409> my<00:01:48.619> oven<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:48.950> and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
to do is actually turn my oven on and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.340 
to do is actually turn my oven on and
engage<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.670> control<00:01:50.030> panel<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:51.110> next

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
engage the control panel and the next

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.510 
engage the control panel and the next
step<00:01:51.500> for<00:01:51.680> me<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.920> actually<00:01:52.009> choose<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
step for me is to actually choose the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.149 
step for me is to actually choose the
automatic<00:01:52.790> programming<00:01:53.570> part<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.960> oven

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
automatic programming part of the oven

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.410 
automatic programming part of the oven
so<00:01:55.159> I'll<00:01:55.280> press<00:01:55.490> pre<00:01:55.700> which<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.090> automatic

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
so I'll press pre which is the automatic

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.730 
so I'll press pre which is the automatic
programming<00:01:56.840> part<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.409> moment<00:01:57.650> we're

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
programming part at the moment we're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
programming part at the moment we're
sitting<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.009> poultry<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:59.119> actually<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.509> to

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
sitting on poultry we actually want to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.180 
sitting on poultry we actually want to
take<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.840> away<00:01:59.990> from<00:02:00.290> poultry<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:00.770> turn<00:02:01.009> to

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
take that away from poultry and turn to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.249 
take that away from poultry and turn to
roast<00:02:01.399> pork<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.790> course<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.690> here's<00:02:02.840> my<00:02:02.960> pork

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
roast pork of course so here's my pork

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.950 
roast pork of course so here's my pork
setting<00:02:03.649> my<00:02:04.550> next<00:02:04.970> choice<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.810> actually

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
setting my next choice is to actually

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.510 
setting my next choice is to actually
select<00:02:06.440> what<00:02:06.619> type<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.890> pork<00:02:07.250> I'm<00:02:07.340> going<00:02:07.460> to

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
select what type of pork I'm going to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.070 
select what type of pork I'm going to
put<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> oven<00:02:07.909> my<00:02:08.420> next<00:02:08.690> step<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:08.869> to

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
put in the oven my next step is to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.199 
put in the oven my next step is to
actually<00:02:09.229> choose<00:02:09.709> which<00:02:10.340> type<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.700> pork<00:02:11.060> I've

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
actually choose which type of pork I've

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.110 
actually choose which type of pork I've
got<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:12.050> actually<00:02:12.320> had<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.610> roast<00:02:13.610> cutlet

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
got and we actually had a roast cutlet

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.750 
got and we actually had a roast cutlet
on<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:15.019> bone<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.890> next<00:02:16.160> step<00:02:16.370> process<00:02:16.670> is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
on the bone so the next step process is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
on the bone so the next step process is
actually<00:02:16.940> till<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> oven<00:02:17.750> how<00:02:18.110> much<00:02:18.380> that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
actually till the oven how much that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.040 
actually till the oven how much that
pork<00:02:19.250> weighed<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.120> said<00:02:20.180> before<00:02:20.330> this

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
pork weighed and as I said before this

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.910 
pork weighed and as I said before this
is<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> 1.6<00:02:22.130> kilogram<00:02:23.019> roasted<00:02:24.019> pork<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.800> I've

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
is a 1.6 kilogram roasted pork so I've

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.740 
is a 1.6 kilogram roasted pork so I've
actually<00:02:25.010> now<00:02:25.370> educate<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.360> oven<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.630> even

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
actually now educate the oven or even

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.810 
actually now educate the oven or even
put<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.959> into<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.200> oven<00:02:27.290> 1.6<00:02:28.130> kilograms<00:02:28.580> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
put it into the oven 1.6 kilograms and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.580 
put it into the oven 1.6 kilograms and
our<00:02:29.480> next<00:02:29.810> step<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.170> actually<00:02:30.230> go<00:02:30.500> and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
our next step is to actually go and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
our next step is to actually go and
individually<00:02:31.220> adjust<00:02:31.670> internally<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
individually adjust internally the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.440 
individually adjust internally the
overall<00:02:33.620> cooking<00:02:33.920> process<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:35.120> from<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
overall cooking process to one from the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.210 
overall cooking process to one from the
top<00:02:35.660> which<00:02:35.840> means<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.739> actually<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
top which means that we actually the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.800 
top which means that we actually the
oven<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.550> calibrated<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.150> go<00:02:38.330> at<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.510> certain

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
oven is calibrated to go at a certain

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.059 
oven is calibrated to go at a certain
level<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.260> now<00:02:39.410> we're<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> cook<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
level and now we're going to cook to the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.460 
level and now we're going to cook to the
high<00:02:40.220> level<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:41.060> I've<00:02:41.180> now<00:02:41.330> chosen<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:42.319> from

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
high level so I've now chosen one from

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.620 
high level so I've now chosen one from
the<00:02:42.650> top<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.370> individual<00:02:44.090> settings<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the top in my individual settings and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.860 
the top in my individual settings and
from<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.799> my<00:02:46.220> next<00:02:46.549> step<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.329> just<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.630> press

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
from there my next step is just to press

big advantage to this process is all of

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.830 
big advantage to this process is all of
the<00:04:21.060> splattering<00:04:21.389> that's<00:04:21.599> been<00:04:21.720> happening

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.620 
need now is a bit of flour I'm going to
make<00:04:56.789> our<00:04:56.970> roux<00:04:57.180> in<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.449> bottom<00:04:59.630> fantastic

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
make our roux in the bottom fantastic

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.629 
make our roux in the bottom fantastic
gravy<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.229> we<00:05:01.680> have<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.830> dual<00:05:02.070> function<00:05:02.490> here

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
gravy so we have a dual function here

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.490 
gravy so we have a dual function here
we're<00:05:02.729> making<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.090> gravy<00:05:03.360> but<00:05:04.050> also<00:05:04.199> we're

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
we're making a gravy but also we're

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.870 
we're making a gravy but also we're
actually<00:05:04.830> cleaning<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.310> bottom<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.699> dish

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
actually cleaning the bottom of the dish

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.969 
actually cleaning the bottom of the dish
so<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.570> result<00:05:06.900> is<00:05:07.050> washing<00:05:07.470> up<00:05:07.590> time<00:05:07.830> is

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
so the result is washing up time is

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.100 
so the result is washing up time is
going<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.190> be<00:05:08.280> reduced<00:05:08.580> as<00:05:08.789> well<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.300> there's<00:05:10.080> a

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
going to be reduced as well so there's a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.740 
going to be reduced as well so there's a
lot<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.349> advantages<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:11.099> this<00:05:12.090> automatic

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
lot of advantages to this automatic

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.000 
lot of advantages to this automatic
cooking<00:05:13.020> program<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.590> we<00:05:13.680> have<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:13.919> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
cooking program that we have on the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.550 
cooking program that we have on the
Siemens<00:05:14.370> oven<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:15.419> there<00:05:15.630> we<00:05:15.750> go<00:05:15.900> that's<00:05:16.470> the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
Siemens oven so there we go that's the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.320 
Siemens oven so there we go that's the
completion<00:05:17.070> of<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.190> cooking<00:05:17.400> process<00:05:17.460> what<00:05:18.300> I
