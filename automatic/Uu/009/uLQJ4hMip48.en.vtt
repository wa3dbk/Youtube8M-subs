 I consider myself a patient boxer 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.030
 a disciplined boxer is probably 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.030
 helps the rest show in the ring 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.520

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.190
 translit 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.560
 I started studying 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.289
 generally after 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.169
 numbers and from there 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.710
 I just 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.470
 the saddle tank itself is broken 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.350

 if a person 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.960
