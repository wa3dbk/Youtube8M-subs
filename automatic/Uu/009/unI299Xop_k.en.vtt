this is my rendition of rocket stove
heater<00:00:09.580> mine<00:00:10.580> is<00:00:10.849> going<00:00:11.030> to<00:00:11.090> have<00:00:12.039> three<00:00:13.039> main

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
heater mine is going to have three main

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.429 
heater mine is going to have three main
components<00:00:16.240> first<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:17.480> have<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:17.840> feed<00:00:18.080> tube

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
components first we have the feed tube

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.649 
components first we have the feed tube
and<00:00:19.279> I<00:00:19.369> put<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.609> a<00:00:20.050> movable<00:00:22.329> function<00:00:23.329> in<00:00:23.449> there

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:23.659 
and I put a a movable function in there

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.069 
and I put a a movable function in there
for<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:23.990> damper<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:26.509> you<00:00:26.659> can<00:00:26.779> see<00:00:26.989> you'll

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
for the damper and you can see you'll

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.890 
for the damper and you can see you'll
about<00:00:27.519> that's<00:00:28.519> gonna<00:00:28.759> go<00:00:29.029> on<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.419> three<00:00:29.659> soup

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
about that's gonna go on the three soup

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.830 
about that's gonna go on the three soup
cans<00:00:30.230> with<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.710> lid<00:00:30.859> on<00:00:30.890> top<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.579> it's<00:00:32.570> got<00:00:32.720> it

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
cans with the lid on top and it's got it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.650 
cans with the lid on top and it's got it
if<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.050> notice<00:00:33.350> there's<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.590> notch<00:00:33.800> out<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:35.510> I

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
if you notice there's a notch out and I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.990 
if you notice there's a notch out and I
will<00:00:35.810> go<00:00:35.989> in<00:00:37.240> this<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.190> can<00:00:40.340> see<00:00:40.580> in<00:00:40.820> the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
will go in this and you can see in the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.580 
will go in this and you can see in the
top<00:00:42.370> with<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.750> damper<00:00:45.230> will<00:00:45.440> move

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
top with that and the damper will move

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.560 
top with that and the damper will move
up<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:45.980> down<00:00:46.130> so<00:00:48.610> it'll<00:00:49.610> line<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:50.000> like<00:00:50.180> that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
up and down so it'll line up like that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.860 
up and down so it'll line up like that
this<00:00:50.960> is<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.260> main<00:00:51.440> burn<00:00:51.770> chamber<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:53.570> this

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
this is the main burn chamber so this

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:04.149 
this is the main burn chamber so this
part<00:00:54.700> goes<00:00:55.700> into<00:01:00.070> look<00:01:01.070> down<00:01:01.280> into<00:01:01.640> here<00:01:03.159> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
part goes into look down into here and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.300 
part goes into look down into here and
then<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:04.850> gets<00:01:05.089> put<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:05.990> here<00:01:06.939> like<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.210> and

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
then this gets put in here like that and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.490 
then this gets put in here like that and
then<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.520> fill<00:01:10.790> up<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.150> county<00:01:11.600> with<00:01:12.320> either

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
then we fill up the county with either

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.670 
then we fill up the county with either
vermiculite<00:01:13.330> sawdust<00:01:14.330> wet<00:01:15.170> saw<00:01:15.470> dust<00:01:16.360> ashes

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
vermiculite sawdust wet saw dust ashes

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.780 
vermiculite sawdust wet saw dust ashes

and you playing overtalk and Alex sticks

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.310 
and you playing overtalk and Alex sticks
into<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.740> can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:14.320> it's

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
into this there so as you can see it's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
into this there so as you can see it's
actually<00:02:15.770> gonna<00:02:15.950> be<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.190> cow<00:02:17.740> here

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.070 

so<00:02:22.340> with<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.760> being<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.330> there<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.600> can't<00:02:23.900> put

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
so with this being in there I can't put

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.380 
so with this being in there I can't put
it<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.470> now

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
it in right now

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.640 
it in right now
that's<00:02:26.390> being<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.140> smoke<00:02:27.440> will

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that's being in there the smoke will

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.010 
that's being in there the smoke will
come<00:02:27.830> up<00:02:28.040> they'll<00:02:29.030> hit<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.360> top<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.690> this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
come up they'll hit the top of this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.770 
come up they'll hit the top of this
it'll<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.070> forced<00:02:31.610> down<00:02:31.790> around<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.390> sides<00:02:32.570> of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
it'll be forced down around the sides of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.870 
it'll be forced down around the sides of
the<00:02:32.900> tube<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.470> then<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.220> should<00:02:34.610> come<00:02:34.640> out

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the tube and then it should come out

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.730 
the tube and then it should come out
here<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.390> no<00:02:35.600> smoke<00:02:35.900> that's<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> whole<00:02:36.709> idea

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
here with no smoke that's the whole idea

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.830 
here with no smoke that's the whole idea
about<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.459> plus<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.420> want<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.690> put

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
about it plus if you want to put

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.010 
about it plus if you want to put
something<00:02:39.050> on<00:02:39.260> top<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.680> cook<00:02:39.890> yeah<00:02:40.610> or<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
something on top to cook yeah or it

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.020 
something on top to cook yeah or it
might<00:02:42.200> not<00:02:42.230> work<00:02:42.350> with<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.950> might<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:43.340> try

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
might not work with it I might just try

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.500 
might not work with it I might just try
it<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.270> this

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it like this

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.400 
it like this
Oh<00:02:44.800> next<00:02:45.800> step<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:48.580> put<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> nozzle<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:51.280> and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
Oh next step is to put the nozzle in and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.229 
Oh next step is to put the nozzle in and
fill<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.590> concrete<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.970> as<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.270> can<00:02:56.390> see

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
fill it with concrete so as you can see

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.890 
fill it with concrete so as you can see
it's<00:02:59.239> my<00:02:59.390> little<00:02:59.690> damper<00:03:01.390> that's<00:03:02.390> gonna<00:03:02.540> sit

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
it's my little damper that's gonna sit

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.960 
it's my little damper that's gonna sit
in<00:03:03.020> here<00:03:03.050> as<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.440> notice<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:03.860> got<00:03:04.010> there<00:03:04.250> it's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
in here as you notice I got there it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.650 
in here as you notice I got there it's
about<00:03:06.040> 1/3<00:03:07.040> lower<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.090> not<00:03:08.239> right<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.570> the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
about 1/3 lower it's not right in the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
about 1/3 lower it's not right in the
center<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.799> air<00:03:09.980> will<00:03:10.190> rush<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.640> here

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
center so the air will rush in here

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.720 
center so the air will rush in here
theoretically<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.860> air<00:03:13.040> will<00:03:13.190> come<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.549> here

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
theoretically the air will come in here

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.009 
theoretically the air will come in here
the<00:03:13.850> fire<00:03:14.090> will<00:03:14.330> be<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.690> should<00:03:17.900> be

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the fire will be here and you should be

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.020 
the fire will be here and you should be
able<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.230> dampen<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.860> from<00:03:19.220> here<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.640> adjust

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
able to dampen it from here to adjust

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.199 
able to dampen it from here to adjust
the<00:03:20.209> air<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.540> comes<00:03:20.690> from<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.010> out

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
the air that comes from here and out

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.910 
the air that comes from here and out
that's<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.480> idea

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
that's the idea

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.350 
that's the idea
burn<00:03:24.920> chamber<00:03:25.580> assembled<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:29.410> there<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.530> go

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
burn chamber assembled and there you go

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.810 
burn chamber assembled and there you go
the<00:03:32.360> tube<00:03:32.600> runs<00:03:32.870> in<00:03:33.110> through<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:34.549> know<00:03:34.670> it's

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
the tube runs in through you know it's

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.320 
the tube runs in through you know it's
done

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
done

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.870 
done
now<00:03:35.840> I'm<00:03:35.959> gonna<00:03:36.110> fill<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.650> cavity<00:03:36.950> up<00:03:37.340> with

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
now I'm gonna fill this cavity up with

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.750 
now I'm gonna fill this cavity up with
some<00:03:38.060> concrete<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.920> I've<00:03:40.070> been<00:03:40.310> under<00:03:40.640> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
some concrete and I've been under the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.380 
some concrete and I've been under the
bottom<00:03:41.739> there's<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.890> layer<00:03:43.160> from<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.060> bottom

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
bottom there's a layer from the bottom

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.590 
bottom there's a layer from the bottom
of<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:44.780> will<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.170> concrete
