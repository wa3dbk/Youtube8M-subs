to activate the four-wheel drive system

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
to activate the four-wheel drive system
we<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> Jeep<00:00:38.129> active<00:00:38.489> drive<00:00:38.700> low<00:00:38.940> pull

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
attraction will get all the power and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.729 
attraction will get all the power and
overcome<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.860> sport<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.649> have

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
overcome what about sport and we have

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
overcome what about sport and we have
two<00:00:52.949> four-cylinder<00:00:53.760> options<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.690> the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:38.130 
grosgrain suspension all independence we
get<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.090> fun<00:01:23.390> bounce

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.150 

let's<00:01:38.590> take<00:01:38.770> us<00:01:38.920> into<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.470> main<00:01:41.590> attraction

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
let's take us into the main attraction

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.980 
let's take us into the main attraction
this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.610> large<00:01:43.060> traction<00:01:43.600> Hill<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:43.870> is

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
this is the large traction Hill this is

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.710 
this is the large traction Hill this is
a<00:01:44.020> 35<00:01:44.470> degree<00:01:44.650> climb<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.370> will<00:01:45.760> take<00:01:45.910> us<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.240> 18

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
a 35 degree climb I will take us up 18

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.830 
a 35 degree climb I will take us up 18
feet<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.230> drop<00:01:47.530> us<00:01:47.710> back<00:01:47.890> down<00:01:48.360> 35<00:01:49.360> degrees<00:01:49.690> as

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
feet and drop us back down 35 degrees as

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.700 
feet and drop us back down 35 degrees as
well<00:01:50.370> so<00:01:51.370> we<00:01:51.430> get<00:01:51.550> 180<00:01:52.060> horsepower<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.810> 175

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
well so we get 180 horsepower and 175

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.490 
well so we get 180 horsepower and 175
foot-pounds<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.340> torque<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:54.730> the<00:01:54.820> vehicle

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
foot-pounds of torque with the vehicle

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:08.059 
foot-pounds of torque with the vehicle
and<00:01:56.500> here<00:01:57.040> we<00:01:57.130> go

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.449 

renegade<00:02:09.069> keeping<00:02:09.429> up<00:02:09.550> with<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> regulars

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
renegade keeping up with the regulars

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.800 
renegade keeping up with the regulars
that's<00:02:12.459> electronic<00:02:12.910> kill<00:02:13.209> descent

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
that's electronic kill descent

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.420 
that's electronic kill descent
