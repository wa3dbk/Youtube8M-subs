Tomatoes<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> easiest<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.039> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Tomatoes the easiest thing to do is to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.810 
Tomatoes the easiest thing to do is to
really<00:00:30.140> just<00:00:31.140> cut<00:00:31.380> back<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> plants<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
really just cut back the plants that you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
really just cut back the plants that you
don't<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.870> start<00:00:34.170> by<00:00:34.410> looking<00:00:34.590> at

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
don't want and you start by looking at

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.630 
don't want and you start by looking at
what<00:00:35.250> plan<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> tallest<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.079> also<00:00:37.680> what

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
what plan is the tallest and also what

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
what plan is the tallest and also what
stem<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.140> sturdiest<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
stem is the sturdiest so it's kind of a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
stem is the sturdiest so it's kind of a
combination<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:42.120> both<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:44.510> they're<00:00:45.510> kind

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
combination of both in here they're kind

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
combination of both in here they're kind
of<00:00:45.930> tight<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> cut<00:00:47.070> the
