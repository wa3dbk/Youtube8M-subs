00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.400
 we 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 Yes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 he 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.529
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.070
 new tutorial today we get 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.220
 finds 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 to show you how to disable 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.240
 control of user accounts 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.890
 when windows for example desire 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.690
 control when you install a 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.489
 software you usually have a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.970
 warning that appears on your 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.050
 office and you have to authorize the 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.690
 program to set up or allow 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.830
 windows to change settings 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.510
 important in the cause palace of 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.400
 configuration in the registry by 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.449
 example so these are often 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.100
 warnings that slow down 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.040
 computers often at the small 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.420
 configurations because the the box 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.540
 dialogue that asks permission is 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.430
 often long to load or simply 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.910
 when you are a user 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.729
 experienced you do not have there utility 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.250
 or use this warning that 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.149
 will simply slow down the launch of the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 software to install 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.960
 so how to disable it so that's 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.210
 very simple you will come under 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.410
 windows seven windows 8 in the panel 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.789
 of configuration so here I'm doing a 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.660
 right-click not our configuration 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.500
 then you go into this system and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.780
 security and in maintenance center 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.869
 you find change the settings of 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.520
 control of user accounts up 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.289
 so see here there are several levels 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.990
 so by default you are notified when 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.119
 applications will settle on 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.619
 your computer 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.179
 and so I want to come the BC so 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.740
 you can increase it but this is 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.530
 not what we want unless you are a 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.990
 user who really wants to do 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.550
 be careful not to take any viruses or 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.929
 to do anything on your 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.110
 computer so I'm going down 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.580
 here for example like that when I have 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.380
 installed software I am warned 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.990
 nevertheless when I was editing 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.190
 features under windows I do not have 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.950
 need because I am warning 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 pretty good at that level you can 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 also everything down is never 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.360
 to notify me is here you will never have the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.260
 small logo displayed with the warning 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.470
 of windows so I leave it by 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.599
 defect then you just so if 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.230
 you are here for example to click on 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.260
 okay 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.940
 with the employees the authorization still 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 again so one last time before 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.349
 disabling and your computer 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.230
 now no longer subject to control 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.280
 user accounts so well 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.629
 obviously to perform this 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.190
 operation you must be be 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.200
 administrator because only the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.080
 users 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.420
 admin can change this setting to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.099
 using your password 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.620
 so that was it for this little 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.560
 very fast tutorial I hope it will 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.000
 will have served and if you do not have any 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.769
 questions and that's all in the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.359
 comments me I say thank you
