00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 good people I am a cane and introducing myself 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.639
 with a new video on the subject of my 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.679
 ideas for the game of the wwf 214 for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.429
 this I bring two rookie friends with the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.190
 I'm good with Loquendo Loquendo 316 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.310
 your ideas how about youtube friends I am 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.279
 this nicole 316 of stories and today I come to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 participate in the video of pastón and 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.400
 taking advantage of that I'm in a video of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 this great what whole I would like to give 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.789
 thanks for helping me with the channel 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 today I come to talk to you about what I 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.380
 I want to appear the bosca 14 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.300
 well I would like there to be more 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 stories for the attitude mode 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 if it appears that of course 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.809
 they appeared estoril in as of ricky 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 Anglo looks for rock because they too 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.039
 have contributed in the wwdc 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.469
 and if you do not put it in this game I think 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 lehman new products would already 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.789
 I would not like it because this mode has 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 been a success I would also like to be 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.570
 they put history into play but 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.699
 young talent that is very difficult to what 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 do because most people 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.589
 they support young talent in the w 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 of the few we resisted seen the talent 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.670
 young in a major fight or in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 money in the bank and this year also 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 I would like you to add wrestlers 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 of the young person exists with the two titles that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.159
 includes the show I do not see much n exists 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 but I would like you to put these 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.910
 wrestlers good because they are also 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 young talents need to learn 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.150
 a lot in that company 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.330
 I would like you to add struggles that do not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 have been in the wwp2 the fight 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 lumberjacks that of the three stages of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 hell and many more and finally what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.539
 what I would like more would be to leave the ww 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.250
 put the show of the w with the couriers 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.110
 that there's always how he went to brooke 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.330
 sheen active and that the advisor is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 especially the record fights in the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.289
 blood fall into the ring that does not get out 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 like the other fires I would like 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.679
 also that obviously the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.840
 interventions in the struggles are good 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.000
 that there are good graphics and those things 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 I would like to see differences remain 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.310
 in wwdc that I liked that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.440
 it's very realistic, well, thank you

 I agree with you this 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.520

 get up to the wwp2 14 one more 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.850
 objects for the aei and they are born as tables and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.130
 stairs because I got tired of it just 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.320
 there are chairs and more the two of you go back to 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.470
 entries in the elimination chamber 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.660
 because it makes me leave without input 4 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.850
 that the money struggles in the bank the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.640
 universe found but a one of raul and 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.380
 another one of smart road 5 is from light to three 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.140
 stages of hell and that we 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.270

 your types of struggle that you can get out of 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.689
