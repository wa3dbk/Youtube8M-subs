00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.779
 May little ponni girls from equestria game 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:14.019
 friendship 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:17.499
 the science of magic and perhaps we will not 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.720
 the rehearsal is no going to be like a princess 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.319
 celestia taught me what to study 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.449
 an object 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.159
 need to watch him into action let 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.769
 others rummage in old books 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.589
 I'd rather roll up my sleeves and do everything 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.470
 with your hoof hands 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:35.440
 I understand your idea and but where is it 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.790
 our musical rehearsal I want to understand 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.500
 how are your who 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.390
 why do you have a simple tails and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.550
 wings when you play and what have you got 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.780
 your tools 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.510
 maybe we better leave it as it is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's fun just play and me not even 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 will notice 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:07.020
 so after long experiments i 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.759
 came to a clear conclusion I have no idea 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.759
 I have how magic works
