gritty<00:02:18.360> coarse<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:20.310> found<00:02:20.610> out<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.910> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
gritty coarse and I found out that you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.540 
gritty coarse and I found out that you
can<00:02:21.209> make<00:02:21.270> polenta<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:22.110> semolina<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
can make polenta with semolina which is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.910 
can make polenta with semolina which is
a<00:02:23.580> wheat<00:02:23.850> based<00:02:24.090> versus<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> corn<00:02:25.200> okay<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
a wheat based versus the corn okay and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.420 
a wheat based versus the corn okay and
it<00:02:26.040> gives<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.640> creamier<00:02:27.330> texture<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it gives a creamier texture to it so the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
it gives a creamier texture to it so the
