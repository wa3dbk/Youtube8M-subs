00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello I arrived so coach at 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 travel coach next to me before 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 that anoin so coach also bright 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.960
 to the coach we will talk today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 squat in the case of preparation 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.960
 physical for skiing the squat so 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.910
 main interest strengthening of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 lower limbs so basically 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 in front of the thighs behind the thighs 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.029
 quadriceps since January and the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 gluteal muscles which are the main ones 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.500
 muscles put into action in the ski the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.110
 main location and so the feet 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 basin width and more and becomes 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 difficult to implement because of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 affection and wider demands a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 some flexibility 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.230
 that's the best position 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.440
 important is that the body is at 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.840
 start straight so we'll do a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 movement of what to be free very simple 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 here is knee flexion at 90 Â° the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 advanced knee not exceeding the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.350
 tiptoe in flexed position the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 hip at knee height no lower 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.860
 the column and well upright chin raised 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.619
 look a little up and the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 arms are flexed slightly tense toward 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 forward to compensate for body weight 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.310
 who back down flexing 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.040
 the extension one goes up and one recovers 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 so for the squat the things not to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 make 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 firstly the position of the knees 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.009
 in position bent president antoine 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.810
 drawing reflection the affection is 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.799
 perfect knee well there for the tip 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.850
 what to avoid is that the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.579
 pressure knee goes forward it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 to proscribe too much tension at the level 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.520
 knees secondly same thing at 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.810
 knee level 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.399
 that's what we'll answer to call him 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.659
 the valgus so it's the genoa brawl 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.299
 Nazis in canvas it is not necessary that during 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.399
 the interruption knees either returning 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.140
 same thing the bad pressures 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.770
 can be imputed at the level of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 joint 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 so we keep the alignment between the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.520
 ankle knee and hip 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.049
 thirdly the importance of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.330
 column alignment with the port 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.050
 of head so asia canvas in the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.810
 bending top well sp 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.690
 and the natural curvature of the roommate 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.090
 ie the cervical spine here 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.320
 slightly their dose and it's a slight 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.510
 camber complexity here at the back level 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.130
 gold kyphosis room a little con carne and 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 here the natural arching lord at 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.350
 secondary this is a natural thing to 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 kept in this alignment the head 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.330
 here is a little game at the chin 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.220
 do not go down the chin inflection 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.110
 otherwise we risk creating tensions 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.270
 cervical level and especially allows 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 balance there for setting up the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.830
 squat in terms of training for the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.890
 preparations which according to your level to 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.390
 do it two to three times a week with 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.920
 or without material 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.380
 now you have all the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 tips and techniques to make 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.330
 so squat to you to play
