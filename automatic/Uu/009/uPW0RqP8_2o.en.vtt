I

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.400 
I
I<00:00:07.569> first<00:00:08.139> knew<00:00:08.469> heavy<00:00:08.950> hunter

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.570 

during<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.800> progress<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.120 

at<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:16.910> wood<00:00:17.060> in<00:00:17.240> today

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.230 

to<00:00:20.220> an<00:00:20.369> injury

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.909 

so<00:00:23.599> what<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:23.839> really<00:00:24.080> wanted<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.380> show<00:00:24.560> you<00:00:24.619> was

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
so what I really wanted to show you was

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.659 
so what I really wanted to show you was
this<00:00:25.160> jig<00:00:26.029> that<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:27.500> use<00:00:27.739> for<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.039> blade<00:00:28.279> cutting

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.210 

it's<00:00:31.669> a<00:00:31.730> pretty<00:00:31.910> simple<00:00:32.390> little<00:00:32.480> wood<00:00:33.379> angle<00:00:33.980> I

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
it's a pretty simple little wood angle I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.990 
it's a pretty simple little wood angle I
put<00:00:35.090> a

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
put a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.230 
put a
couple<00:00:37.750> holes<00:00:37.930> in<00:00:38.140> it

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
couple holes in it

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.170 
couple holes in it
as<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.630> can<00:00:39.720> see<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.470> clamps

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.869 

it's<00:00:43.480> pretty<00:00:43.750> amazing<00:00:44.079> how<00:00:44.379> how<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.250> works<00:00:45.550> I

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
it's pretty amazing how how this works I

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's pretty amazing how how this works I
just<00:00:46.480> put<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> little<00:00:47.530> groove<00:00:47.920> in<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.190> top<00:00:48.430> fit

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
just put a little groove in the top fit

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.819 
just put a little groove in the top fit
my<00:00:49.329> little<00:00:49.449> clamps<00:00:49.930> clamps<00:00:50.500> are<00:00:50.620> really

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
my little clamps clamps are really

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.470 
my little clamps clamps are really
inexpensive<00:00:51.160> at<00:00:51.550> Lowe's<00:00:51.730> they're<00:00:51.940> only<00:00:52.239> vote

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
inexpensive at Lowe's they're only vote

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.619 
inexpensive at Lowe's they're only vote
and<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.379> can<00:00:53.440> see<00:00:53.739> how<00:00:53.980> I<00:00:54.309> just<00:00:54.850> clamp<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.480> onto

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
and you can see how I just clamp it onto

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.340 
and you can see how I just clamp it onto
the<00:00:55.870> side<00:00:56.110> of<00:00:56.140> my<00:00:56.440> wood

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the side of my wood

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.050 
the side of my wood
and<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.860> can<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.460> things<00:01:00.140> very<00:01:01.140> fast

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
and I can make these things very fast

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.050 
and I can make these things very fast
with<00:01:03.060> very<00:01:03.450> precise<00:01:03.930> angles<00:01:04.670> just<00:01:05.670> by<00:01:05.820> taking

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
with very precise angles just by taking

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.700 
with very precise angles just by taking
a<00:01:06.300> 2x4<00:01:07.850> cut<00:01:08.850> into<00:01:09.120> size<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.750> marked<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> degree<00:01:10.530> on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a 2x4 cut into size I marked a degree on

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060 
a 2x4 cut into size I marked a degree on
it<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.070> cut<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.120> angle<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> 20<00:01:13.890> degree

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it I cut the angle this is a 20 degree

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.310 
it I cut the angle this is a 20 degree
for<00:01:14.490> final<00:01:14.850> sharpening

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.920 

I<00:01:18.350> got<00:01:18.950> some<00:01:19.130> four<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.490> half<00:01:19.670> degree

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
I got some four and a half degree

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.830 
I got some four and a half degree
for<00:01:22.530> initial<00:01:22.710> grinding<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
for initial grinding and this one I just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.790 
for initial grinding and this one I just
did<00:01:25.140> yesterday<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> heavy<00:01:27.420> hunter<00:01:27.810> it's

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
did yesterday for the heavy hunter it's

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.460 
did yesterday for the heavy hunter it's
right<00:01:29.010> about<00:01:29.220> five<00:01:29.460> degrees<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:31.260> they're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
right about five degrees and they're

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.900 
right about five degrees and they're
pretty<00:01:31.680> simple<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.610> cut<00:01:32.760> out<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
pretty simple to make just cut out a

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.980 
pretty simple to make just cut out a
quick<00:01:33.650> two-by-four<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.730> my<00:01:36.000> angle<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.870> can

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
quick two-by-four I use my angle you can

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.270 
quick two-by-four I use my angle you can
do<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.200> by<00:01:37.350> hand<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.830> don't<00:01:37.980> have<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
do this by hand if you don't have one of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.130 
do this by hand if you don't have one of
these<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.900> by<00:01:39.900> marking<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.580> but<00:01:41.900> it's<00:01:42.900> really

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
these just by marking it but it's really

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.859 
these just by marking it but it's really
simple<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.650> cut<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.130> piece<00:01:44.340> out

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.310 

and<00:01:47.320> then<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:48.310> course<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.700> has<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.320> Andy

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
and then of course it has that Andy

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.880 
and then of course it has that Andy
little<00:01:51.869> angle<00:01:52.869> setting

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.030 

and<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.460> just<00:01:58.670> cut<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.350> on<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> angle<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:00.890> I

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and I just cut it on the angle that I

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.560 
and I just cut it on the angle that I
want<00:02:02.650> handy<00:02:03.650> little<00:02:03.770> tool<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.310> bought

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
want handy little tool that I bought

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.529 
want handy little tool that I bought
before<00:02:05.570> squaring<00:02:06.410> up<00:02:06.530> your<00:02:06.940> grinder<00:02:07.940> and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
before squaring up your grinder and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.660 
before squaring up your grinder and
working<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.320> angles<00:02:09.979> being<00:02:10.220> able<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.520> check

working on angles being able to check
angles<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.270> things<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.160> really

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
angles on things this is are really

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.720 
angles on things this is are really
inexpensive<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.540> mean<00:02:15.290> 20<00:02:15.680> bucks<00:02:15.920> or<00:02:16.160> less<00:02:16.490> I

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
inexpensive I mean 20 bucks or less I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.170 
inexpensive I mean 20 bucks or less I
think<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.330> paid<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.620> this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
think is what I paid for it but this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
think is what I paid for it but this
allows<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.420> check<00:02:21.350> angles<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.430> about

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
allows you to check angles on just about

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.449 
allows you to check angles on just about
anything<00:02:22.990> it's<00:02:23.990> come<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.200> pretty<00:02:24.530> handy<00:02:24.620> you

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
anything it's come in pretty handy you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.440 
anything it's come in pretty handy you
know<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.640> use<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.290> double<00:02:27.290> checking<00:02:27.560> my

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
know I use it for double checking my

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.430 
know I use it for double checking my
my<00:02:29.990> square

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
my square

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
over here I'm gonna see because it's got

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410 
over here I'm gonna see because it's got
magnets<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.940> actually<00:02:36.030> check

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
magnets on it you can actually check
