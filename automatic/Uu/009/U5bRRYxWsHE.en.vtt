video I showed you how to make Windows
if<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.250> needed<00:00:14.490> help<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.289> but<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.529> of

the complicated things is how do you
actually<00:00:18.869> fill<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
actually fill things in here and the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
actually fill things in here and the
fact<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> there's<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:22.859> many<00:00:23.310> different

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fact is there's actually many different

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.380 
fact is there's actually many different
ways<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
ways to do it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.200 
ways to do it
so<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> show<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.590> way

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
so I'm just going to show you one way

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
so I'm just going to show you one way
first<00:00:27.210> off<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.560> create

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
first off I'm going to want to create

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.220 
first off I'm going to want to create
the<00:00:29.189> walls<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.699> house<00:00:29.960> after<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> house

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the walls for the house after the house

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.520 
the walls for the house after the house
is<00:00:31.859> created<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:35.210> let's<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.329> ahead<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.989> put

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
is created so let's go ahead and put

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
is created so let's go ahead and put
four<00:00:38.510> parenthesis<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:42.210> we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
four parenthesis and we're going to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.459 
four parenthesis and we're going to
create<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.260> script<00:00:43.770> variable<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.430> bar<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.469> equals

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
create a script variable I bar I equals

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.000 
create a script variable I bar I equals
zero<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.450> say<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.289> variable

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
zero and let's say we want this variable

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
zero and let's say we want this variable
to<00:00:50.039> increase<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.600> five<00:00:51.870> times<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.800> we'll

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to increase on all five times so we'll

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
to increase on all five times so we'll
say<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> less<00:00:54.120> than<00:00:54.329> five<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> basically<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
say I is less than five so basically it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
say I is less than five so basically it
will<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.789> whatever<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.390> repeat<00:00:57.989> five

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
will have whatever this is repeat five

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.250 
will have whatever this is repeat five
times<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.449> then<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.629> forgot<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
times and then I forgot this is a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.609 
times and then I forgot this is a
semicolon<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:04.129> lastly<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.820> need<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> say

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
semicolon and then lastly we need to say

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.780 
semicolon and then lastly we need to say
what's<00:01:07.619> happening<00:01:08.010> each<00:01:08.100> time<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
what's happening each time and I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
what's happening each time and I
basically<00:01:09.240> am<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> increase<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.680> each

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
basically am going to increase it each

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.000 
basically am going to increase it each
time<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> basically<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.619> doing<00:01:13.860> here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
time so basically all we're doing here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.700 
time so basically all we're doing here
is<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.250> creating<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:15.060> loop<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is we're creating a for loop where the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
is we're creating a for loop where the
support<00:01:16.979> loop<00:01:17.220> based<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
support loop based on this it's going to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.920 
support loop based on this it's going to
repeat<00:01:19.680> five<00:01:19.890> times<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.509> need<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> tell<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
repeat five times so we need to tell it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.100 
repeat five times so we need to tell it
what<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> first<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.810> want

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
what to do in here so first off you want

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
what to do in here so first off you want
to<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> create<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:26.009> image<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:28.700> I'm<00:01:29.700> gonna

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to have it create an image and I'm gonna

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.420 
to have it create an image and I'm gonna
have<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> find<00:01:30.570> an<00:01:30.869> image<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.310> gonna

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
have it find an image for me I'm gonna

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.630 
have it find an image for me I'm gonna
grab<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> wood<00:01:33.030> block<00:01:34.430> close<00:01:35.430> my

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
grab this wood block close my

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
grab this wood block close my
parenthesis<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.479> comma<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.900> we

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
parenthesis good and then comma and we

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.399 
parenthesis good and then comma and we
need<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> x<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> y<00:01:40.890> position<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> X<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:43.110> say

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
need the x and y position so X will say

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
need the x and y position so X will say
X<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.979> 100<00:01:44.610> comma<00:01:45.149> Y<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.630> 100<00:01:47.000> well<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.299> gives

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
X is 100 comma Y is 100 well that gives

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.690 
X is 100 comma Y is 100 well that gives
me<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.840> small<00:01:49.799> stuff<00:01:51.049> that's<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> large

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
me this small stuff that's kind of large

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.630 
me this small stuff that's kind of large
and<00:01:53.720> secondly<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.890> changing<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and secondly it's not changing because I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170 
and secondly it's not changing because I
haven't<00:01:56.909> used<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.450> eye<00:01:57.890> at<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.729> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
haven't used this eye at all in here to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
haven't used this eye at all in here to
change<00:02:01.790> yeah<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.060> change<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:04.469> position<00:02:05.540> so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
change yeah to change the position so

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
change yeah to change the position so
let's<00:02:06.570> say<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> wanted<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> position<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
let's say I wanted the position to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.369 
let's say I wanted the position to
change<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> x-direction

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
change in the x-direction

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.860 
change in the x-direction
so<00:02:10.590> maybe<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.400> X

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so maybe I want it to be X

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.410 
so maybe I want it to be X
so<00:02:13.870> I'll<00:02:13.959> say<00:02:14.580> 100<00:02:15.580> plus<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.209> times<00:02:18.060> let's<00:02:19.060> say<00:02:19.390> I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
so I'll say 100 plus I times let's say I

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.710 
so I'll say 100 plus I times let's say I
want<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.930> be<00:02:20.020> 100

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
want it to be 100

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.479 
want it to be 100
well<00:02:22.720> now<00:02:22.870> I'm<00:02:23.020> getting<00:02:23.260> somewhere<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.800> so

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
well now I'm getting somewhere right so

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.559 
well now I'm getting somewhere right so
now<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.810> has<00:02:25.840> started<00:02:26.470> moving<00:02:27.090> over<00:02:28.090> now

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
now it has started moving over now

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.510 
now it has started moving over now
here's<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> tricky<00:02:29.170> part<00:02:29.410> you're<00:02:30.250> gonna<00:02:30.370> have

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
here's the tricky part you're gonna have

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.400 
here's the tricky part you're gonna have
to<00:02:30.610> figure<00:02:30.819> out<00:02:30.900> where<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.080> want<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.350> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
to figure out where do you want it to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.440 
to figure out where do you want it to
start<00:02:32.680> no<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.850> adjust<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.330> like

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
start no you can just adjust it like

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.729 
start no you can just adjust it like
that<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:36.069> can<00:02:36.400> also<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.380> also<00:02:38.530> change

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
that you can also you can also change

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.140 
that you can also you can also change
the<00:02:38.860> size<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:39.489> you're<00:02:39.610> thinking<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.120> a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the size if you're thinking this is a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.290 
the size if you're thinking this is a
weird<00:02:40.420> wall<00:02:40.959> maybe<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.440> want<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:42.300> bigger

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
weird wall maybe I want it to be bigger

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.370 
weird wall maybe I want it to be bigger
there<00:02:43.599> actually<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:45.130> make<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> bigger<00:02:45.640> or

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
there actually you can make it bigger or

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.250 
there actually you can make it bigger or
actually<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.560> make<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:48.030> larger<00:02:49.049> smaller

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
actually if you make it larger smaller

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.070 
actually if you make it larger smaller
let's<00:02:50.410> try<00:02:50.530> smaller<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.430> instead<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.000> being

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
let's try smaller so instead of it being

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.520 
let's try smaller so instead of it being
the<00:02:53.080> size<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.560> let's<00:02:53.830> make<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.130> ten<00:02:54.340> by<00:02:54.549> ten

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the size it is let's make it ten by ten

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.020 
the size it is let's make it ten by ten
yeah<00:02:56.530> well<00:02:56.830> maybe<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.069> too<00:02:57.400> small<00:02:57.700> how

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
yeah well maybe that's too small how

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.309 
yeah well maybe that's too small how
about<00:02:58.290> 50<00:02:59.290> by<00:02:59.410> 50<00:03:00.600> well<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.750> think<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.080> looks<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
about 50 by 50 well I think that looks a

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.350 
about 50 by 50 well I think that looks a
little<00:03:02.440> bit<00:03:02.620> better<00:03:02.769> but<00:03:03.220> now<00:03:03.430> there's<00:03:04.030> spread

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
little bit better but now there's spread

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.440 
little bit better but now there's spread
out<00:03:04.480> too<00:03:04.750> much<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:05.769> saying<00:03:06.010> that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
out too much because I'm saying that

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.960 
out too much because I'm saying that
here<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.810> increase<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:09.130> by<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> hundred<00:03:09.850> each

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
here to increase it by a hundred each

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.440 
here to increase it by a hundred each
time

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
time

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.000 
time
that's<00:03:10.750> our<00:03:10.870> 50<00:03:11.290> wide<00:03:11.530> let's<00:03:12.130> make<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.340> 50<00:03:14.010> so

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
that's our 50 wide let's make it 50 so

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.090 
that's our 50 wide let's make it 50 so
now<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:16.230> need<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.380> change<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.739> Y<00:03:17.890> position

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
now I need to change the Y position

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.250 
now I need to change the Y position
because<00:03:18.790> right<00:03:19.030> now<00:03:19.180> they're<00:03:19.450> not<00:03:19.480> starting

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
because right now they're not starting

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.289 
because right now they're not starting
far<00:03:20.500> enough<00:03:20.650> down<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.489> let's<00:03:21.670> change<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.150> Y

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
far enough down so let's change the Y

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.840 
far enough down so let's change the Y
position<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.200> let's<00:03:23.980> go<00:03:24.160> down<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> little<00:03:24.670> bit

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
position to let's go down a little bit

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.690 
position to let's go down a little bit
150<00:03:25.650> too<00:03:26.650> much<00:03:26.859> let<00:03:27.340> me<00:03:27.370> adjust<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:29.310> okay<00:03:30.310> so

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
150 too much let me adjust it okay so

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.590 
150 too much let me adjust it okay so
now<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:31.000> getting<00:03:31.239> somewhere

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
now I'm getting somewhere

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.009 
now I'm getting somewhere
the<00:03:32.380> next<00:03:32.650> thing<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.780> don't<00:03:34.780> know<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:34.930> you

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the next thing is I don't know if you

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.560 
the next thing is I don't know if you
notice<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.070> not<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.180> filling<00:03:37.480> the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
notice this is not really filling the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.830 
notice this is not really filling the
house<00:03:37.720> up<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.760> problem<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.180> if<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.540> change

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
house up and the problem is if I change

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.670 
house up and the problem is if I change
this<00:03:42.120> that's<00:03:43.120> great<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.900> kind<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.170> fills<00:03:44.500> in

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
this that's great it kind of fills in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.550 
this that's great it kind of fills in
the<00:03:44.739> one<00:03:44.890> on<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.070> end<00:03:45.250> which<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.670> weird<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the one on the end which is weird what I

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.680 
the one on the end which is weird what I
may<00:03:47.829> want<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.160> do<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.910> actually<00:03:49.120> make<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.630> a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
may want to do is actually make that a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.400 
may want to do is actually make that a
variable<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> instead<00:03:52.420> of<00:03:52.480> saying<00:03:52.780> 50<00:03:53.260> cuz

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
variable so instead of saying 50 cuz

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.949 
variable so instead of saying 50 cuz
basically<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.950> need<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.190> change<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.060> that

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
basically I need to change this so that

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.349 
basically I need to change this so that
it<00:03:56.440> matches<00:03:56.739> beats<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.329> to

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
it matches beats so I'm just going to

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.470 
it matches beats so I'm just going to
put<00:03:58.600> more<00:04:00.000> I'm<00:04:01.000> gonna<00:04:01.150> call<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.480> with<00:04:03.480> more

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
put more I'm gonna call it with more

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.770 
put more I'm gonna call it with more
with<00:04:04.810> I'll<00:04:05.590> call<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.250> W<00:04:06.519> for<00:04:06.850> our<00:04:06.940> W<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.420> equal

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
with I'll call it W for our W is equal

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.539 
with I'll call it W for our W is equal
to<00:04:08.019> 50<00:04:08.590> because<00:04:08.980> we're<00:04:09.069> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> start<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.489> at

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
to 50 because we're going to start it at

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.830 
to 50 because we're going to start it at
50<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:11.230> I'm<00:04:11.769> gonna<00:04:11.859> change<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.579> W<00:04:13.150> just<00:04:13.690> a

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
50 and I'm gonna change this to W just a

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.740 
50 and I'm gonna change this to W just a
W<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.829> W<00:04:15.269> now<00:04:16.269> here's<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.630> great

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
W and this to W now here's the great

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.279 
W and this to W now here's the great
part<00:04:16.840> if<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.500> adjust<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:19.840> will<00:04:19.959> change

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
part if I adjust this it will change

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.740 
part if I adjust this it will change
everything<00:04:21.220> at<00:04:21.519> once<00:04:21.789> look<00:04:22.120> at<00:04:22.210> how<00:04:22.360> good<00:04:22.539> that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
everything at once look at how good that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.600 
everything at once look at how good that
is

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
is

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.220 
is
so<00:04:24.610> that

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
so that

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.450 
so that
kind<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.440> what<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.830> do<00:04:26.010> for<00:04:26.340> each

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
kind of what you have to do for each

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.250 
kind of what you have to do for each
line<00:04:26.880> now<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.480> could<00:04:27.720> do<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.140> each

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
line now you could do that with each

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.220 
line now you could do that with each
line<00:04:28.530> or<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.640> remember<00:04:30.000> in<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.690> challenge

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
line or if you remember in the challenge

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.730 
line or if you remember in the challenge
actually<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.980> nested<00:04:32.760> for-loops<00:04:33.740> video

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
actually in the nested for-loops video

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.890 
actually in the nested for-loops video
she<00:04:35.310> had<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.730> really<00:04:35.940> interesting<00:04:36.300> way<00:04:36.660> of

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
she had a really interesting way of

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.650 
she had a really interesting way of
using<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.290> for<00:04:37.560> loop<00:04:37.590> within<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.580> loop<00:04:38.730> so

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
using a for loop within a for loop so

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.300 
using a for loop within a for loop so
basically<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.320> could<00:04:40.410> do<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> same<00:04:40.860> thing

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
basically you could do the same thing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.630 
basically you could do the same thing
you<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.360> then<00:04:43.350> do<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.340> same<00:04:44.580> thing

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
you have this and then do the same thing

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.140 
you have this and then do the same thing
over<00:04:45.060> again<00:04:46.190> that's<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.460> tricky<00:04:47.730> part

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
over again that's the tricky part

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.820 
over again that's the tricky part
let's<00:04:48.480> see<00:04:48.630> if<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.780> can<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.050> or<00:04:49.920> VAR<00:04:51.830> sandy

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
let's see if I can do it or VAR sandy

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.920 
let's see if I can do it or VAR sandy
one<00:04:53.040> VAR<00:04:53.340> x<00:04:53.640> equals<00:04:54.180> 0<00:04:54.980> X<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.520> less<00:04:56.880> than<00:04:56.910> 5<00:04:57.420> I'm

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
one VAR x equals 0 X is less than 5 I'm

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.900 
one VAR x equals 0 X is less than 5 I'm
just<00:04:58.110> going<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.290> make<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> same<00:04:58.800> thing<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:01.980> X

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
just going to make the same thing and X

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.260 
just going to make the same thing and X
plus<00:05:05.420> now<00:05:06.420> in<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.960> bracket<00:05:07.820> I'm<00:05:08.820> gonna<00:05:09.000> tell

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
plus now in this bracket I'm gonna tell

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.890 
plus now in this bracket I'm gonna tell
it<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:10.460> change<00:05:11.570> variable<00:05:13.550> let's<00:05:14.550> say<00:05:14.900> we'll

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
it to change variable let's say we'll

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.080 
it to change variable let's say we'll
make<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.080> new<00:05:16.320> variable<00:05:16.500> we'll<00:05:17.370> call<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.880> new

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
make a new variable we'll call this new

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.070 
make a new variable we'll call this new
variable<00:05:19.880> well<00:05:20.880> I'll<00:05:21.180> just<00:05:21.330> keep<00:05:21.780> it<00:05:21.900> simple

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
variable well I'll just keep it simple

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.690 
variable well I'll just keep it simple
let's<00:05:22.380> just<00:05:22.560> make<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> image<00:05:23.100> first<00:05:23.660> image

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
let's just make the image first image

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.240 
let's just make the image first image
get<00:05:27.050> image<00:05:28.050> we're<00:05:28.410> gonna<00:05:28.530> use<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.770> same<00:05:29.010> one

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
get image we're gonna use the same one

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.820 
get image we're gonna use the same one
cute<00:05:29.850> /<00:05:30.150> would<00:05:30.900> belong<00:05:33.200> come<00:05:34.200> on

and then this time let's just try doing

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.780 
and then this time let's just try doing
60<00:05:38.550> plus<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.560> times<00:05:40.670> 60<00:05:41.670> oh<00:05:41.910> ma<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.700> don't<00:05:44.700> know

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
the Y this time and I forgot I have a

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.230 
the Y this time and I forgot I have a
different<00:05:50.160> variable<00:05:50.370> here<00:05:50.640> so<00:05:51.290> now<00:05:52.290> I<00:05:52.830> want<00:05:53.760> it

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
different variable here so now I want it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:04.300 
different variable here so now I want it
to<00:05:54.480> be<00:05:55.550> let's<00:05:56.550> say<00:05:57.320> 60<00:05:58.320> comma<00:05:59.480> X<00:06:02.090> plus<00:06:03.090> 3<00:06:03.630> times

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
to be let's say 60 comma X plus 3 times

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:16.670 
to be let's say 60 comma X plus 3 times
60<00:06:05.310> plus<00:06:07.280> 100<00:06:08.280> comma<00:06:13.220> like<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:14.600> okay<00:06:15.600> so<00:06:16.560> what

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
60 plus 100 comma like that okay so what

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.870 
60 plus 100 comma like that okay so what
I've<00:06:16.770> done<00:06:16.890> is<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.340> have<00:06:17.760> basically<00:06:18.420> created<00:06:19.880> 60

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
I've done is I have basically created 60

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.370 
I've done is I have basically created 60
is<00:06:21.150> my<00:06:22.430> starting<00:06:23.430> point<00:06:23.780> so<00:06:24.780> I'm<00:06:25.170> still

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
is my starting point so I'm still

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.000 
is my starting point so I'm still
starting<00:06:25.740> with<00:06:25.920> X<00:06:26.490> at<00:06:26.760> 60<00:06:27.210> and<00:06:27.420> then<00:06:28.350> my<00:06:28.740> Y

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
starting with X at 60 and then my Y

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.360 
starting with X at 60 and then my Y
position<00:06:29.610> I'm<00:06:29.760> having<00:06:30.060> an<00:06:30.150> increase<00:06:30.660> by<00:06:31.530> 60

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
position I'm having an increase by 60

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.460 
position I'm having an increase by 60
each<00:06:32.580> time

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
each time

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.110 
each time
you<00:06:33.890> know<00:06:33.980> I<00:06:34.010> could<00:06:34.280> do<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.460> same<00:06:34.640> thing<00:06:34.700> I<00:06:34.940> did

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
you know I could do the same thing I did

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.480 
you know I could do the same thing I did
up<00:06:35.210> here<00:06:35.290> and<00:06:36.290> that<00:06:36.650> would<00:06:36.770> be<00:06:36.920> a<00:06:36.950> little<00:06:37.370> more

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
up here and that would be a little more

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.150 
up here and that would be a little more
fancy<00:06:38.000> to<00:06:38.570> create<00:06:38.870> a<00:06:38.900> variable<00:06:39.380> to<00:06:39.800> then

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
fancy to create a variable to then

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.400 
fancy to create a variable to then
repeat<00:06:40.580> I<00:06:40.880> would<00:06:41.570> recommend<00:06:41.900> doing<00:06:42.050> that<00:06:42.260> so

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
repeat I would recommend doing that so

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.140 
repeat I would recommend doing that so
you<00:06:42.440> can<00:06:42.620> make<00:06:42.740> your<00:06:42.860> blocks<00:06:43.130> even<00:06:43.520> which<00:06:44.030> is

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
you can make your blocks even which is

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.630 
you can make your blocks even which is
kind<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.360> cool<00:06:44.510> anyway<00:06:45.230> hopefully<00:06:46.100> this<00:06:46.340> helps

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
kind of cool anyway hopefully this helps

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.490 
kind of cool anyway hopefully this helps
it's<00:06:47.000> just<00:06:47.330> a<00:06:47.420> couple<00:06:47.600> different<00:06:47.900> ideas<00:06:48.170> for

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
it's just a couple different ideas for

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.590 
it's just a couple different ideas for
you<00:06:49.010> to<00:06:49.370> use<00:06:49.790> for<00:06:49.820> filling<00:06:50.270> in<00:06:50.360> your<00:06:50.480> house

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
you to use for filling in your house
