00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300 
because I know we've gone over those two
quite<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> bit<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.629> video<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.140> far<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
quite a bit in this video so far the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.699 
quite a bit in this video so far the
younger<00:02:17.760> endless<00:02:18.239> which<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.930> destruction

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
younger endless which are destruction

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.180 
younger endless which are destruction
and<00:02:19.890> despair<00:02:20.370> delirium<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.510> desire

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
and despair delirium and desire

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
and despair delirium and desire
sometimes<00:02:23.450> just<00:02:24.450> don't<00:02:24.989> do<00:02:25.560> their<00:02:25.890> job

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
sometimes just don't do their job

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000 
sometimes just don't do their job
for<00:02:26.700> example<00:02:27.470> destruction<00:02:28.470> quit<00:02:28.769> his<00:02:28.980> job

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
for example destruction quit his job

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.699 
for example destruction quit his job
like<00:02:29.760> he<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.180> quit<00:02:30.569> now<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> event<00:02:31.620> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
like he just quit now in the event that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.800 
like he just quit now in the event that
an<00:02:31.890> endless<00:02:32.250> dies<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.819> universe<00:02:33.209> will<00:02:33.540> take

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
an endless dies the universe will take

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.009 
an endless dies the universe will take
that<00:02:34.049> endless<00:02:34.470> essence<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.569> replace<00:02:36.569> them

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
that endless essence and replace them

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.650 
that endless essence and replace them
with<00:02:37.260> another<00:02:37.319> aspect<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.370> their<00:02:38.700> being<00:02:39.030> but

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
with another aspect of their being but

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.390 
with another aspect of their being but
when<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.080> endless<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.799> becomes<00:02:41.129> inactive

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
when an endless just becomes inactive

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.020 
when an endless just becomes inactive
that<00:02:42.200> aspect<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.920> universe<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.610> becomes

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that aspect of the universe just becomes

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.110 
that aspect of the universe just becomes
chaotic<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.870> random<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.739> unpredictable<00:02:47.120> to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
chaotic and random and unpredictable to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.630 
chaotic and random and unpredictable to
counteract<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.470> universal<00:02:50.010> takes<00:02:50.280> some

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
counteract this the universal takes some

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.300 
counteract this the universal takes some
of<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.849> endless<00:02:51.180> essence<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.230> put<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> into

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
of that endless essence and put it into

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.330 
of that endless essence and put it into
a<00:02:53.340> mortal<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.690> saw<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.170> while<00:02:55.500> dream<00:02:55.860> was

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
a mortal we saw this while dream was

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.170 
a mortal we saw this while dream was
imprisoned

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
imprisoned

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.490 
imprisoned
now<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.720> also<00:02:57.840> worth<00:02:58.049> saying<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.349> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
now it's also worth saying that the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.619 
now it's also worth saying that the
endless<00:02:58.799> don't<00:02:59.129> just<00:02:59.430> define<00:02:59.940> their<00:03:00.390> own

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
endless don't just define their own

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.809 
endless don't just define their own
concept<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.470> also<00:03:01.829> work<00:03:01.980> for<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> opposite

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
concept they also work for the opposite

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.210 
concept they also work for the opposite
side<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.299> concept<00:03:03.720> as<00:03:03.959> well<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.890> death

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
side of that concept as well like death

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.699 
side of that concept as well like death
doesn't<00:03:05.970> bring<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.510> death<00:03:06.810> she<00:03:07.260> also<00:03:07.379> brings

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
doesn't bring just death she also brings

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.860 
doesn't bring just death she also brings
life<00:03:08.069> dream<00:03:09.060> doesn't<00:03:09.420> bring<00:03:09.569> just

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
life dream doesn't bring just

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.699 
life dream doesn't bring just
inspiration<00:03:10.709> he<00:03:11.069> can<00:03:11.280> also<00:03:11.579> shape<00:03:12.269> reality

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
inspiration he can also shape reality

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.199 
inspiration he can also shape reality
the<00:03:13.709> one<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:14.010> these<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> find<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.849> most

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the one of these that I find the most

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.119 
the one of these that I find the most
interesting<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.110> actually<00:03:16.290> from<00:03:16.680> delirium

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
interesting is actually from delirium

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.129 
interesting is actually from delirium
because<00:03:17.910> everyone<00:03:18.269> has<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> hard<00:03:18.750> time

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
because everyone has a hard time

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.620 
because everyone has a hard time
understanding<00:03:19.549> delirium<00:03:20.549> but<00:03:20.760> she<00:03:21.269> has<00:03:21.480> this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
understanding delirium but she has this

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.250 
understanding delirium but she has this
logic<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> only<00:03:23.040> she<00:03:23.720> understands<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.200> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
logic that only she understands so it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.140 
logic that only she understands so it
could<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.340> she<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.970> most

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
could be that she is the most

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.170 
could be that she is the most
intelligent<00:03:27.690> being<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.069> universe<00:03:29.579> just

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
intelligent being in the universe just

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.030 
intelligent being in the universe just
no<00:03:30.630> one<00:03:30.810> else<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.349> smart<00:03:31.680> enough<00:03:31.859> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
no one else is smart enough to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030 
no one else is smart enough to
understand<00:03:32.910> her<00:03:33.209> then<00:03:33.510> finally<00:03:34.230> where<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:34.889> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
understand her then finally where do the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.120 
understand her then finally where do the
endless<00:03:35.430> come<00:03:35.670> from<00:03:36.170> we<00:03:37.170> don't<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.920> it

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
endless come from we don't know it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.280 
endless come from we don't know it
