00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.110
 the event a young man that like you and me 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.050
 enjoy all the services that you 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.690
 Can you offer your country 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.480
 during the week you will be studying in 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.490
 the sauna of his institute and when the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.950
 Saturday he meets his legs to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.170
 play a soccer game for the 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.840
 nights but picks up karen quotes her 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.810
 in love who works as a designer in 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.790
 a garment company together they go out 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.430
 to walk and give a distraction to 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.380
 spend a quiet evening 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.920
 Karen said a movie so let's go for 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.780
 one is here where beto should take a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 decision 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 do things legally or not 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 but think you buy a pirate split 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.949
 it is a total harmless act the divides and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.660
 pirate costs cheaper and thinks that no 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.190
 It does not hurt anyone if you do not pay 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.519
 rights of the movie that is being 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.870
 taking home in this veto is wrong 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.969
 let's see why 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.129
 much of the blank discs 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.979
 used for piracy enter 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.290
 our country for smuggling the same 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.740
 way that other goods that do not pay 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.740
 tributes 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.470
 like the pirated drugs that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 imagine and like the disks 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.750
 I would consume counterfeit medicines 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 unfortunately there are still many who 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 they buy piracy and contraband and this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.370
 causes a negative multiplier effect 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 for the country since not collecting is 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.960
 money for the payment of taxes the state 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 stop investing more in services 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.420
 basic that improve our quality of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420
 lifetime 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 in this way there would be no institute 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 public where beto can study or 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.680
 there would be sports slab where to play 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.460
 much less a health center where 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.520
 beto can be attended to any 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.480
 eventuality in his daily life 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 and now how do you see the appetite situation 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.780
 It is estimated that the Peruvian state stops 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 perceive more than 1,600 million 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.840
 suns as a result of smuggling 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.240
 and piracy is to say in the latter 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 five years we have lost around 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.680
 eight billion suns 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 all for buying piracy and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.560
 contraband you realize how much it affects 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.099
 this vicious circle to the industry 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.860
 formal and the generation of employment at 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.920
 less are 100,000 jobs 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.660
 that they stop generating this without 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.670
 consider that the traffic of this 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 illegal merchandise develops 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.040
 complemented by other crimes so 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.140
 serious as drug trafficking activity 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.569
 that takes our country's security 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.239
 but let's go back to the beginning of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.940
 our story because he did not veto and you and I 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.549
 we want this for our country and it is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.340
 time to act responsibly 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.400
 intelligence and respect for others from 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.319
 feel proud of being Peruvian and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.049
 let's start living in healthy coexistence 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.500
 within a culture of respect and 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.959
 respect to our laws to the right of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.580
 author and the quality of life that they expect 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.580
 have all our fellow citizens
