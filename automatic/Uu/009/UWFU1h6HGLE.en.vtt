the recent drill to the taken king which
gives<00:00:39.540> me<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> feeling<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> PlayStation

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
gives me a feeling that the PlayStation

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.950 
gives me a feeling that the PlayStation
exclusive<00:00:41.550> armor<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.270> begin<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> look<00:00:42.719> grid

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.139 
exclusive armor will begin a look grid
in<00:00:43.140> year<00:00:43.350> 2<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.550> now<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.940> only

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
in year 2 because right now it's only

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
in year 2 because right now it's only
rare<00:00:45.570> blue<00:00:45.899> armor<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.039> really

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
rare blue armor and so it's not really

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
rare blue armor and so it's not really
worth<00:00:47.489> wearing<00:00:47.879> either<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.140> bungee

worth wearing either that or bungee

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.709

down the barrel just on the chamber now

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.090 
down the barrel just on the chamber now
this<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> regular<00:01:31.380> hand<00:01:31.770> cannon

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
this could just be a regular hand cannon
that<00:01:32.250> happens<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> same<00:01:33.299> model<00:01:33.780> as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that happens to have the same model as

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
that happens to have the same model as
the<00:01:33.900> last<00:01:34.200> word<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> theory<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the last word but I've a theory that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
the last word but I've a theory that
this<00:01:36.030> could<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> Youtube<00:01:37.020> version<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this could be the Youtube version of the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
this could be the Youtube version of the
last<00:01:37.770> word<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> launch<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
last word so are the launch of the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
last word so are the launch of the
second<00:01:39.869> king<00:01:40.079> only<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> few<00:01:40.950> year<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.340> exotics

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
second king only a few year one exotics

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
second king only a few year one exotics
I've<00:01:41.939> been<00:01:42.060> upgraded<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> year<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> for

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I've been upgraded to a year to for

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
I've been upgraded to a year to for
example<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.070> year<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> version<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.970> service

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
example the year to version of service

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
example the year to version of service
regime<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.500> black<00:01:46.770> instead<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
regime is going to be black instead of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580 
regime is going to be black instead of
white<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.600> since<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> last<00:01:49.200> word<00:01:49.439> has

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
white and so since the last word has

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
white and so since the last word has
been<00:01:49.740> upgraded<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> year<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.210> last<00:01:51.450> wed

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
been upgraded to a year to the last wed

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
been upgraded to a year to the last wed
could<00:01:51.899> also<00:01:52.020> begin<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> paint<00:01:52.740> job<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.430> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
could also begin a paint job just like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
could also begin a paint job just like
service<00:01:54.030> regime<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.140> only<00:01:55.320> problem<00:01:55.560> with

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
service regime the only problem with

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
service regime the only problem with
that<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.610> Youtube<00:01:57.000> version<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.450> last

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that is that the Youtube version of last

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.020 
that is that the Youtube version of last
word<00:01:57.930> still<00:01:58.590> has<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> same<00:01:59.100> colors<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.640> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
word still has the same colors in the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
word still has the same colors in the
preview<00:02:00.479> image<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.590> guess<00:02:01.680> we'll<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:01.979> have

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
preview image so I guess we'll just have

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980 
preview image so I guess we'll just have
to<00:02:02.310> wait<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.490> find<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.119> moving<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to wait and find out more moving on

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.480 
to wait and find out more moving on

let's<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.050> look<00:03:25.320> at<00:03:25.410> some<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.739> smaller

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
let's take a look at some of the smaller

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.000 
let's take a look at some of the smaller
details<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.820> may<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.300> noticed

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
details like you may not have noticed

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.110 
details like you may not have noticed
firstly<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.280> once<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.610> appears<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.030> be

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
firstly this once it appears to be

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.600 
firstly this once it appears to be
wielding<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.630> new<00:03:31.170> exotic<00:03:31.590> heavy<00:03:31.950> machine<00:03:32.400> gun

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
wielding a new exotic heavy machine gun

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.760 
wielding a new exotic heavy machine gun
and<00:03:32.760> if<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.330> look<00:03:33.480> closely<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.110> has<00:03:34.470> void

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
and if you look closely it has void

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.650 
and if you look closely it has void
energy<00:03:35.220> running<00:03:35.459> along<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.730> gun<00:03:36.060> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
energy running along the gun so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.120 
energy running along the gun so
hopefully<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.200> means<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.500> we'll<00:03:37.739> finally

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
hopefully this means that we'll finally

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.180 
hopefully this means that we'll finally
be<00:03:38.190> getting<00:03:38.250> another<00:03:38.940> void<00:03:39.270> exotic<00:03:39.930> next<00:03:40.920> this
