00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.669
 today 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 hello and welcome guys I'm axel and today 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.009
 I bring you the first video of rne build 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.740
 well just leave because I came to 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.470
 see what the area was like and looking at missions 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.170
 and I was lucky that I already found 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.519
 with a monster of these that is sought 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.609
 and more difficult at least level and 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'm going to show you the strategy that we 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.040
 we found her with chance in the middle of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.110
 the fight 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.510
 comes with Celtic blood with a leaf 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.449
 spirit 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.550
 and he was the one who realized how 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.980
 were the strategies good here what 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.469
 first thing that we are going to comment is that what 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.150
 that we see here are the glyphs of those 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.409
 blacks that come out that are bombs 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.740
 yes or trap 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.659
 is by the modifier that leaves the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.450
 Dungeon does not mean that the enemy 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.850
 be good what we have to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.840
 to do is he is always going to come back 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.509
 invisible 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.329
 every time the tour starts, not a 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.120
 our character and what we have to 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.320
 to do is to invoke a lot 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.320
 many invocations 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.569
 when they get their turn they die and they 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.179
 become one of the skulls that 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.140
 we are seeing there and as we see 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.830
 transform 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.590
 and then we have to foresee more or less 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.720
 where the enemy is going to hit him 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.000
 one of those skulls and if it's 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.180
 relatively close as we do it 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 visible if not then it would not work 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.660
 to see how 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.230
 like that and we will be taking out 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.250
 enough invocations to fill the 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.380
 map then a quite long map and have 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.380
 pretty controlled the area 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.430
 well there we saw how Celtic blood 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.950
 hit the skull and we could know where 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.930
 you have to be very careful and be 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.360
 very pending that in the next 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.760
 turn because it is possible to change 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.570
 place jump to another different place there 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.570
 with the fega then 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.140
 and after spending his turn it is 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.050
 changed the time because he could not 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.420
 find another negative thing that with 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.370
 this modifier every time they stepped on 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.950
 the bombs that we were leaving 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.900
 because it took away our life but 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.439
 he was completely healed we had already 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.390
 Well, we hit him quite a bit and in the end 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.670
 it almost filled us up and then we had to 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.740
 Kill him again 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.450
 and good 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.810
 the truth that I find more difficult 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.060
 kill the dumbledore or an utopia 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.760
 it was not so difficult if it's true 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.100
 that it is a bit heavy to be 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.840
 looking but it did not hurt us enough 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.500
 as well as to kill him besides what 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.050
 we kill the first one and without knowing the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.300
 strategy that had to be good 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.840
 there we see where it was changed by 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.840
 one of the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.150
 of the invocations and 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.150
 Well, I knew where I was more or less 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.280
 and there he pointed to the I search because it is 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.000
 where it's going to appear we have to hit him 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.540
 to the skull and the I search and hit him 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.540
 with everything 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.120
 the sun that can not jump the time then 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.120
 hit him with everything 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.170
 and nothing like we see is that I jump and 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.780
 changed place then there is another 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.460
 once guess where it is then look it was 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.060
 there almost completely safe 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.509
 we thought it was going to be that I did not 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.509
 we were going to kill 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.240
 but good and it's just a matter of 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.650
 time now we already knew the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.210
 strategy after being tested 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.470
 and nothing we were looking for 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.720
 looking we did not give in this turn with him 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.570
 and there he moves there he moves with the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.570
 panda because he hit him because I found him 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.560
 it moved 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.990
 Celtic blood, he can not guess 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.850
 where are we thinking he was out there 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.810
 look what he found there he turned to move 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:44.249
 the em and again found the pk it 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.309
 he returned to move the pk he found 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.379
 there's a cure a little bit with him 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.939
 little since I kill it there and good is a 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.529
 enemy that is a bit heavy kill him 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.059
 but it's not that difficult I hope that you 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.869
 have served this video and see you in 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.869
 next a greeting
