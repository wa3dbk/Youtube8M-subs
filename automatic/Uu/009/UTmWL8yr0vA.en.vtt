00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hi guys in today's tutorial I'd like to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.039 
hi guys in today's tutorial I'd like to
show<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.550> how<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.000> can<00:00:03.240> build<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.600> super

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
show you how you can build a super

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.320 
show you how you can build a super
simple<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.710> white<00:00:04.980> will<00:00:05.460> add<00:00:05.609> red<00:00:05.790> trading

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
simple one white will add red trading

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.140 
simple one white will add red trading
Hall<00:00:06.600> what<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:07.740> see<00:00:08.010> over<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
Hall what you can see over here is the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.870 
Hall what you can see over here is the
filling<00:00:09.719> mechanism<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.190> trading<00:00:11.519> hall

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
filling mechanism of the trading hall

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.060 
filling mechanism of the trading hall
and<00:00:12.150> as<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.440> using<00:00:13.469> mine

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and as you can see we are using mine

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.849 
and as you can see we are using mine
cards<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.759> water<00:00:15.389> streams<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.139> transport<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
cards and water streams to transport the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.340 
cards and water streams to transport the
villagers<00:00:17.250> around<00:00:17.840> then<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
villagers around then you have the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.779 
villagers around then you have the
villagers<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:19.949> next<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> each<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.520> so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
villagers right next to each other so

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.450 
villagers right next to each other so
you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.910> stand<00:00:21.359> over<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:22.080> trade<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.220> them

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you can stand over here trade with them

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.109 
you can stand over here trade with them
and<00:00:24.199> if<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.250> trade<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.910> can

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and if you don't like the trade you can

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.109 
and if you don't like the trade you can
simply<00:00:27.570> sort<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.590> villages<00:00:29.220> by<00:00:29.519> pressing

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
simply sort out the villages by pressing

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
simply sort out the villages by pressing
the<00:00:30.240> button<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> villager<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.830> drop<00:00:32.070> down

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the button the villager will drop down

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
the button the villager will drop down
and<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.759> new<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.390> 4m<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> fence

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and a new one will 4m because the fence

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.639 
and a new one will 4m because the fence
gate<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.399> opened<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> new

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
gate will be opened and so there's a new

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.299 
gate will be opened and so there's a new
space<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.340> villager<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> design<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.100> also

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
space for a villager the design is also

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.910 
space for a villager the design is also
super<00:00:41.850> cheap<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.390> super<00:00:42.989> small<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.890> see

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
super cheap and super small you can see

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
super cheap and super small you can see
here<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> side<00:00:44.969> view<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.710> don't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
here in the side view that you don't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
here in the side view that you don't
need<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.570> few

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
need a lot for this it's just a few

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.189 
need a lot for this it's just a few
blocks<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.170> few<00:00:49.379> rails<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.750> three<00:00:51.750> redstone

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
blocks a few rails and three redstone

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
blocks a few rails and three redstone
torches<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> repeater<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.489> fence<00:00:53.730> gate<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
torches a repeater a fence gate and a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.700 
torches a repeater a fence gate and a
trapdoor

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
trapdoor

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
trapdoor
so<00:00:56.100> I'd<00:00:56.309> say<00:00:56.640> let<00:00:56.940> me<00:00:56.969> show<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> build

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so I'd say let me show you how to build

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.310 
so I'd say let me show you how to build
this<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> start<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this up so you want to start with the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
this up so you want to start with the
right<00:01:01.440> placement<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.160> rails

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
right placement of your rails

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
right placement of your rails
therefore<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.629> imagine<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> our

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
therefore we imagine that this is our

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
therefore we imagine that this is our
floor<00:01:05.549> level<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.150> leave<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.570> gap<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
floor level then we leave one gap and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.890 
floor level then we leave one gap and
build<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.740> staircase<00:01:08.159> by<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:09.330> blocks<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
build up a staircase by three blocks and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
build up a staircase by three blocks and
we<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> already<00:01:10.439> make<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> wider

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we can already make make this wider

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
we can already make make this wider
because<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.540> course<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.869> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.200> more

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
because of course we want to have more

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
because of course we want to have more
than<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.979> segment<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.760> we'll<00:01:15.000> make<00:01:15.270> four

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
than just one segment so we'll make four

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
than just one segment so we'll make four
right<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.250> just<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> purpose<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
right now just for the purpose of the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.609 
right now just for the purpose of the
tutorial<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> place<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.380> army

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
tutorial then you place down an army

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
tutorial then you place down an army
rail<00:01:19.770> powered<00:01:20.460> rail<00:01:20.670> detect<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> rail

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
rail powered rail detect the rail

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
rail powered rail detect the rail
nominal<00:01:22.500> rate<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> continue<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
nominal rate and you continue that just

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.580 
nominal rate and you continue that just
going<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.240> we<00:01:27.240> need<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.780> nominal<00:01:28.470> rails

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
going up and we need the nominal rails

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.609 
going up and we need the nominal rails
there<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.549> align<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:30.380> detector<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there just to align our detector and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.550 
there just to align our detector and
powered<00:01:32.070> rails<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.259> when

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
powered rails in the right way so when

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.690 
powered rails in the right way so when
you're<00:01:34.740> done<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.400> should<00:01:35.549> look

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're done with that it should look

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're done with that it should look
like<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.630> take<00:01:36.869> away<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.799> normal

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
like this you can take away the normal

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
like this you can take away the normal
rates<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.329> should<00:01:39.540> stay<00:01:39.900> how

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
rates again and these should stay how

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.130 
rates again and these should stay how
they<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.150> into<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.930> want

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
they are then go into the back we want

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
they are then go into the back we want
to<00:01:43.380> power<00:01:43.950> our<00:01:44.220> powered<00:01:44.909> rails<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.700> they<00:01:47.700> are

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to power our powered rails so they are

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
to power our powered rails so they are
now<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.180> powered<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.500> detector<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> will

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
now all powered and the detector is will

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
now all powered and the detector is will
give<00:01:50.460> us<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> output<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> redstone<00:01:51.869> torch

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
give us the output into a redstone torch

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
give us the output into a redstone torch
we<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.710> place<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.579> place<00:01:53.880> another

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
we can place it then place another

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.230 
we can place it then place another
redstone<00:01:54.689> torch<00:01:54.960> behind<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.670> block

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
redstone torch behind that then a block

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
redstone torch behind that then a block
on<00:01:57.450> top<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.820> another<00:01:59.820> redstone

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
on top of that and another redstone

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.569 
on top of that and another redstone
torch<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:01.829> will<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:03.119> taken<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
torch that will then get taken into a

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.210 
torch that will then get taken into a
repeater<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.969> from<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.079> repeater<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.979> want

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
repeater and from this repeater we want

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.969 
repeater and from this repeater we want
to<00:02:08.429> power<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:09.060> fence<00:02:09.360> gates<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.739> place

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to power some fence gates so we place

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
to power some fence gates so we place
them<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
them right here and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.390 
them right here and
then<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:13.019> can<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.379> away<00:02:13.620> those<00:02:13.769> blocks<00:02:14.129> again

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
then we can take away those blocks again

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.199 
then we can take away those blocks again
and<00:02:14.659> then<00:02:15.659> right<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:17.010> at<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.519> position<00:02:18.030> we

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
and then right here at this position we

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.649 
and then right here at this position we
want<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.659> then<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.439> trap<00:02:20.159> door<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.510> want

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
want to have then a trap door so we want

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.440 
want to have then a trap door so we want
to<00:02:21.750> place<00:02:22.019> some<00:02:22.319> half<00:02:22.590> flaps<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.159> front<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:24.299> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to place some half flaps in front so we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.640 
to place some half flaps in front so we
can<00:02:24.719> then<00:02:24.900> place<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.739> trap<00:02:26.040> door<00:02:26.780> right<00:02:27.780> onto

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
can then place the trap door right onto

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280 
can then place the trap door right onto
this<00:02:28.799> half<00:02:29.129> slab<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.510> lower<00:02:30.659> part<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.109> it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this half slab on the lower part of it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.729 
this half slab on the lower part of it
so<00:02:32.069> if<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:32.700> now<00:02:32.849> place<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.450> block<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.049> top<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.560> it

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
so if we now place a block on top of it

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.119 
so if we now place a block on top of it
and<00:02:35.120> go<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.359> by<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:36.930> block<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.859> can

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
and go on up by one more block we can

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.259 
and go on up by one more block we can
then<00:02:38.370> place<00:02:38.639> some<00:02:39.409> buttons<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:41.909> can

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
then place some buttons so we can

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.110 
then place some buttons so we can
activate<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.560> trapdoors<00:02:44.069> easily<00:02:44.549> right<00:02:45.090> here

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
activate the trapdoors easily right here

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.569 
activate the trapdoors easily right here
this<00:02:46.109> button<00:02:46.290> will<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:46.709> activate<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.370> trap

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
this button will now activate the trap

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.330 
this button will now activate the trap
door<00:02:47.730> down<00:02:47.879> there<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:49.319> we<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:49.799> grab<00:02:50.129> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
door down there and if we now grab a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.059 
door down there and if we now grab a
minecart<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.419> already<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:52.139> that<00:02:52.319> this

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
minecart you can already see that this

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.039 
minecart you can already see that this
will<00:02:53.250> close<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.909> fence<00:02:54.299> gate<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:54.900> I

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
will close this fence gate and if I

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.199 
will close this fence gate and if I
press<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> button<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.400> minecart<00:02:56.819> will<00:02:57.000> drive

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
press the button the minecart will drive

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.750 
press the button the minecart will drive
down<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:58.169> there<00:02:58.349> was<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> block<00:02:58.769> then<00:02:59.370> down

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
down and if there was a block then down

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.869 
down and if there was a block then down
here<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.599> minecart<00:03:01.019> would<00:03:01.200> drive<00:03:01.500> into<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.069> so

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
here the minecart would drive into it so

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.539 
here the minecart would drive into it so
now<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.540> make<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:04.079> segment<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:04.829> wide<00:03:05.310> as

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
now you can make this segment as wide as

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.339 
now you can make this segment as wide as
you<00:03:05.790> want<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.329> will<00:03:07.169> continue<00:03:07.590> from<00:03:08.400> there

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
you want and will continue from there

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.420 
you want and will continue from there
once<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.439> have<00:03:10.560> lengths<00:03:10.919> that<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.099> are<00:03:11.250> happy

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
once you have lengths that you are happy

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.429 
once you have lengths that you are happy
with<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:12.030> put<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.419> the<00:03:12.540> water<00:03:12.720> streams<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
with you can put in the water streams to

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.349 
with you can put in the water streams to
take<00:03:13.650> care<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.069> in-and-out<00:03:14.489> coming<00:03:15.150> will

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
take care of the in-and-out coming will

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.420 
take care of the in-and-out coming will
adjust<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:15.870> step<00:03:16.620> four<00:03:16.769> we<00:03:16.889> want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.129> start

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
adjust and step four we want to start

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.789 
adjust and step four we want to start
down<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.449> the<00:03:18.690> outcoming<00:03:19.199> ones<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
down here for the outcoming ones and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.580 
down here for the outcoming ones and
therefore<00:03:20.729> we<00:03:20.849> block<00:03:21.120> off<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.659> one<00:03:21.900> side<00:03:22.290> and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
therefore we block off just one side and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.009 
therefore we block off just one side and
then<00:03:22.889> start<00:03:23.250> placing<00:03:23.549> water<00:03:23.879> source<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.510> at

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
then start placing water source and at

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.839 
then start placing water source and at
the<00:03:25.199> end<00:03:25.379> of<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.769> water<00:03:26.040> source<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.579> just

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
the end of this water source we just

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.390 
the end of this water source we just
place<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> sign<00:03:27.479> the<00:03:28.290> next<00:03:28.590> water<00:03:28.769> source<00:03:29.159> and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
place a sign the next water source and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.729 
place a sign the next water source and
continue<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.359> all<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:31.019> way<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.560> end

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
continue this all the way to the end

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.539 
continue this all the way to the end
until<00:03:32.479> yeah<00:03:33.479> you<00:03:33.540> reach<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.079> point<00:03:34.109> where<00:03:34.919> you

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
until yeah you reach a point where you

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.159 
until yeah you reach a point where you
want<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.849> do<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.209> something<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.870> double

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
want to do then something with double

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
coming to this block and I could now dig

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.339 
coming to this block and I could now dig
down<00:03:43.590> here<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:45.120> place<00:03:45.479> for<00:03:45.780> example<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
powered rail and let them drive

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.449 
powered rail and let them drive
somewhere<00:03:48.870> why<00:03:49.169> I<00:03:49.199> want<00:03:49.500> where<00:03:49.889> I<00:03:49.919> want<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.190> do

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
somewhere why I want where I want to do

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.319 
somewhere why I want where I want to do
something<00:03:50.940> with<00:03:51.090> them<00:03:51.299> again<00:03:51.949> for<00:03:52.949> up<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.790> we

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
something with them again for up here we

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.449 
something with them again for up here we
just<00:03:54.359> need<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.930> place<00:03:55.199> another<00:03:55.650> row<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.889> blocks

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
just need to place another row of blocks

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.369 
just need to place another row of blocks
next<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.000> these<00:03:57.180> fence<00:03:57.510> gates<00:03:57.840> because

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
next to these fence gates because

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.920 
next to these fence gates because
otherwise<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.579> water<00:03:59.729> would<00:03:59.939> destroy<00:04:00.659> our

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
otherwise the water would destroy our

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
otherwise the water would destroy our
redstone<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.769> then<00:04:02.699> you<00:04:02.849> do<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.239> same<00:04:03.419> thing

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
redstone and then you do the same thing

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.599 
redstone and then you do the same thing
over<00:04:03.959> here<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.859> end<00:04:05.040> where<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.310> want<00:04:05.519> to

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
over here in the end where you want to

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.879 
over here in the end where you want to
start<00:04:05.970> bringing<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.449> villagers<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.109> recommend

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
start bringing in villagers I recommend

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.580 
start bringing in villagers I recommend
to<00:04:07.979> place<00:04:08.220> another<00:04:08.699> fence<00:04:09.060> gate<00:04:09.419> or<00:04:09.659> maybe

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
to place another fence gate or maybe

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.050 
to place another fence gate or maybe
even<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:12.060> align<00:04:12.479> them<00:04:12.720> easier<00:04:13.229> and

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
even to just to align them easier and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.360 
even to just to align them easier and
then<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.359> can<00:04:15.599> bring<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.229> blocks<00:04:16.500> around<00:04:17.039> and

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
then we can bring the blocks around and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.180 
then we can bring the blocks around and
like<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.570> close<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.049> off<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.470> then<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.130> can

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
like this close it off and then you can

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.700 
like this close it off and then you can
also<00:04:20.430> start<00:04:21.239> putting<00:04:21.659> in<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.049> water<00:04:22.229> sources

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
also start putting in the water sources

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.380 
also start putting in the water sources
put<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.250> sign<00:04:23.779> water<00:04:24.779> source

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
put a sign water source

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.780 
put a sign water source
sign<00:04:27.390> just<00:04:27.900> be<00:04:28.080> careful<00:04:28.500> at<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:29.160> end<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
sign just be careful at the end that the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.720 
sign just be careful at the end that the
water<00:04:30.000> doesn't<00:04:30.300> flow<00:04:30.630> out<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.260> your<00:04:31.440> machine

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
water doesn't flow out of your machine

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.190 
water doesn't flow out of your machine
because<00:04:32.730> yeah<00:04:33.300> right<00:04:33.510> here<00:04:33.690> would<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.050> now<00:04:34.170> a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
because yeah right here would be now a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.060 
because yeah right here would be now a
bit<00:04:34.500> tricky<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.760> what<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.600> recommend<00:04:37.080> doing<00:04:37.590> is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
bit tricky so what I recommend doing is

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.800 
bit tricky so what I recommend doing is
connect<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:40.800> over<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.550> where<00:04:42.330> your

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
connect this just over to where your

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.610 
connect this just over to where your
drop<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.350> for<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.100> other<00:04:44.190> ones<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:45.270> my<00:04:45.480> case

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
drop is for the other ones so in my case

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.950 
drop is for the other ones so in my case
right<00:04:46.620> here<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.040> can<00:04:47.310> bring<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.670> down<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.780> they

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
right here I can bring this down so they

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.950 
right here I can bring this down so they
will<00:04:49.140> also<00:04:49.320> drop<00:04:49.620> onto<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.130> rail<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.420> can

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
will also drop onto this rail and I can

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.930 
will also drop onto this rail and I can
do<00:04:52.410> whatever<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:53.220> them<00:04:53.370> kill<00:04:53.730> them

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
do whatever I like with them kill them

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.680 
do whatever I like with them kill them
or<00:04:54.150> put<00:04:55.080> them<00:04:55.260> into<00:04:55.440> another<00:04:55.770> cell<00:04:56.100> again

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
or put them into another cell again

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.570 
or put them into another cell again
so<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.020> it's<00:04:58.260> not<00:04:58.440> all<00:04:58.680> encased<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.490> I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
so like this it's not all encased and I

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.570 
so like this it's not all encased and I
can<00:04:59.730> place<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.210> water<00:05:00.450> sauce<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.580> since

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
can place this water sauce and since

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.400 
can place this water sauce and since
this<00:05:02.760> is<00:05:02.910> not<00:05:03.060> flown<00:05:03.330> around<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.990> corner

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
this is not flown around the corner

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.810 
this is not flown around the corner
place<00:05:05.250> another<00:05:05.520> sign<00:05:05.790> there<00:05:06.200> sign<00:05:07.200> here<00:05:07.620> and

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
place another sign there sign here and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.310 
place another sign there sign here and
place<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:09.120> water<00:05:09.420> sauce<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.080> should

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
place this water sauce and this should

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.540 
place this water sauce and this should
bring<00:05:10.770> them<00:05:10.920> down<00:05:11.100> onto<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.030> rail<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:13.550> rarely

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
bring them down onto this rail it rarely

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.580 
bring them down onto this rail it rarely
happens<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.420> villager<00:05:15.870> gets<00:05:16.080> stuck<00:05:16.380> in<00:05:16.500> a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
happens that a villager gets stuck in a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.320 
happens that a villager gets stuck in a
position<00:05:16.890> like<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.490> but<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.910> don't<00:05:18.030> have<00:05:18.210> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
position like this but you don't have to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.390 
position like this but you don't have to
worry<00:05:18.570> about<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:19.050> because<00:05:19.230> as<00:05:19.770> soon<00:05:20.040> as<00:05:20.220> the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
worry about it because as soon as the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.220 
worry about it because as soon as the
next<00:05:20.670> villager<00:05:21.060> will<00:05:21.240> come<00:05:21.450> along<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:22.050> will

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
next villager will come along it will

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.590 
next villager will come along it will
push<00:05:22.500> him<00:05:22.710> over<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.640> he<00:05:23.670> will<00:05:24.090> continue<00:05:24.420> his

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
push him over and he will continue his

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.270 
push him over and he will continue his
travel<00:05:25.200> in<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.830> water<00:05:26.070> stream<00:05:27.980> last<00:05:28.980> of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
travel in the water stream last of

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.800 
travel in the water stream last of
course<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.640> quickly<00:05:29.880> want<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.210> show<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.510> how

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
you can get the villagers into the

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.310 
you can get the villagers into the
minecart<00:05:32.730> and<00:05:32.880> then<00:05:33.120> into<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.690> machine<00:05:34.080> and

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
minecart and then into the machine and

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.980 
minecart and then into the machine and
all<00:05:35.100> you<00:05:35.430> need<00:05:35.640> is<00:05:35.880> really<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.330> rail<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
all you need is really a rail in the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.810 
all you need is really a rail in the
very<00:05:37.170> beginning<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:38.010> leads<00:05:38.280> into<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.640> water

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
very beginning that leads into the water

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.640 
very beginning that leads into the water
stream<00:05:39.000> like<00:05:39.480> you<00:05:39.600> can<00:05:39.780> see<00:05:39.990> over<00:05:40.110> here

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
stream like you can see over here

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.170 
stream like you can see over here
but<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:40.980> also<00:05:41.160> want<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.460> show<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.670> how<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:41.970> can

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
get the villagers into the minecart so

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.590 
get the villagers into the minecart so
I've<00:05:43.860> set<00:05:44.100> up<00:05:44.130> a<00:05:44.280> little<00:05:44.430> bit<00:05:44.580> more<00:05:44.730> so<00:05:45.270> really

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
I've set up a little bit more so really

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.390 
I've set up a little bit more so really
what<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.930> need<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:46.770> piece<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.190> rail

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
what you need is just this piece of rail

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.830 
what you need is just this piece of rail
here<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.610> then<00:05:47.820> connected<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.360> array<00:05:48.630> with

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
here and then connected to array with

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.690 
here and then connected to array with
the<00:05:48.870> villagers<00:05:49.380> but<00:05:49.920> if<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:50.190> want<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.430> get<00:05:50.580> the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
the villagers but if you want to get the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.760 
the villagers but if you want to get the
villagers<00:05:51.060> from<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.540> water<00:05:51.810> stream<00:05:52.110> into<00:05:52.740> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
villagers from a water stream into the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.800 
villagers from a water stream into the
minecart<00:05:53.460> -<00:05:53.700> then<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.000> can<00:05:54.180> set<00:05:54.480> it<00:05:54.600> up<00:05:54.690> like

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
minecart - then you can set it up like

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.650 
minecart - then you can set it up like
this<00:05:55.130> so<00:05:56.130> what<00:05:56.490> I've<00:05:56.610> got<00:05:56.640> here<00:05:56.850> is<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.300> 2<00:05:57.360> by<00:05:57.630> 2

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
this so what I've got here is a 2 by 2

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.290 
this so what I've got here is a 2 by 2
box<00:05:58.110> with<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.710> diagonal<00:05:59.100> water<00:05:59.430> stream<00:05:59.850> and<00:06:00.060> in

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
box with a diagonal water stream and in

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.820 
box with a diagonal water stream and in
the<00:06:00.450> corner<00:06:00.840> where<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.110> water<00:06:01.290> stream<00:06:01.530> ends

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
the corner where the water stream ends

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.160 
the corner where the water stream ends
there's<00:06:02.040> a<00:06:02.220> powered<00:06:02.580> rail<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.540> minecart<00:06:04.020> is

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
there's a powered rail the minecart is

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.410 
there's a powered rail the minecart is
driving<00:06:04.620> up<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:04.890> down<00:06:04.980> here<00:06:05.460> does<00:06:05.940> not<00:06:05.970> have

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
driving up and down here does not have

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.230 
driving up and down here does not have
enough<00:06:07.080> enough<00:06:07.650> momentum<00:06:07.830> to<00:06:08.370> reach<00:06:08.880> the

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
enough enough momentum to reach the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.120 
enough enough momentum to reach the
other<00:06:09.420> powered<00:06:09.810> rail<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.680> will<00:06:10.860> stay<00:06:11.100> on

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
other powered rail so it will stay on

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.310 
other powered rail so it will stay on
these<00:06:11.460> two<00:06:11.730> normal<00:06:12.090> rates<00:06:12.390> and<00:06:12.600> then<00:06:13.110> there's

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
these two normal rates and then there's

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.050 
these two normal rates and then there's
another<00:06:13.440> powered<00:06:13.950> rail<00:06:14.130> up<00:06:14.250> here<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:14.730> a

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
another powered rail up here and a

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.860 
another powered rail up here and a
detector<00:06:15.660> rail<00:06:16.070> so<00:06:17.070> if<00:06:17.220> I<00:06:17.540> place<00:06:18.540> in<00:06:18.780> a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
detector rail so if I place in a

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.840 
detector rail so if I place in a
villager<00:06:19.200> now<00:06:19.350> here<00:06:19.890> we<00:06:19.980> go<00:06:20.190> into<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.670> main

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
villager now here we go into the main

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.330 
villager now here we go into the main
card<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:21.330> we<00:06:22.170> drive<00:06:22.530> off<00:06:22.800> into<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.130> water

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
card and we drive off into the water

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.820 
card and we drive off into the water
stream<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:24.000> then<00:06:24.810> because<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.260> detector

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
stream and then because the detector

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.490 
stream and then because the detector
read<00:06:26.040> detect<00:06:26.910> if<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.360> minecart<00:06:27.720> is<00:06:27.930> driving

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
read detect if the minecart is driving

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.670 
read detect if the minecart is driving
over<00:06:28.980> it<00:06:29.070> it<00:06:29.730> will<00:06:29.790> give<00:06:30.120> after<00:06:30.570> 12<00:06:31.110> ticks<00:06:31.470> of

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
over it it will give after 12 ticks of

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.410 
over it it will give after 12 ticks of
delay<00:06:32.190> here<00:06:32.520> then<00:06:32.700> a<00:06:32.790> signal<00:06:32.970> to<00:06:33.270> this

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
delay here then a signal to this

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.210 
delay here then a signal to this
dispenser<00:06:33.840> which<00:06:34.440> would<00:06:34.650> just<00:06:34.920> simply

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
dispenser which would just simply

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.850 
dispenser which would just simply
dispense<00:06:35.790> a<00:06:36.000> new<00:06:36.180> minecart<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.900> system<00:06:37.320> so

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
dispense a new minecart to the system so

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.890 
dispense a new minecart to the system so
you<00:06:37.890> can<00:06:38.040> have

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
you can have

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.250 
you can have
many<00:06:39.320> villages<00:06:39.860> in<00:06:40.130> here<00:06:40.610> and<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.930> machine

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
many villages in here and the machine

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.290 
many villages in here and the machine
will<00:06:42.530> slowly<00:06:42.889> fill<00:06:43.160> up<00:06:43.340> over<00:06:43.639> time<00:06:43.820> as<00:06:44.030> long<00:06:44.240> as

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
will slowly fill up over time as long as

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.480 
will slowly fill up over time as long as
you<00:06:44.570> have<00:06:44.720> mine<00:06:44.960> cards<00:06:45.350> up<00:06:45.470> there<00:06:46.130> in<00:06:46.340> the

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
you have mine cards up there in the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.420 
you have mine cards up there in the
dispenser<00:06:47.470> so<00:06:48.470> if<00:06:48.710> you<00:06:48.830> can't<00:06:49.040> want<00:06:49.190> to<00:06:49.250> get
