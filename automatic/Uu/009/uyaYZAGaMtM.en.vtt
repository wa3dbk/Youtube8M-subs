00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.320
 This week in the link we talk about 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.469
 samsung galaxy s new 4g bet 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 samsung as flagship of androids s 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 rose launched new york last week 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.640
 in a super launch this mobile and the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 camilo rock man object speaks of him 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.930
 This week's column he is the chief car. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 even a superstar how is that cellphone 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 because it 's the predecessor of it's galaxy s 3 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 which is the in 2012 was the most smartphone 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 sold the world and consolidated the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 position of samsung as the largest 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 the world's smartphone saleswoman then 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.379
 the phone marches to apologize to samsung is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 greater is the largest android manufacturer 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.030
 samsung smartphone seller 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 really the great competitor of the time and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 now this new galaxy is s4 come to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.020
 To say more, I think that this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.750
 market dominance samsung position 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.539
 but the company also made it clear that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.549
 not only dominate the numbers in the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.119
 sales but also forgets leader of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.340
 innovation that is to be the apple that is right 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.680
 has perhaps been for some is no longer so 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 more but what apple and your iphone 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 represented for so many years is like 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.580
 an innovation reference is samsung 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.470
 third now because they bring 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.009
 really new and innovative in this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 home 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 Look, is something has two items as well? 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 interesting new ones, I do not know if the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.979
 enough to give them this character. 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 of the Christian nation which is more like having a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.740
 resource that consolidates the and wondering 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.439
 as it was quite global that the cms 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.280
 translator that a translator of you and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.439
 for messages to nine languages 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.750
 interesting is that it includes in these new 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 lines in Brazilian Portuguese, which 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.100
 shows that samsung has a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.600
 Special concern with Brazil, right? 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.329
 Because she always said that Brazil is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.250
 one of its main markets 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.799
 this gives her an advantage at least 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.390
 in Brazil with regard to apple that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.870
 never bothered to make a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.530
 Brazilian Portuguese version 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.930
 today giving Syria for example is inclusive 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 in the presentation that he cited, which was 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.010
 an event that apparently had 3,000 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.110
 3 thousand guests were on the radio 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.630
 city ​​music hall a super place 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.070
 Traditional New York with and seemed 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.830
 a broadway show then each 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.980
 smartphone feature was shown with 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.270
 a musical number with actors with the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.610
 scenery a super great thing is and there 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.470
 brazil was also featured in the beginning 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.500
 evening January 1st river scenery one 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.210
 face showing a situation in the river of 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.340
 January was not funny 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.320
 the camera is also looks like the camera is 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 a supercamera is one of the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.700
 do not call me 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 because it is is the camera has 3 megapixels which is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.270
 one places this cell phone as one of the most 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.160
 in this category is that the camera 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.110
 the front camera has 2 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.510
 megapixels which is also a high number 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.150
 for the front camera and even a feature 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.390
 that sent the camera that can you can 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.080
 shoot a video take pictures with both 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 cameras at the same time seeing insanity is 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.030
 It's to be creative and with that there and 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.680
 Closes in Brazil has forecast has price 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.330
 forecast to get here 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.050
 the global launch forecast 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.239
 including Brazil is April 26 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.700
 are two prices will reach here have a 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:41.730
 model 3g that 2.399 that I think the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.080
 samsung went from model 4g which is 2,499 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.200
 We need these models are for the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.090
 16 gb storage version 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.120
 out there are two more versions of 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.760
 storage of 32 and 64 but these by 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.040
 while you do not see Brazil only 16 gig 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.350
 but we will also expand this 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.160
 memory with a little card there goes to 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.160
 64gb
