00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
may lie the first pack I was like oh

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.910 
may lie the first pack I was like oh
green<00:06:35.750> what<00:06:36.020> that's<00:06:36.290> the<00:06:36.380> obvious<00:06:36.500> where<00:06:36.830> we

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
green what that's the obvious where we

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.400 
green what that's the obvious where we
go<00:06:37.100> but<00:06:37.730> then<00:06:37.850> we<00:06:38.180> might<00:06:38.330> lose<00:06:38.570> something<00:06:39.320> I

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
go but then we might lose something I

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.750 
go but then we might lose something I
guess<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:39.800> then<00:06:39.920> the<00:06:40.130> middle<00:06:40.400> it<00:06:40.520> was<00:06:40.610> like

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
guess and then the middle it was like

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.140 
guess and then the middle it was like
okay<00:06:41.270> maybe<00:06:41.450> red<00:06:42.110> red<00:06:42.590> white<00:06:42.830> but<00:06:43.760> then<00:06:43.910> we<00:06:44.030> get

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
okay maybe red red white but then we get

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.610 
okay maybe red red white but then we get
to<00:06:44.240> the<00:06:44.360> end<00:06:44.390> with<00:06:44.690> fossa<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.230> some<00:06:45.470> of<00:06:45.560> the

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
to the end with fossa and some of the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.350 
to the end with fossa and some of the
others<00:06:45.770> like<00:06:46.100> later<00:06:46.370> blue<00:06:46.640> cards<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.060> pulled

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
others like later blue cards you pulled

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.760 
others like later blue cards you pulled
blue<00:06:47.840> white<00:06:48.080> officers<00:06:48.440> you've<00:06:48.560> been<00:06:48.680> an

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
blue white officers you've been an

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.830 
blue white officers you've been an
option<00:06:48.920> so<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.610> would<00:06:50.090> probably<00:06:50.210> try<00:06:50.480> to<00:06:50.540> force

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
option so I would probably try to force

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.560 
option so I would probably try to force
three<00:06:51.260> color<00:06:51.500> just<00:06:52.340> go<00:06:52.520> back<00:06:52.760> with<00:06:53.060> it<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.330> think

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
three color just go back with it I think

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.930
