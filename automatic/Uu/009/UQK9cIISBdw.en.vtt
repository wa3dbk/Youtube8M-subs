00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
short of money so that's a try to figure

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.000 
short of money so that's a try to figure
out<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> camera<00:00:43.860> as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
out a way to get the camera as

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
out a way to get the camera as
affordable<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.629> cheaply<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.050> possible

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
affordable and as cheaply as possible

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.369 
affordable and as cheaply as possible
and<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.329> first<00:00:48.360> tripod<00:00:49.079> i
