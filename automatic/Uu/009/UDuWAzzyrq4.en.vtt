powerful so this one modification makes
it<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:38.079> know<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.349> does<00:01:38.529> add<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.829> little<00:01:39.490> bit

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it so you know it does add a little bit

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.370 
it so you know it does add a little bit

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
advantage of it the changes are overall

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.879 
advantage of it the changes are overall
very<00:01:44.649> good<00:01:44.789> but<00:01:45.789> they<00:01:46.450> don't<00:01:46.659> really<00:01:46.779> fix<00:01:47.560> any

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
very good but they don't really fix any

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
to entertain after some time and this is

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.890 
to entertain after some time and this is
something<00:03:09.099> i<00:03:09.400> tend<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.909> expect<00:03:10.389> every<00:03:10.629> time<00:03:10.810> I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
something i tend to expect every time I

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.410 
something i tend to expect every time I
return<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.439> game<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.579> feel<00:03:12.939> that<00:03:13.060> maybe

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
return to the game and I feel that maybe

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.080 
return to the game and I feel that maybe
maybe<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.260> coming<00:03:14.620> back<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:16.000> know

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
maybe not it's coming back you know

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.729 
maybe not it's coming back you know
these<00:03:16.299> days<00:03:16.510> after<00:03:16.870> playing<00:03:17.139> for<00:03:17.260> three<00:03:17.530> days

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
these days after playing for three days

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.930 
these days after playing for three days
or<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.959> however<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.400> something<00:03:21.819> that

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
or so however there is something that

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.479 
or so however there is something that
POV<00:03:22.359> has<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.989> Diablo<00:03:23.500> doesn't<00:03:23.919> have<00:03:24.069> and

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
that is a real ladder system and this is

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.089 
that is a real ladder system and this is
really<00:03:28.690> relevant<00:03:28.959> because<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:31.090> path<00:03:31.449> of<00:03:31.629> exile

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
really relevant because in path of exile

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
when there is a new ladder sometimes it

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.869 
when there is a new ladder sometimes it
lasts<00:03:35.019> an<00:03:35.319> hour<00:03:35.769> sometimes<00:03:36.129> left<00:03:36.519> three<00:03:36.849> hours

back<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.480> get<00:03:40.720> its<00:03:40.840> last<00:03:41.079> two<00:03:41.440> weeks<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.980> the

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
back to get its last two weeks and the

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.460 
back to get its last two weeks and the
real<00:03:43.090> reason<00:03:43.449> that<00:03:43.480> Mexican<00:03:44.049> game<00:03:44.199> is<00:03:44.349> that

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
real reason that Mexican game is that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.039 
real reason that Mexican game is that
they've<00:03:44.769> made<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.699> the<00:03:45.940> rule<00:03:46.269> sets<00:03:46.629> that

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
they've made it so the rule sets that

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.819 
they've made it so the rule sets that
control<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.040> world<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.639> you<00:03:48.790> play<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.180> are

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
control the world that you play in are

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.490 
control the world that you play in are
fundamentally<00:03:50.829> changed<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.199> this

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
fundamentally changed and this is this

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.250 
fundamentally changed and this is this
is<00:03:53.680> what<00:03:53.829> makes<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.940> know<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.389> is<00:03:55.569> why

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
is what makes it you know this is why

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.990 
is what makes it you know this is why
you<00:03:56.319> would<00:03:56.709> actually<00:03:56.889> want<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.639> participate

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
you would actually want to participate

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.729 
you would actually want to participate
in<00:03:58.329> this<00:03:59.169> kind<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.829> ladder<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:01.290> yes<00:04:02.290> there<00:04:02.590> is

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
in this kind of ladder and yes there is

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.550 
in this kind of ladder and yes there is
just<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.340> normal<00:04:03.699> reset<00:04:04.120> system<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.989> point

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
just the normal reset system the point

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.520 
just the normal reset system the point
where<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.120> see<00:04:07.359> in<00:04:07.449> diablo<00:04:07.959> 2<00:04:08.169> they<00:04:08.379> would

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
essentially a new account because I play

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.990

on my own account but on the EU side and
I<00:05:29.150> had<00:05:29.330> absolutely<00:05:29.570> nothing<00:05:30.500> there<00:05:30.860> so<00:05:31.430> this

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
I had absolutely nothing there so this

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.390 
I had absolutely nothing there so this
notion<00:05:32.419> of<00:05:32.630> starting<00:05:33.080> over<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.889> didn't<00:05:34.250> really

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
notion of starting over it didn't really

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.700 
notion of starting over it didn't really
catch<00:05:34.700> up<00:05:34.880> with<00:05:35.000> me<00:05:35.150> too<00:05:35.360> well<00:05:35.539> because<00:05:35.750> you
