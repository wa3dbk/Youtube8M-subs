I'm<00:00:36.719> loving<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> links<00:00:37.590> okay<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.280> most<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I'm loving the links okay so most of my

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.139 
I'm loving the links okay so most of my
locks<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:39.780> thick<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.910> locks

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
locks are pretty thick but all my locks

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.010 
locks are pretty thick but all my locks
around<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.719> perimeter<00:00:43.460> all<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.020> hairline

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
around my perimeter all of my hairline

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.790 
around my perimeter all of my hairline
locks<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.950> thinner<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.410> general<00:00:49.410> than<00:00:49.649> my

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
locks are thinner in general than my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
locks are thinner in general than my
other<00:00:49.950> locks<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> I've

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
other locks so because of that I've

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.799 
other locks so because of that I've
noticed<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.430> slight<00:00:53.699> issue<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.719> them

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
noticed a slight issue with some of them

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
noticed a slight issue with some of them
and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> within<00:00:55.890> every<00:00:56.100> system

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and I know that within every system

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.200 
and I know that within every system
there<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.300> anomalies<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> few<00:00:59.640> let

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there are anomalies so I have a few let

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.170 
there are anomalies so I have a few let
me<00:01:00.420> share<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
me share one of them with you so this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
me share one of them with you so this
lock<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.899> right<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.460> hairline<00:01:05.939> lock

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
lock is right here it's my hairline lock

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
lock is right here it's my hairline lock
and<00:01:08.030> although<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:10.290> thicker<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and although it's a bit thicker on the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
and although it's a bit thicker on the
bottom<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.320> have<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> weak<00:01:13.710> point<00:01:14.540> right<00:01:15.540> here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
bottom I have a weak point right here

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.300 
bottom I have a weak point right here
I'm<00:01:16.020> sure<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.850> right<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.229> so

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
I'm sure you can see it right here so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
I'm sure you can see it right here so
it's<00:01:20.310> thicker<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> top<00:01:21.360> thicker<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
it's thicker on the top thicker on the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's thicker on the top thicker on the
bottom<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.189> through<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
bottom and then right through here it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
bottom and then right through here it
thins<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.650> comparison<00:01:27.020> let<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.140> show

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thins out now in comparison let me show

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
thins out now in comparison let me show
you<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> thickness<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.170> locks<00:01:31.820> in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you the thickness of most of my locks in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.670 
you the thickness of most of my locks in
comparison<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
comparison to this one see that

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.210 
comparison to this one see that
so<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.939> thinner<00:01:39.299> already<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> has

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
so it's thinner already and then it has

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.380 
so it's thinner already and then it has
this<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:42.799> weak<00:01:43.799> point<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.030> gonna<00:01:45.149> need

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this very weak point so I'm gonna need

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
this very weak point so I'm gonna need
some<00:01:45.600> lock<00:01:45.810> repair<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> couple<00:01:47.220> more

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
some lock repair I have a couple more

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.210 
some lock repair I have a couple more
locks<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:48.659> well<00:01:49.220> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
locks that are like that as well that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
locks that are like that as well that
are<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.579> hair<00:01:51.329> line<00:01:51.540> locks<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.560> these

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
are all hair line locks that have these

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.080 
are all hair line locks that have these
little<00:01:52.920> weak<00:01:53.159> points<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.820> tend<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
little weak points in them I tend to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
little weak points in them I tend to
pull<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.390> hair<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.100> although

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
pull my hair up a lot and so although

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
pull my hair up a lot and so although
none<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:56.939> other<00:01:57.210> locks<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
none of my other locks really have this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
none of my other locks really have this
problem<00:01:58.380> I'd<00:01:58.680> say<00:01:58.890> probably<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.490> three<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
problem I'd say probably about three of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
problem I'd say probably about three of
mine<00:02:00.450> needs<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.320> repair<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.640> gonna<00:02:02.759> go

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
mine needs some repair so I'm gonna go

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300

routine<00:02:17.950> thing<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:18.370> all<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.570> want<00:02:19.750> some

routine thing at all is if you want some

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.040 
routine thing at all is if you want some

I<00:02:24.850> would<00:02:25.810> suggest<00:02:26.550> Moroccan<00:02:27.550> oil<00:02:28.020> now<00:02:29.020> it's<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
because the oil is very thick and it
