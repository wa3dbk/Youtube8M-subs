00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
the temperature here it is cold but what

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.980 
the temperature here it is cold but what
if<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.530> good<00:02:50.600> really<00:02:51.600> cool

if it's like really good really cool

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.740 
if it's like really good really cool
right

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
right

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:07.870 
right
what<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:54.990> very<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.620> cool

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.790 

call

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.270 

then<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:14.320> cold

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:31.690 

an<00:03:19.790> extremely<00:03:20.510> cold

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.440 

extremely<00:03:32.700> cold<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.470> also<00:03:34.710> say<00:03:35.450> super

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
extremely cold you can also say super

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:52.680 
extremely cold you can also say super
cold

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.930 

so<00:03:54.240> what<00:03:55.240> is<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.720> temperature<00:03:56.140> here<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:57.730> is

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
so what is the temperature here it is

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.140 
so what is the temperature here it is
cold<00:03:58.240> what<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.290> temperature<00:03:59.620> it<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.850> cold

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
cold what is the temperature it is cold

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.820 
cold what is the temperature it is cold
what<00:04:02.020> is<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.290> temperature<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:04.360> very<00:04:04.990> cold

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
what is the temperature it's very cold

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.640 
what is the temperature it's very cold
what<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.910> temperature<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:08.080> extremely

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
what is the temperature it's extremely

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.090 
what is the temperature it's extremely
cold<00:04:08.860> what's<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.850> temperature<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:11.200> super

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
cold what's the temperature it's super

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.370 
cold what's the temperature it's super
cold
