00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 but we are able to give 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.550
 plus 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.560
 not in accordance with the attitude of the team in 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 general throughout the match 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.000
 I think we can still give more than 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.400
 football aspect we face a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.400
 important selection of course 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.079
 and the second the second question that I 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.660
 you did and let's say a little bit because the 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.369
 team demonstrated certain station put 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.470
 accommodate us on the first day it cost us 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.850
 accommodate us then it was like giving us 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.710
 the mobility of them 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.300
 I believe that later with the running of 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.039
 match with the running of the match time 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.280
 we scored the goal and they drew in 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.710
 quickly and it was not hard to accommodate 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.659
 in terms of mobility that presented 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.399
 brazil then then gradually 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.949
 with the running of the minutes I did not sign 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.360
 accommodating better already in the second time 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.760
 we correct 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.970
 and we settled much better in the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.220
 match 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.470
 but I know but we have to correct them by 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.180
 Of course we have to improve in many 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 aspects we have to improve and 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 growing 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.119
 of thistle of the nights is arriving from 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.119
 radio ovation we are not live 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.970
 the morning for the theme of beauty is 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.350
 a theme of jefferson farfÃ¡n 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.540
 we want to know if there is any version 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.190
 official issue because I think it's over 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.440
 approving here so that you can 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.869
 include within those who initiated that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.990
 my first question and if the change is 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.860
 it must be just that you see it you see 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.740
 harmed by the problem I had in 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 the morning and the second about the change 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.490
 of vargas because it was missing very little is 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.080
 certainly no more runs much 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.909
 to enable the player but they end 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.899
 the plays ends just for that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.810
 side the theme of farfan is an allergy in 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 which he is being affected and when 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 he is not trying 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.159
 if it was doubt until the start of the match 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.219
 Then he tried it on and he answered 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219
 all right 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.429
 and is with some drawbacks 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.730
 then made a great effort and it 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.770
 consulted and well he was already there 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.750
 fulfilled all the effort that he 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.170
 that he demanded the vargas was a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.850
 change requested by him more than anything 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.860
 Of course there was little but good 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.440
 most important of all is also 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.060
 and preserve it as to preserve the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.270
 players like to come from the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.190
 better way because this does not end here 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.080
 regardless of what was important 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.390
 get a result now in the beginning 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.940
 so all we have two matches 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.620
 final ahead in which 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 We need players to come from 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.060
 the best way so good that was the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.130
 reason more than anything of the output there 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.130
 was the anger the sadness of the flank
