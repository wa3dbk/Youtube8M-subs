00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
has a two-way stretch that's going to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.819

stretch<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.399> left<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
stretch from left to right and then I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
stretch from left to right and then I
made<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> dart<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.719> then

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
made like a dart to go there and then

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.150 
made like a dart to go there and then
also<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.670> temple<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> added<00:00:48.480> another<00:00:48.629> piece

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
also in the temple I added another piece

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
also in the temple I added another piece
where<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.670> scratch<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> left<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
where it can scratch right to left and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
where it can scratch right to left and
then<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> side<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.399> scratch<00:00:53.760> right

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
then on this side we could scratch right

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
then on this side we could scratch right
to<00:00:54.300> left<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> only<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.039> I'm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
to left and then the only thing is I'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
to left and then the only thing is I'm
not<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> add<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.360> hair<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.710> dart

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
not going to add no hair in the dart

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
not going to add no hair in the dart
that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> added<00:01:00.090> into<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.199> she

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that I added into there because she

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
that I added into there because she
didn't<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.250> hair<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:03.239> modifying

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
didn't have any hair but we're modifying

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
didn't have any hair but we're modifying
it<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> fit<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.580> she's<00:01:06.299> not

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it to make it to fit if not she's not

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
able to fit it so that would be the way

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
able to fit it so that would be the way
that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.640> modify<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.600> cap<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:10.770> just

to<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> fact<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.240> back

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to see the fact that is you know back

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270 
to see the fact that is you know back
there<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> backwards<00:01:28.320> no<00:01:28.500> hit<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:28.979> hair

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
there in the backwards no hit no hair

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
there in the backwards no hit no hair
because<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.549> hair<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
because that hair on top is going to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
because that hair on top is going to
cover<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> future<00:01:32.880> she

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I sewed the darts in the back so this is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
I sewed the darts in the back so this is
the<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.350> weed<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.520> see

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the back of the weed so if you can see

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429 
the back of the weed so if you can see
right<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.060> hand<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.540> can't<00:01:51.810> tell<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.280 
missing hair but i'ma split it open and

that's why I added the mesh and if you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.399

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
can add hair back in here for her but at

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.780 
can add hair back in here for her but at
the<00:02:16.170> time<00:02:16.439> she<00:02:16.769> didn't<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.250> hair<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the time she didn't have the hair and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.789 
the time she didn't have the hair and
she<00:02:17.909> want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.329> have<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.629> ability<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:19.470> wear<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
wig so that's why I added the dart so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.440 
wig so that's why I added the dart so
hair<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.439> be<00:02:22.470> ventilated<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.489> here<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.239> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
hair can be ventilated in here so we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
hair can be ventilated in here so we
made<00:02:24.689> it<00:02:24.870> bigger<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.290> her<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.860> if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.099> can

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
made it bigger for her but if you can

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.539

then even from side to side
so<00:03:07.769> right<00:03:08.069> away<00:03:08.250> guys<00:03:08.670> don't<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.629> feel<00:03:09.900> like

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
so right away guys don't just feel like

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.559 
so right away guys don't just feel like
you<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.500> cut<00:03:10.799> these<00:03:11.010> wigs<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.970> scratch<00:03:12.329> in

you got to cut these wigs the scratch in

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.569 
you got to cut these wigs the scratch in
the<00:03:12.720> top<00:03:12.959> will<00:03:13.349> have<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> ability<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.129> do<00:03:14.400> that

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
the top will have the ability to do that

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.309 
the top will have the ability to do that
so<00:03:14.760> she<00:03:14.790> probably<00:03:15.150> could<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.689> fit<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.079> week

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
so she probably could have fit this week

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.860 
so she probably could have fit this week
and<00:03:16.920> she<00:03:17.099> just<00:03:17.459> inherited<00:03:18.120> down<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.629> didn't

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and she just inherited down and didn't

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.740 
and she just inherited down and didn't
pull<00:03:19.109> for<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.500> scratch<00:03:19.949> from<00:03:20.760> front<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.480> back

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
pull for the scratch from front to back

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.229 
pull for the scratch from front to back
and<00:03:21.989> from<00:03:22.349> ear<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:22.919> ear<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.609> does<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
and from ear to ear it does have the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.520 
and from ear to ear it does have the
ability<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.540> scratch<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.139> wouldn't<00:03:25.379> say

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
ability to scratch so I wouldn't say

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.400 
ability to scratch so I wouldn't say
right<00:03:25.769> away<00:03:25.919> just<00:03:26.849> just<00:03:27.449> think<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.199> won't

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
right away just just think that it won't

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.920 
right away just just think that it won't
fit<00:03:28.680> try<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.340> attach<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:30.090> down<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.480> give<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
fit try it attach it down and give the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.569 
fit try it attach it down and give the
scratch<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.769> attach<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.310> down

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
scratch you have to attach this down

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.490 
scratch you have to attach this down
first<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.599> once<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.989> get<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.349> where

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
first and then once you get it to where

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920 
first and then once you get it to where
you<00:03:34.620> want<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.949> then<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.250> pull<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.419> that'll<00:03:36.840> be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
you want it then you pull so that'll be

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.300 
you want it then you pull so that'll be
the<00:03:37.079> technique<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.709> probably<00:03:37.949> could

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
the technique because it probably could

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.069 
the technique because it probably could
have<00:03:38.400> fit<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:39.299> know<00:03:39.480> because<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.930> guys

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
have fit you know because if you guys

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.020 
have fit you know because if you guys
look<00:03:40.470> one<00:03:41.340> way<00:03:41.780> again<00:03:42.780> look<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.470> scratch

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
look one way again look at the scratch

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.969 
look one way again look at the scratch
look<00:03:45.030> how<00:03:45.150> far<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:45.479> stretches<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.859> she

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
look how far that stretches so she

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.189 
look how far that stretches so she
probably<00:03:47.250> had<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.819> ability<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.449> fit<00:03:48.989> this

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
probably had the ability to fit this

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.830 
probably had the ability to fit this
weed<00:03:49.409> without<00:03:49.889> cutting<00:03:50.609> those<00:03:50.760> darts<00:03:51.359> into<00:03:51.569> it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
weed without cutting those darts into it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.289 
weed without cutting those darts into it
so<00:03:52.229> I<00:03:52.620> modified<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.370> for<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:53.699> like<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.940> said<00:03:54.180> we

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
so I modified it for but like I said we

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.270 
so I modified it for but like I said we
didn't<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.750> hair<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.229> for<00:03:55.859> me<00:03:55.949> to<00:03:56.069> vent

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
didn't have the hair to for me to vent

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.039 
didn't have the hair to for me to vent
back<00:03:56.459> in<00:03:56.669> here<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:56.970> vent<00:03:57.180> back<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.569> there<00:03:57.750> so

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
back in here and vent back in there so

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.990 
back in here and vent back in there so
you<00:03:58.560> know<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:58.859> just<00:03:58.949> wearable<00:03:59.519> for<00:03:59.669> her<00:03:59.790> now

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
you know it's just wearable for her now
