00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.550 
back of home I really really love these
shoes<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.579> love<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> width<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.360> come<00:02:21.569> out<00:02:21.780> it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
shoes I love the width it come out it's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.220 
shoes I love the width it come out it's
so<00:02:22.799> pretty<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.579> me<00:02:25.190> these<00:02:26.190> shoes<00:02:27.230> range

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
so pretty to me these shoes range

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
so pretty to me these shoes range
different<00:02:28.739> prices<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.459> between<00:02:29.579> 400

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
different prices but it's between 400

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.110 
different prices but it's between 400
and<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.810> 450<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:32.819> regular

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and in like 450 you can get regular

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.000 
and in like 450 you can get regular
crystallized<00:02:33.900> crystals<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
crystallized crystals you don't have to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
crystallized crystals you don't have to
get<00:02:35.130> sworsky<00:02:35.370> crystals<00:02:36.000> because<00:02:36.329> really<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
get sworsky crystals because really the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
get sworsky crystals because really the
source<00:02:37.380> key<00:02:37.560> crystals<00:02:38.010> make<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.670> more

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
source key crystals make the it more

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.940 
source key crystals make the it more
money<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> source<00:02:40.140> source<00:02:40.769> key

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
money because the source source key

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.460 
money because the source source key
crystals<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:41.610> cheap<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.959> I'm<00:02:43.079> sure<00:02:43.290> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
crystals are not cheap and I'm sure you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
crystals are not cheap and I'm sure you
know<00:02:43.590> people<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.129> that<00:02:44.310> about<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> source

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
know people know that about the source

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.660 
know people know that about the source
key<00:02:45.180> crystals<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.400> were<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.549> give

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
key crystals so if you were to give

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.190 
key crystals so if you were to give
regular<00:02:47.819> crystallized<00:02:48.390> crystals<00:02:48.959> it'll

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
regular crystallized crystals it'll

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.000 
regular crystallized crystals it'll
probably<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.530> $100<00:02:50.130> less<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.650> will<00:02:52.769> still

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
probably be $100 less and it will still

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.490 
probably be $100 less and it will still
be<00:02:53.040> blingy<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.239> won't<00:02:54.359> be<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.690> blinky

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
be blingy but it just won't be as blinky

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.090 
be blingy but it just won't be as blinky
as<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.859> source<00:02:56.130> key<00:02:56.340> crystals<00:02:57.859> these<00:02:58.859> are<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
as the source key crystals these are the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.660 
as the source key crystals these are the
shoes<00:03:00.170> our<00:03:01.170> picture<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> back<00:03:01.889> you<00:03:02.489> guys
