00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 in fact as I drive in traffic well kolis 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.769
 driving I decided to record you a video 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 video because time is pity and thought 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.109
 the good one appeared therefore shaking 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 arm 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.010
 if you are confused then you can 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 don't look at the picture but just listen 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.160

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 in the winter 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 waking up caught myself thinking that well 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 don't feel like getting up and somehow lazy and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.280
 now get up wash your hair dry 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 on the edge of the scenes overall commit mass 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.899
 manipulations before actually 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.430
 get to work at all get out 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.950
 Autumn apartments I needed early 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 leave the apartment I understand that something like 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.770
 in general, it's all creepy and I want to stay 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.050
 bed do not want to do anything but laziness 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.809
 winning people watching me from cars 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.770

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.240
 ok so here i want to tell you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 in one game which i am for myself 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 came up and play it then when 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.119
 I have such a state when I wake up 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.590
 and now I somehow do not want 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.600
 something to do i think about who and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.830
 Today 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.110
 explain what it means that today I 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.610
 coming up with some kind of a role 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.470
 sexual nature of course I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.140
 a nurse or someone else even she and she 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 also not bad I invent myself a role from 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.880
 the person I like in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.130
 the moment but there for example today 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.710

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.840
 need to go out and and a hollywood star there 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.400
 here paparazzi around start to get used to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.380
 some kind of image and immediately becomes 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.200
 I wonder what she thinks 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.509
 interesting breakfast that's how it washes 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.800
 hair how does it fit you not 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.409
 expression delirium 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.890
 I'm practically in the dark here today 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.550
 this mole is the main character of the movie mole 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.320
 here and this is cool it turns me on 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.560
 the game cheers me up and 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.650
 Actually, I do not notice how, but I already have everything 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 made and leave here as I leave now 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.340
 on the surface I go out 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.110
 great mood and proper 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.209
 sometimes even this game continues with me 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.709
 when I communicate with the staff here 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.610
 especially when I go with them 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 unhealthy not even so general it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.190
 fun and cool so this 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.480
 wonderful advice it seems to me he is to you 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.380
 will play into your hand that's if you 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.540
 take advantage of 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.209
 and in some situations certain 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.120
 when you find yourself thinking what if 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.440
 Today, for example, I can play 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.049
 your chalky if you have any 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.269
 problems with customers or weddings or 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.340
 with contractors behave like you 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.730
 suppose I would behave for example 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.680
 it's fun play enjoy here 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.500
 the most important thing is always find ways 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.570
 in order to look great 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.340

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.480
