progressed<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.180> think<00:05:06.360> we<00:05:06.450> all<00:05:07.430> sort<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.490> took

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
progressed I think we all sort of took

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.029 
progressed I think we all sort of took
it<00:05:08.640> upon<00:05:08.880> ourselves<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.300> try<00:05:09.600> harder<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.200> push

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
it upon ourselves to try harder and push

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.969 
it upon ourselves to try harder and push
we<00:05:11.280> kind<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.820> don't<00:05:12.479> know<00:05:12.630> if<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:12.900> didn't<00:05:13.890> get

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979

personally I get like super nervous

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.219 
personally I get like super nervous
before<00:05:49.789> my<00:05:49.849> first<00:05:50.030> grader<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.419> meat<00:05:50.569> first

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
before my first grader the meat first

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.629 
before my first grader the meat first
race<00:05:51.470> of<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.650> meat<00:05:51.800> because<00:05:52.039> I<00:05:52.099> kind<00:05:52.250> of<00:05:52.370> I

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
race of the meat because I kind of I

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.790 
race of the meat because I kind of I
guess<00:05:53.090> sets<00:05:53.509> the<00:05:53.630> tone<00:05:53.810> for<00:05:53.870> how<00:05:54.410> I'm<00:05:54.590> going<00:05:54.740> to

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
guess sets the tone for how I'm going to

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.309 
guess sets the tone for how I'm going to
feel<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.069> rest<00:05:55.220> of<00:05:55.340> meat<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:56.180> once<00:05:56.690> i<00:05:56.840> went<00:05:57.199> out

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
feel the rest of meat so once i went out

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.710 
feel the rest of meat so once i went out
and<00:05:57.380> freedoms<00:05:57.830> I<00:05:57.919> just<00:05:58.069> went<00:05:58.220> for<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:59.360> I

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
and freedoms I just went for it and I

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.390 
and freedoms I just went for it and I
had<00:05:59.840> one<00:06:00.110> of<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.229> best<00:06:00.319> time<00:06:00.500> drop<00:06:00.860> little

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
had one of the best time drop little

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.610 
had one of the best time drop little
over<00:06:01.669> half<00:06:01.819> a<00:06:01.910> second<00:06:02.300> so<00:06:03.169> I<00:06:03.199> was<00:06:03.319> happy<00:06:03.380> with

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
over half a second so I was happy with
