me off on a roll and we did start to
score<00:02:20.390> some<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:21.920> more<00:02:22.099> important<00:02:22.580> goals

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
double tap square cross I think it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.600

really<00:02:31.909> sort<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.569> under<00:02:32.900> used<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.349> well<00:02:33.560> well<00:02:33.739> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
really sort of under used as well well a

really sort of under used as well well a
lot<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.280> people<00:02:34.459> really<00:02:34.610> don't<00:02:34.970> think<00:02:35.269> it's

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
lot of people really don't think it's

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.809 
lot of people really don't think it's
that<00:02:36.080> good<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.620> effective<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.310> really<00:02:37.640> is

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
that good and effective but it really is

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.600 
that good and effective but it really is
a<00:02:37.849> few<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.330> use<00:02:38.890> square<00:02:39.890> or<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.280> don't<00:02:40.519> know

what it is an Xbox controller i'm good
at<00:02:42.140> near<00:02:42.319> me<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.180> double<00:02:44.480> tap<00:02:44.599> it

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
at near me but if you just double tap it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.270 
at near me but if you just double tap it
when<00:02:45.290> you're<00:02:45.440> sort<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.829> near<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> boss

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
when you're sort of like near the boss

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.100 
when you're sort of like near the boss
instead<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.730> crossing<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> air<00:02:47.659> you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
instead of crossing it in in the air you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.420 
instead of crossing it in in the air you
just<00:02:48.290> do<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.379> on<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> ground<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.310> will

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
just do it on the ground and it will

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.520 
just do it on the ground and it will
create<00:02:49.670> am<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.569> really<00:02:50.840> sort<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.230> hard

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
create am just a really sort of hard

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.770 
create am just a really sort of hard
powered<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.030> cross<00:02:53.329> along<00:02:53.629> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
powered and you know cross along the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.180 
powered and you know cross along the
floor<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.200> means<00:02:54.349> your<00:02:54.650> players<00:02:54.920> can<00:02:55.099> get

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
floor and it means your players can get

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.009 
floor and it means your players can get
there<00:02:55.310> quicker<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.849> get<00:02:56.239> into<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.480> far<00:02:56.780> post

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
there quicker and get into the far post

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.740 
there quicker and get into the far post
and<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.829> it's<00:02:57.980> pretty<00:02:58.129> pretty<00:02:58.970> effective<00:02:59.480> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and so it's pretty pretty effective and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.900 
and so it's pretty pretty effective and
obviously<00:03:00.109> you<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.829> us<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.250> been<00:03:01.489> it's
