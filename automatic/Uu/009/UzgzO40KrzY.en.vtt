00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.640
 Yes Hello everyone is often this time to introduce how to format the hard drive 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.430
 I would like 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 Let's connect the drive we want to format at first 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 In this case I bought Teller's usb drive to this , so I want to format it first 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 I think 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.290
 Connect the drive and go to Disk Utility 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.770
 Finder application for disk utility 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.180
 Go with Utility Disk Utility 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 Disk Utility allows you to see all the drives connected to your Mac 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 so 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 Find and click on the drive you just connected and hit the erase button 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.750
 This way you can format it here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.850
 There are many types of formats and can be divided into three 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.710
 Let's briefly explain the position there are advantages and disadvantages to each of the format 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:10.360
 Mac os extended Well then I ring at the top is a Mac-only format 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 With this format, you can only read and write using a Mac, so with a pc 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.409
 can not use 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.399
 In other words , it becomes the drive only for Mac 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.259
 The other three formats under the tree are identical 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:28.010
 However, unless you are using an old bag, it will be in this old format. 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:32.150
 It is all right at the top journaling 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:37.280
 So instead of the Let's Do mac expert take a look at the following format: 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.380
 If you want to drive compatible with both mac and pc this ms dos 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.340
 Let's pad 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.560
 That the beginning is in this format and roughly buy a new hard drive 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 Although there are many, the good part of this format is mac and pc compatible, so both 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.680
 Machine can read and write files 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 However, when it says in the fault, file size is limited 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.470
 One file can not be used with the ki becomes abnormal 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.540
 In other words, if you can read and write only the following files with mac and pc support 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.420
 This format is recommended 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.360
 Well, what is the last format of this ? This is the new one I recommend most 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.800
 The format is ex pad 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 The nice thing about this format is yet compatible with both mac and pc 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 There is a good and bad thing that you can use anything with almost no attention because the file size is limited 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.200
 given that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.560
 Remember that ex pad is a relatively new format and can not be used on older machines 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.130
 Let's get up 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.330
 Mac If the fee Per etc. It is not handled in the following machine 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:46.520
 Please be careful because you can not use windows xp with pc 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.430
 In my case, I don't use an old machine so much, so I would like to make this ex at 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.060
 I will 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.020
 Once the format is decided, give it a name 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 Please press the gavel button 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.270
 When a hard drive is formatted, all data in it will be erased 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.070
 Try to not masu of the precious files 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.610
 If there is, it is recommended to stop and immediately back up 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.770
 If it does not exist, press the å–¬ button once more. 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:19.080
 Format starts 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:22.640
 You do it by removing the drive in the viewfinder after format is completed by dividing 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.640
 Please consult removed in the only 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:33.030
 Yes this time it sounds like this Please ask in the comments below if you have any questions 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.030
 Then goodbye
