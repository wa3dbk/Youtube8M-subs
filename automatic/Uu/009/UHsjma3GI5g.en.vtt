00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.160 

once<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.940> reaches<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.420> safe<00:02:41.630> temperature<00:02:41.870> of

211<00:02:42.680> degrees<00:02:43.010> rinse<00:02:43.940> cycle<00:02:44.360> will<00:02:44.510> curve<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
211 degrees rinse cycle will curve and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.840 
211 degrees rinse cycle will curve and
the<00:02:45.530> rinse<00:02:45.770> cycle<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:48.340> basically<00:02:49.340> washing

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
the rinse cycle is basically washing

the rinse cycle is basically washing

right here in about a second there's a
