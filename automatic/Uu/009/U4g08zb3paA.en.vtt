because<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.890> 100<00:01:08.310> pluses<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.000> me

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
because I like 100 pluses don't get me

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
because I like 100 pluses don't get me
wrong<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.650> there's<00:01:10.650> nothing<00:01:11.070> better<00:01:11.310> than<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
wrong but there's nothing better than a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980 
wrong but there's nothing better than a
sniping<00:01:11.880> gameplay<00:01:12.030> look<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> taking

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
sniping gameplay look at this taking

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.480 
sniping gameplay look at this taking
these<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.100> nothing

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
these guys out there's just nothing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
these guys out there's just nothing
better<00:01:14.700> than<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.990> sniping

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
better than this I think that sniping

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280 
better than this I think that sniping
takes<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> skill<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.930> only<00:01:19.080> people

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
takes a lot of skill the only people

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.359 
takes a lot of skill the only people
that<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.710> dozen<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.040> people<00:01:20.280> who

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that say that a dozen are people who

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.850 
that say that a dozen are people who
don't<00:01:20.549> do<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> necessarily<00:01:21.299> sure<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
don't do it necessarily sure can you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
bigger guys does that make sense so it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.710

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.360 
the first step into the big leagues
15,000<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.230> biggest<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> small<00:02:53.189> guys

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
15,000 is the biggest of the small guys

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.399 
15,000 is the biggest of the small guys
the<00:02:53.669> smallest<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.239> big<00:02:54.389> eyes<00:02:54.510> 15,000<00:02:55.200> subs

the smallest of the big eyes 15,000 subs

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.610 
the smallest of the big eyes 15,000 subs
is<00:02:55.620> where<00:02:56.450> channels<00:02:57.450> start<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.079> take<00:02:58.230> off<00:02:58.379> in

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
is where channels start to take off in
