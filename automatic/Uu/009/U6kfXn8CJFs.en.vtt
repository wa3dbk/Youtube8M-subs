00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.180
 I have been true ie I am really 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.220
 satisfied with the purchase 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.900
 shipping was in one day with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 free shipping I don't even know of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 precise because I didn't have the first one at least 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 I do not think so really boh 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 really glad i bought this 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 model compared to others because he had 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.629
 also the shocking mount included in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 price 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 and also the cable that passes inside 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 of the frame so you don't need to have it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.800
 the cable really punches great 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 excellent for a moment 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.690
 I'm not so much I did n't unbox 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.460
 indeed I show you is really 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.520
 well protected both the packaging in addition to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 this was cardboard packaging 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.479
 classic of amazon expeditions 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 anonymous brown and packaging 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.020
 really soft and protects in a way 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.210
 perfect 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 they were all perfectly separated 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.340
 there were no more pieces inside 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.380
 so there was the shocking mount 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.979
 adaptable to both large threads 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 that the small one the base one with 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 the clamp to attach it to the table e 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 then the folding pole with already revenue 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.250
 inside it's really comfortable it's long 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 40 cm arm and extension 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 total of about 80 centimeters per 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 convenience now of live video everything 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.130
 how much I can move it if I don't need it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.149
 more can bear 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.680
 have it in the middle and despite it too 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.420
 when I keep it in front of me I can still 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.470
 to see the monitor on the left without 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.570
 problems 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.340
 I can adjust it in all positions 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.259
 that may interest me 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.140
 now I don't know whether to use the audio from 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.700
 this microphone or the road after a 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.380
 moment decide I want to see a moment 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.149
 and I have to do some tests too 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.910
 absolutely satisfied with the purchase 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.860
 if you need to buy an arm 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.769
 extensible I recommend it 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.769
 absolutely especially if you need the 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.019
 fitting for let's say with rubber bands 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.640
 absolutely antishock assembly 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.780
 glad I remind you that I leave you the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.880
 link in description if you want 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.010
 there were others to buy it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.080
 assessors I have to decide one thing if 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.239
 use or filter what goes 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.099
 forward or use the classic there 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.290
 the pop filter caused so far short 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.760
 before I had the other one then used this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 because it was more comfortable for me 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.349
 practically indirectly to cover 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.720
 I don't know actually I saw that pop 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.920
 filter is not really necessary though 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.450
 we see 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.970
 let me know what it sounds like 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.790
 this auction absolutely for the price 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.140
 absolutely worth it and nothing 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.519
 guys for this video too 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.049
 if I liked it and left me like 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.549
 let me know what you think if you don't 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.930
 liked the choice I do not like in 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.700
