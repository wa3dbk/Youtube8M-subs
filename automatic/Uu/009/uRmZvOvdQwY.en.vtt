00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
through that cake flat-out you really do

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.580 
through that cake flat-out you really do
have<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.150> grow<00:06:01.420> a<00:06:01.450> pair<00:06:01.720> before<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.230> drive<00:06:02.440> the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
have to grow a pair before you drive the

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.760 
have to grow a pair before you drive the
car<00:06:02.620> like<00:06:02.950> this<00:06:03.190> on<00:06:03.880> a<00:06:03.940> track<00:06:04.240> like<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.770> with

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
car like this on a track like this with

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.820 
car like this on a track like this with
any<00:06:05.920> kind<00:06:06.220> of<00:06:06.280> proper<00:06:06.640> commitment<00:06:07.830> it's

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
any kind of proper commitment it's

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.870 
any kind of proper commitment it's
pretty<00:06:09.130> good<00:06:09.310> through<00:06:09.580> the<00:06:09.700> chicane<00:06:10.060> but

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
pretty good through the chicane but

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.910 
pretty good through the chicane but
I<00:06:11.970> don't<00:06:12.660> think<00:06:12.720> the<00:06:12.960> front<00:06:13.080> end<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.530> as<00:06:13.650> pinned

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
I don't think the front end is as pinned

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.710 
I don't think the front end is as pinned
as<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.220> estin<00:06:14.550> see<00:06:14.880> what<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.120> time<00:06:15.330> is<00:06:15.360> and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
as the estin see what the time is and

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.440 
as the estin see what the time is and
see<00:06:15.960> what<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.470> time<00:06:16.770> is<00:06:16.800> I<00:06:17.310> think<00:06:17.970> it's<00:06:18.330> going

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
see what the time is I think it's going

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.200 
see what the time is I think it's going
to<00:06:18.510> be<00:06:18.570> very<00:06:18.900> very<00:06:19.350> close<00:06:22.610> see<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.640> can't<00:06:23.940> get<00:06:24.060> my
