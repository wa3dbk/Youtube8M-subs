degree I can't like kinda just put it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
degree I can't like kinda just put it
directly<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.899> top<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.430> long<00:00:53.460> as

I<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.570> pixel<00:00:55.020> space<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I have like one pixel space like if I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.049 
I have like one pixel space like if I
try<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.039> behind<00:00:56.280> Twinkie<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> should<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.000> able

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
try go behind Twinkie I should be able

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.080

to it and I can even sometimes I have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
to it and I can even sometimes I have
like<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.570> pixel<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> edge<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
like one pixel over to the edge of this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.290 
like one pixel over to the edge of this
I<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.399> actually<00:01:02.430> place<00:01:02.789> them<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:03.030> top<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I can actually place them over top of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.210 
I can actually place them over top of
that<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.409> place<00:01:04.650> them<00:01:04.890> on
