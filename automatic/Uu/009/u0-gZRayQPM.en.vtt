00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
so I've already tuned in to this person

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.180 
so I've already tuned in to this person
I've<00:00:41.860> already<00:00:42.370> doused<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.960> colors<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.890> there

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190

are four colors there are usually four

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.850 
are four colors there are usually four
colors<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.700> when<00:00:48.970> I<00:00:49.000> douse<00:00:49.650> probably<00:00:50.650> around

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
colors but when I douse probably around

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.790 
colors but when I douse probably around
ten<00:00:51.310> colors<00:00:51.730> come<00:00:52.270> up<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.620> what's

of<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.200> butterfly<00:01:26.860> fairy<00:01:27.730> energy<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
of a butterfly fairy energy and that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.880 
of a butterfly fairy energy and that
came<00:01:29.890> as<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.280> purple<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.440> purple<00:01:32.440> is<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
came as the purple and purple is the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.180 
came as the purple and purple is the
color<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.840> transformation<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:35.080> change<00:01:35.620> and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
color of transformation of change and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.540 
color of transformation of change and
butterflies<00:01:37.030> reflect<00:01:38.190> transformation<00:01:39.190> going

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
butterflies reflect transformation going

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.719 
butterflies reflect transformation going
from<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.850> caterpillar<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> butterfly

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
from the caterpillar to a butterfly

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.870 
from the caterpillar to a butterfly
so<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.539> tells<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> she<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.680> opening<00:01:44.280> up

very<00:02:25.650> tidy<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.549> inside<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.239> then<00:02:27.390> tidy<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
very tidy on the inside and then tidy on

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.309 
very tidy on the inside and then tidy on
the<00:02:28.079> outside<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.420> third<00:02:30.690> color<00:02:31.049> that's

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the outside the third color that's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.740 
the outside the third color that's
coming<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:32.099> called<00:02:32.400> Sun<00:02:32.730> yellow<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
coming in is called Sun yellow and I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.130 
coming in is called Sun yellow and I
felt<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:35.250> needed<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.730> sprayed<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:37.019> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
felt it needed to be sprayed on just a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:59.640 
felt it needed to be sprayed on just a
little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.500> sprayed<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.130> at<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.519> time

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.910 

and<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:00.980> final<00:03:01.459> color<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.390> canary<00:03:03.230> yellow

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and now the final color is canary yellow

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.150 
and now the final color is canary yellow
and<00:03:04.270> as<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.360> say<00:03:05.569> yellow<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.290> violet<00:03:06.650> purple

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
and as I say yellow and violet purple

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.630 
and as I say yellow and violet purple
are<00:03:07.610> opposite<00:03:08.300> each<00:03:08.480> other<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:10.400> almost

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
are opposite each other so it's almost

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.820 
are opposite each other so it's almost
as<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.150> she<00:03:11.209> has<00:03:11.660> gone<00:03:11.900> inside<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.650> herself

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
as if she has gone inside of herself

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.500 
as if she has gone inside of herself
she's<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.940> through<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> deep

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
she's going through a deep

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.470 
she's going through a deep
transformation<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.489> yellow<00:03:16.880> is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
transformation and now this yellow is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.190 
transformation and now this yellow is
bringing<00:03:18.080> her<00:03:18.260> out<00:03:18.790> opposite<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:20.000> violet<00:03:20.630> so

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
bringing her out opposite that violet so

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.780 
bringing her out opposite that violet so
the<00:03:21.319> yellow<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.650> joy<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:23.209> no<00:03:24.050> boundaries<00:03:24.790> so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
the yellow is joy it's no boundaries so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.180 
the yellow is joy it's no boundaries so
the<00:03:26.030> yellow<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.420> outside<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.230> lines<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.950> it's

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the yellow is outside the lines and it's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.100 
the yellow is outside the lines and it's
inside<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.849> lines<00:03:29.060> just<00:03:29.269> like<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> purple<00:03:29.959> is

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
inside the lines just like the purple is

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.220 
inside the lines just like the purple is
it's<00:03:30.860> almost<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.400> she<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.930> through

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
it's almost like she is going through

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.360 
it's almost like she is going through
deep<00:03:34.010> shifts<00:03:34.549> deep<00:03:34.760> changes<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:37.190> from

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
deep shifts deep changes and going from

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.670 
deep shifts deep changes and going from
this<00:03:37.670> caterpillar<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> butterfly<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
this caterpillar to a butterfly and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.830 
this caterpillar to a butterfly and
she's<00:03:40.400> being<00:03:40.610> set<00:03:40.910> free<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:41.750> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
she's being set free there's a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.970 
she's being set free there's a
liberation<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.860> this<00:03:43.069> energy<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:44.709> felt<00:03:45.709> that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
liberation in this energy I felt that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.580 
liberation in this energy I felt that
then<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> wanted<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.849> spray<00:03:47.360> more<00:03:47.750> yellow<00:03:48.290> more

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
then I wanted to spray more yellow more

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.800 
then I wanted to spray more yellow more
the<00:03:48.830> Sun<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.480> interesting

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the Sun on there and it's interesting

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.500 
the Sun on there and it's interesting
that<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.260> called<00:03:51.530> Sun<00:03:51.860> yellow<00:03:52.330> because<00:03:53.330> the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that it's called Sun yellow because the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.400 
that it's called Sun yellow because the
butterfly

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
butterfly

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.199 
butterfly
maybe<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:55.040> butterfly<00:03:55.519> would<00:03:55.700> be<00:03:55.849> reaching

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
maybe the butterfly would be reaching

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.559 
maybe the butterfly would be reaching
for<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.450> Sun<00:03:56.720> or<00:03:57.459> maybe<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.640> would<00:03:58.760> be<00:03:58.790> basking

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
for the Sun or maybe it would be basking

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.130 
for the Sun or maybe it would be basking
in<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.989> Sun<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.560> because<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.519> sunlight<00:04:02.140> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
in the Sun and because that sunlight and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.370 
in the Sun and because that sunlight and
my<00:04:03.530> mother<00:04:03.769> used<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.980> say<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.640> Sun<00:04:04.910> is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
my mother used to say that the Sun is

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.610 
my mother used to say that the Sun is
the<00:04:06.380> physical<00:04:06.739> body<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.400> Great<00:04:07.640> Spirit<00:04:08.620> so

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the physical body of a Great Spirit so

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.940 
the physical body of a Great Spirit so
there<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.239> desire<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.269> reach<00:04:11.810> up<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.829> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
there is a desire to reach up to the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:33.450 
there is a desire to reach up to the
spiritual<00:04:13.459> consciousness

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.239 

here<00:04:34.460> I'm<00:04:34.610> putting<00:04:34.639> some<00:04:35.210> salt<00:04:35.680> into<00:04:36.680> an<00:04:36.800> area

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
here I'm putting some salt into an area

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.760 
here I'm putting some salt into an area
that<00:04:37.309> I<00:04:37.520> felt<00:04:37.909> wanted<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.479> have<00:04:38.629> salt<00:04:39.020> on<00:04:39.319> and

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that I felt wanted to have salt on and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.920 
that I felt wanted to have salt on and
it<00:04:40.219> kind<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> becomes<00:04:40.819> a<00:04:41.089> little<00:04:41.210> X<00:04:41.629> it's

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
it kind of becomes a little X it's

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.779 
it kind of becomes a little X it's
almost<00:04:42.199> like<00:04:42.349> x<00:04:42.620> marks<00:04:43.189> the<00:04:43.279> spot

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
almost like x marks the spot

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.329 
almost like x marks the spot
and<00:04:44.330> then<00:04:45.139> some<00:04:45.439> of<00:04:45.469> the<00:04:45.650> salt<00:04:45.919> crystals

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:46.339 
and then some of the salt crystals

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.989 
and then some of the salt crystals
wanted<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.939> go<00:04:47.259> in<00:04:48.259> other<00:04:48.800> areas<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.729> silk

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
wanted to go in other areas of the silk

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.179 
wanted to go in other areas of the silk
as<00:04:50.210> well<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:50.599> not<00:04:50.749> everywhere<00:04:51.409> was<00:04:52.009> just

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
as well but not everywhere was just

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.510 
as well but not everywhere was just
specific<00:04:52.879> places<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.589> go<00:04:54.800> with<00:04:55.069> what<00:04:55.279> feels

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
specific places and I go with what feels

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.839 
specific places and I go with what feels
right<00:04:56.319> at<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.589> time<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.309> it<00:04:58.339> looks<00:04:58.580> like<00:04:58.729> I

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
right at the time so it looks like I

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.239 
right at the time so it looks like I
have<00:04:58.999> an<00:04:59.089> idea<00:04:59.599> of<00:04:59.809> what<00:04:59.960> I'm<00:05:00.139> doing<00:05:00.469> but<00:05:00.650> but<00:05:01.219> I

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
have an idea of what I'm doing but but I

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.389 
have an idea of what I'm doing but but I
I<00:05:01.580> don't<00:05:01.879> I<00:05:02.479> just<00:05:02.930> just<00:05:03.529> go<00:05:03.800> with<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.279> energy

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:04.399 
I don't I just just go with the energy

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:07.209 
I don't I just just go with the energy
go<00:05:04.999> with<00:05:05.270> whatever<00:05:05.809> wants<00:05:06.469> to<00:05:06.620> come<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:07.039> that

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
go with whatever wants to come in that

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.420 
go with whatever wants to come in that
moment<00:05:08.139> so<00:05:09.139> you<00:05:09.199> can<00:05:09.319> see<00:05:09.499> the<00:05:09.830> silk<00:05:10.099> looks

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
moment so you can see the silk looks

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.179 
moment so you can see the silk looks
fairly<00:05:10.759> dark<00:05:11.270> at<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.289> moment<00:05:12.710> with<00:05:12.949> all<00:05:12.979> the

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
fairly dark at the moment with all the
