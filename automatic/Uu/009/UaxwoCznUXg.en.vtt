 they perform 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.949
 the cold porcelain then 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.089
 we are going to notice the materials that we will need for that task 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 closer to climbing

 yellow benteke ar 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.760
 the first step let's acquire take the clay pot 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730
 we are going to paint it 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.970
 or the latex paint in the desired color 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 not in this case they chose 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.450
 we got to spend a few weeks of painting 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 so that it is completely covered 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 then we will also paint the inner part 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.860
 let's dry 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.390
 we got to pass the second 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.369
 and third coat of paint 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.679
 always leaving time interval for this team 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.179
 painting instruments etc 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.739
 goodbye to take 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.839
 these policies 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.009
 d foam as you see 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.799
 let's cut in half 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.699
 and the fly fit 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.239
 in the pot 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.699
 so that we can reverse it 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.289
 the joke that they will possess affirmed 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.439
 ita flowers zamora by the way in mind very simple to make 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.719
 we are going to 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.930
 take the dough 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.260
 and cut it with molds that can be those of kitchen or in your own 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.959
 for parties to girls 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.699
 let's prepare the dough first of all 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.189
 placing 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.359
 a little paint aol and me 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.119
 or it can also be fabric paint 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.119
 of desired color let's give it white base 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.819
 and then we will choose 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.919
 the other color the white we always place it 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.269
 so that once the porcelain dries 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.869
 does not want a transparent appearance 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.249
 because this material as it is when making glue 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.249
 vinyl we can stay 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.089
 that aspect and there is not a good ending is not nice 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.699
 let's put another tone 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.999
 We were going again and kneading 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.509
 until arriving 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.509
 to a uniform tone 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.919
 so 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.919
 we preserve the mass we have been working with NATO 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.019
 let's use 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 the roller 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.309
 We are going to be about two to three millimeters 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 high in the dough and taking the mold 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.729
 let's cut 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.839
 - a bowling office 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.620
 let's in the middle 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.379
 push it 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.379
 so that the flower that with this format quique 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.409
 so on 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.409
 let's go all cutting 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.470
 and in the middle we pushed we have the flower pro 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.629
 then here that we are going to perform 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.249
 let's move on 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.249
 the white tail collarini indicates 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.529
 in all the parts 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.669
 of this round 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.669
 we were going to start apeha the flowers 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.249
 I put in a sequence the horns push a little 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.110
 It was the bolillo himself 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.759
 so that they stick together 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.389
 try to fit one petal with another so that the white part 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.339
 do not appear 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.009
 if you who can also mix it 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.889
 there is no party 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.229
 and so on 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.039
 then in the part 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.039
 top too 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.729
 let's throw 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.469
 It's easier when the masseuse is still wet 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.169
 because you can press with the bolillo 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.199
 and stuck 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.199
 in easier ways 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.500
 they would have to 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 totally 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.139
 they think it's like the apple and it's already 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.949
 humberto dÃ­az is much easier 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.460
 to work 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.909
 This is a very easy job to do 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.680
 and this one can 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.680
 place a tape below the masista 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.550
 with the name of the honoree 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.619
 with a card and so on they want a 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:00.639
 very nice dreams 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.639
 it's about a few months 

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:08.400
 sund down 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.589
 very easy to perform 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.589
 and apart it is very economical too 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.659
 so he took advantage then 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.849
 is more eta jorge and in bali 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.869
 why flowers are very nice 

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:45.869
 and you can give it there 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:51.210
 you can put several per cent also as centerpiece if you wish 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.979
 doing it for a pot a little bit bigger than there was a nice one and it's 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.030
 very simple to make forms or experiences 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.150
 you write them live aeg that appears at the end of your screen now we go wrong 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.700
 that we sat saying goodbye to the network program
