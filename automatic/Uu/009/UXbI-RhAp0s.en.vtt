00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 cottage we're going to need 2 liters of 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.630
 Water 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.500

 a teaspoon of cinnamon powder 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.029
 and half a cup of sugar we are ready 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.860
 there good because here I have water 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.430
 the water that I previously started 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.230
 to warm 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.820
 here I will add sugar and cinnamon 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.980
 this is where we are going to cook 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.870
 our pears or can also be 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.239
 apples any of the two fruits 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.909
 are wonderful we are going to put and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.640
 also cinnamon if they are really in 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.870
 a diet regimen and do not want to eat 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.579
 sugar 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.440
 sugar azumi good can use 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.479
 low calorie sugar or some 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.610
 sugar substitute that is going to give you that 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.229
 voice and all of this recipe but it's going to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.180
 lower calories substantially like this 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.129
 is that good this is another option we are going to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 put here our pears or our 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.759
 apples I want you to see these pears and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.549
 let's add the slightly is very 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.530
 easy and there are two options here the first 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.020
 option is to add them where they are still 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.790
 raw and the second is agua carlos a 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.409
 Once they are cooked if they are already 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 cooked the pears and we will add them 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.579
 Making it easier easier 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.200
 because they are soft but good 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.750
 it can break them with great ease if 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.180
 is not to be very careful with that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.880
 good use of course the pulp 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
 to mix it in the cheese drops is the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.540
 Pulp will not be thrown away but more 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.130
 well we are going to mix it of course 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.020
 let's go here hollowed out disheartening 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.909
 in principle our pears with a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.159
 disheartening is something quite simple 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.810
 let's get it out now 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.620
 I do not want to get to the bottom 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.130
 because yes no 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.390
 and there they are 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.420
 it's ready 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.220
 we have here the heart of the pear and what 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.810
 only thing that we are going to do now is like a 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.690
 knife try to apply them a bit 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.060
 more so that it looks good because the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.970
 stuffed cheese with a side with a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.380
 knife let's go here hollow out we're going to 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.380
 finish opening our pear trying to 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.480
 remove nothing but the top part we're going 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.960
 to take a spoon and let's go here 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.910
 hollow the inside part little by little 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.819
 in this list 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:39.460
 we remove the pulp and go now 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.320
 we already have the stones hollowed out here 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.410
 also remove here a little more of the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.410
 blame the center the little seeds 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.820
 perfect costs a little more than 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.970
 work especially when they are raw that 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.440
 we have them here peeled 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.440
 let's take the center 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.870
 perfect and good because that's how we're going to 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.730
 occupy our pears the other way as 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.070
 I told them it's good I'm going to put it here 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.590
 our pears to be softened already 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.390
 cupped the other way as I said 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.860
 it is of course to sew them first and 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.800
 then increase which is very much 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 simpler and so we take advantage of the pulp 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.210
 of the pear but you have to have a lot 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.950
 more careful in water carlos because we are 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.550
 they can break up with great 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.290
 ease 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.710
 we already have then that they are 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.390
 cooking here in the boiling water that 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.820
 they submerge well that the oil bit 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.210
 of water so that they submerge and that 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.460
 cook all the couples are already 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.680
 ready and what we have left is really 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.720
 Now mix the cottage cheese 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.550
 we already have here the cottage cheese is one 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.160
 of the cheeses lower in fat than 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 we have can be cottage cheese also from 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.950
 cottage cheese is an option if you do not like 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.530
 the cottage cheese if you prefer cottage cheese 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.590
 you are from cottage cheese now this mixture 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.420
 can be short cheese with fruits or 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.850
 with the pulp of the pear or apple 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.310
 or as we are going to do here 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.580
 let's put a little 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.190
 of cinnamon a little sugar or substitute 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.319
 of sugar and practically is already 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.230
 our fill is missing a few 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.389
 minutes for our classes 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.220
 soften a little in the water 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.490
 we are already serving there 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.660
 and we are going to serve our dishes 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 here we have our chicken ready 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.120
 you see the wonderful truth already 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.130
 softened the germ let's put it by 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.230
 here and we're going to serve it with the rice 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.450
 steam is something very simple and goes perfect 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.560
 what also the rice with the sauce 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 soy see nothing else what so rich thing 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.610
 that such kids crave even if 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.729
 of light although it is a dietetic saint 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.740
 game 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.059
 there we are going to put a little more 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.539
 of chicken a good portion of protein 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:06.110
 healthy is it worth we go now to clean 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.729

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.900
 serve the rice 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.139
 the arrocito here we already have the rice that 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.020
 practically is ready 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.940
 over here a good portion of rice 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.660
 it is also worth 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.450
 to accompany is steamed rice not what 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.130
 We believed we did not give it flavor taste 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.060
 let's also give with the soy sauce 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.750
 if they want to flavor a little more rice 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.040

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.960

 put here and we will serve our 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:58.610
 penalties for pears because it's something 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.610
 simple simply take them out of the water 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.030
