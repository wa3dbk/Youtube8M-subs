00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
reason I'm like trying to work with the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
reason I'm like trying to work with the
camera<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.609> not<00:00:23.910> really<00:00:24.300> picking<00:00:24.689> up

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
camera and it's not really picking up

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
camera and it's not really picking up
the<00:00:24.990> color<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.640> more<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the color very well it's more of like a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.189 
the color very well it's more of like a
deep<00:00:27.420> burgundy<00:00:27.960> um<00:00:28.849> plum<00:00:29.849> type<00:00:30.390> color<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
deep burgundy um plum type color and I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
deep burgundy um plum type color and I
chose<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.710> color<00:00:31.949> because<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.550> thought<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
chose this color because I thought it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
chose this color because I thought it
would<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.510> perfect<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.980> fall<00:00:35.160> season

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
so I can start with the root process and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.839 
so I can start with the root process and
start<00:06:01.759> dyeing<00:06:02.030> all<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.780> my<00:06:03.050> roots<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.639> here<00:06:04.639> my
