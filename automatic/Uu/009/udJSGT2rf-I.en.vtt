00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.840 

handle<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.650> has<00:01:17.830> already<00:01:18.010> got<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
handle well this has already got the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
handle well this has already got the
bearings<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:23.290> okay<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:24.010> just<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.280> caster

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
bearings it's okay it's just a caster

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.469 
bearings it's okay it's just a caster
and<00:01:26.140> that's<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.619> be<00:01:26.800> my<00:01:27.270> rotation<00:01:28.270> for

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
and that's going to be my rotation for

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:36.670 
and that's going to be my rotation for
the<00:01:28.540> handle<00:01:31.740> these<00:01:33.750> are

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680

to take that out on the part that will

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.839 
to take that out on the part that will
bring<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.390> link<00:02:08.599> right<00:02:08.869> here<00:02:09.849> little

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
bring it up to link right here little

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.150 
bring it up to link right here little
pop<00:02:11.769> top<00:02:12.769> heavy<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:15.560> here's<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.890> bottom

tighten<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.190> down<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:46.220> handle<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:49.040> kind<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
tighten it down the handle is kind of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.020 
tighten it down the handle is kind of
funny<00:02:50.260> show<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.319> know<00:02:52.209> I've<00:02:53.209> put<00:02:53.599> playoff

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
funny show you know I've put playoff

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.569 
funny show you know I've put playoff
pretty<00:02:57.609> this<00:02:58.609> is<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.060> handle<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:01.100> was<00:03:01.340> on

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
pretty this is it to handle that was on

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.550 
pretty this is it to handle that was on
a<00:03:03.790> bungee<00:03:04.790> cord<00:03:05.859> that<00:03:06.859> went<00:03:07.100> through<00:03:07.790> two

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
a bungee cord that went through two

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.599 
a bungee cord that went through two
nylon<00:03:09.560> straps<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:12.019> attached<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.709> big

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
nylon straps and attached to the big

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.500 
nylon straps and attached to the big
rubber<00:03:13.880> band<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.450> working<00:03:14.870> out<00:03:14.959> whatever<00:03:16.510> but

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
rubber band for working out whatever but

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.159 
rubber band for working out whatever but
I<00:03:17.690> saw<00:03:18.049> other<00:03:18.260> purposes<00:03:18.829> int<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:19.280> go<00:03:19.790> figure

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
I saw other purposes int and go figure

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.449 
I saw other purposes int and go figure
it<00:03:21.169> fit<00:03:21.910> quite<00:03:22.910> snug<00:03:23.359> on<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.900> thing<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
it fit quite snug on this thing it

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.770 
it fit quite snug on this thing it
doesn't<00:03:25.880> move<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:26.930> use<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.880> my<00:03:28.880> pan

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
doesn't move so I can use it my pan

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.680 
doesn't move so I can use it my pan
so<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> main<00:03:34.110> ingredient<00:03:34.350> though

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
so this is the main ingredient though

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.800 
so this is the main ingredient though
this<00:03:38.840> whole<00:03:39.840> thing<00:03:40.200> has<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:42.360> this<00:03:42.510> crucial

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
this whole thing has in this crucial

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.920 
this whole thing has in this crucial
part<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.490> i'll<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.910> back<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:45.530> an<00:03:46.530> update
