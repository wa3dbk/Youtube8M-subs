00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hey, youtube, beauty, fernanda. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.740
 of 9 plus a video this time of beautiful 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 son of 49 people who might be 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 the second video of the day in the hundred 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.540
 but this video here is going to be one more 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 video of a tip here is not that I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 I managed to do here in my neighborhood the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.090
 son of 4 beta 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
 As you may have noticed, I do not know. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 if you saw the first video on 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.810
 video is first impressions of the goal 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.910
 I said nelina that already has some 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 game optimization programs and maybe 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 You can not run the game in 60 seconds. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.110
 parts come from good yes the thing of the kind né 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 if you did not see, you 'll leave nobody in the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 Description of the video I give a last 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 general and I found the beta and now here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 I had an idea to try to disable 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.100
 some filters thing like that and me 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 I was finally able to leave the game 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 stable form that's what I say 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.160
 it's kind between 50 and 65 sometimes beating 70 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 fps sakineh 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.149
 sometimes she jucá fps basically for 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.309
 cause of the game is optimized and such 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 was a way that I could do the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'm running pretty well, so I'm going to play. 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 show you if you tighten that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.600
 come here in video options here was the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 that I managed to let so I could 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.490
 leave it the way you are here with 60 50 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.210
 and 60 feet what the model here is in 1920 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.610
 by 1080 is in windhoek obvious that the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 focus of this 91's was the following I leave 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.119
 here graphic area in question 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.820
 I left everything in the middle of what you 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.939
 can see the quality and texture filter 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.150
 Dad, what deactivates has disabled the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.430
 before the slab do not leave it off and I heard it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.860
 environment will also let them off and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 here in the resolutions that I left in 75 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 percent doing it here leaving 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.000
 way you 're here if you want to make a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 video and I got to leave the game is fine 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 I was at 60 fps, I'll try to record 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.450
 here with my cell phone is is a weak 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 connected to him to show you here 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.280
 I'm not feeling anything because I 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.860
 fap is unfortunately not recording and editing 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.659
 the films made up for those who do not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.060
 knows how to speak and also captures the frame rate 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.030
 come in, but this is a video that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.649
 indicates there is already a tank on my side 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.209
 brother and another video dedicated to 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.830
 maybe I 've heard until today just a little bit 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.540
 later that the first video of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.830
 first impressions left so I'll go 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.140
 try to record here started 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.330
 then the guys will be there I'll be back 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.770
 Let's see if it's okay if I do not stay. 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.510
 I see what I do here we have to 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.190
 Not only does it seem that I already 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 I'll be back, guys 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.210
 Good guys, they owe the stranger here. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.150
 my voice at the time I'm recording 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.160
 now in the direct of the cell is as I said 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.260
 does not have a camera with the tripod then 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.950
 It will be very difficult to continue playing here. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.490
 - You see here on top of that 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.740
 79 76 75 kind of show iraq 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.560
 looking at the list 69 70 71 70 cm more 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.540
 front is a thing of those few 5560 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 fps is not leaving like that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 I showed you some numerical and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.620
 just whoever wants to try to run on the ultra 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.150
 and in the Senate and try to testify so 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.400
 those same settings I used 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.870
 just type so use another one using a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.790
 spoke these things so that you have a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.850
 video card more powerful than me 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.130
 which is the same as 6 569 test without 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.450
 problems that you may not have 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.850
 I know if it will work for everyone 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.360
 Because as I said the video of the game is 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.830
 optimized for nothing, right or not I know 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.900
 is happening to everyone because 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.519
 can achieve this goal 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 the game is optimized to also 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.200
 pretty effect on the screen it beating 5650 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.269
 time of the parties in the competition there are 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.830
 call me but I see that the type 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.010
 so at least I was able to leave the game 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.150
 rather let's play in a tank of the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.820
 my side 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.290
 here near the fire also to 50 people 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.540
 they want to know about dying because of the type 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 arriving only with one hand but more 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.070
 There, guys, I wanted to get over here. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.450
 you net goes from house here I 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.680
 I finally got to leave in a way 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.959
 stable 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.100
 the baby's number was 4 not 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.410
 I know if they're going to change this to the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.940
 front or not but for now it gives 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.709
 To play I also recommend that you 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.660
 plays in serving two gringos certain type 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.920
 has 300 pixinguinha songs 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.320
 but you will not face that 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.840
 Arzinho is taking on the game of 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.060
 meet the right Brazilian now leader 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.640
 a fall that was 40 people not to be against 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.769
 but it looks like this but on average 60 50 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.900
 sometimes drops to 40 30-something when you have 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.489
 a lot of action so happens to change 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.989
 I was shooting when I was shooting the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.030
 well-acceptable average so do not 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.110
 is not so 45 pieces with an average 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.840
 very acceptable 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.870
 so this is it people need to like it 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.730
 this video leaving in the comment after 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.610
 Did you really get it? 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.060
 to leave this good that way was here 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.889
 or not 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.090
 but this is a big hug to everyone and 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.090
 See you
