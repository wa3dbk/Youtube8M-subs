 activate more and more forces moved

 additionally complicated the use of the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
 reporter looked for a distant 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.010
 location around the rescuer not the way to 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.010
 stand 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.420
 finally the fear became before 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.340

 person to be found dead 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.100
