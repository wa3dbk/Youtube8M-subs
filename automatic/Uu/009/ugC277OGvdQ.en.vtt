into the skin sometimes when you add a

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.880 
into the skin sometimes when you add a
little<00:01:20.210> too<00:01:20.450> much<00:01:20.600> smoothing<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.440> texture

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
little too much smoothing the texture

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
little too much smoothing the texture
gets<00:01:22.100> taken<00:01:22.340> away<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.330> can<00:01:23.510> go<00:01:23.630> ahead<00:01:23.780> and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
gets taken away so you can go ahead and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.350 
gets taken away so you can go ahead and
reapply<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.280> bit<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.670> texture<00:01:26.090> on

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
reapply a little bit of that texture on

reapply a little bit of that texture on
top<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.080> smoothness<00:01:27.380> if<00:01:27.740> you'd<00:01:27.860> like<00:01:28.010> to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
top of the smoothness if you'd like to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.090 
top of the smoothness if you'd like to
and<00:01:28.610> then<00:01:29.120> last<00:01:29.450> is<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.840> evenness<00:01:30.799> slider

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and then last is the evenness slider

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.640 
and then last is the evenness slider
this<00:01:31.610> helps<00:01:31.970> reduce<00:01:32.360> some<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.110> rudder<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
this helps reduce some of the rudder and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.910 
this helps reduce some of the rudder and
