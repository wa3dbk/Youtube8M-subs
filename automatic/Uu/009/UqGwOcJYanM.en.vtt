00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.640
 I'm very well see you 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.129
 this considered one of the most trades 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.559
 dangerous in the world but currently in 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.090
 glass cleaning in buildings is 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.799
 incorporating new technologies and 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.449
 our country is not here in this change 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.449
 fernando let's say in the details 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.360
 but for that I think it's 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.730
 and here I have the city 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.100
 these images could be by 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.680
 disappear and the cleaning of glasses in 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 height to take a new direction towards 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.790
 use of new technologies 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.890
 technologies that reduce 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.100
 accidentability of this work in a 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.080
 100% and that are also completely 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.210
 friendly to the environment 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.700
 effectively technology that we 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.770
 We are bringing from USA and England 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.220
 they are also number one is what 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.660
 security then that's why I do 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.100
 four years are implementing that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.860
 line we are bringing the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.710
 chilies so far this year have already 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
 there were two fatal accidents 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.220
 related to the work of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.200
 vertical cleaners in height but 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.660
 This machine aims to eliminate 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.240
 situations of risk has two meters 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.670
 wide works with a roller that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 the time it injects purified water without 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 use of detergents and even 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.660
 is able to function in 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.660
 buildings as tall as the waterfront 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.390
 center is a machine that is robotized 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.790
 it is operated under remote control from 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.190
 surface and this machine rises without 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.380
 anyone 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.290
 supporting the work the machine without 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.810
 However, this technology is not exempt 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.450
 of the work of the human being Carlos is 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.400
 professional mountaineer and is 20 years old 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.700
 of experience in the field of 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.729
 vertical cleaning in height at 60 meters 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.440
 his dexterity takes center stage and he 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.000
 mix perfectly with the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.000
 operation of the machine 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.840
 because the machine +17 in certain 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.840
 sectors 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.540
 and the vertical workers 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.519
 but all of the machine the turn 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.760
 Chile is the first country in Latin America 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.189
 in importing this technology the machine 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.090
 It takes 30 minutes to complete a job 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:28.219
 it would take 4 hours the best of everything is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.799
 that do not throw waste into the environment 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.659
 since the water used is destined 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.790
 for the irrigation of terraces or 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.790
 recycled for a new cleaning 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.570
 all right
