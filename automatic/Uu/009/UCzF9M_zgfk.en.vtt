00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello friends continue today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 talk about stat dynamite this method 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.209
 development of oxidative muscle fibers 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.209
 was coined by professor victor 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:18.180
 Nikolayevich force I still in the last century and 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.850
 in our time to question 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.490
 the effectiveness of this method is 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.360
 sign on their own ignorance 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.870
 I'll show you how I'm doing now. 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.380
 exercise for the broadest muscles on 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.070
 horizontal blocks 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:43.020
 stat dynamic mode for development 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:47.300
 oxidative muscle fibers important 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 rule that should be followed when 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 stat dynamic mode is that 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.870
 your muscles should be permanent 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 tension at the time of the approach 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.060
 thoughts should not relax with a signal to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.190
 the fact that your muscles do not relax 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.410
 will serve life unbearable 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.600
 your working muscles to 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.210
 muscles weren't relaxing we limit 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.990
 amplitude of motion and apply 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.630
 elastic bandage which is all 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.630
 time in tension during the approach 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.800
 approach lasts from 30 seconds to a minute 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 approach combined for greater 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.330
 efficiency all over now i will accomplish one 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:49.790
 series for the broadest back muscles on 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:57.740
 the simulator is horizontally limited 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:00.680
 amplitude of muscle movement and constant 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.240
 muscle tension and not relaxing and here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 such movement boxes 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.140
 you achieve intolerable doing 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:56.470
 the first is very much impossible for many 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.940
 achieve life in this exercise which 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.560
 here are the secrets 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.030
 and the secrets of everyone in amplitude and their 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.030
 use of elastic bandages 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.830
 for such people who fail 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.090
 achieve the same recommend amplitude 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.300
 here now to restrict this site 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.200
 right literally a few centimeters in 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:31.120
 final phase 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.770
 do this exercise he even 30 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.770
 seconds and continue the second approach 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:23.830
 achieve you need to seek non-muscular 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.260
 rejection approach you must commit 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.720
 an eruption which allows more 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.720
 do exercise 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:42.010
 rest 30 seconds and now will be the third 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.010
 final approach 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.400
 that's all
