00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.400
 hi friends from youtube I hope you are 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.990
 well this time I'm going to work 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.759
 style sinaloa of which style 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 our highly expert so be 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.140
 patience here I am 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.390
 also showing them how I change 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.960
 I design do not look like I draw a 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.210
 smile because you can cut yourself 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.040
 horrible so you have to mark very 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.930
 well before cutting the acrylic on 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.140
 all of these nails that are from 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.140
 sculptural already marked the smile with 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.320
 the nail cutter and the cut is 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.829
 perfect you know where it's going next 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.010
 I remove all that is that the excess of 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.899
 acrylic I will not get to my girl 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.120
 natural especially if I'm using 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.699
 the load and there I am drawing another 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.180
 Smiles because my almond was very 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.210
 extended so you have to lower the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.720
 but I still removing acrylic until 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.320
 a little bit there as you can see and clean 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.420
 everything from cider tea with alcohol and come 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.590
 that is very little acrylic but still 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.470
 does not exist and I put the first one as it is 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.800
 as usual and we will use type of 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.850
 normal resin and I'm placing the 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.390
 tips 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.970
 we make the cut of the measure that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.900
 we want and we are going to place the acrylic 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.890
 this acrylic is the same as you in 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.100
 the nails stiletto us easy undressed us 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.530
 and this acrylic I did I did not 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.560
 from the beginning that is something that is not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.820
 I invented myself is simply by lifting 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.539
 of enesa and what a cover that is a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.399
 pink color very very short but what 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.640
 I do that is that I add yellow 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.539
 we killed a little what is pink 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 Remember when you do not want so much 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.360
 pink add yellow and you will know what 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.120
 well it remains but very little already after 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.850
 that dry I'm doing the limado 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.090
 normal perfecting it with meat 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.420
 because I'm taxed like that and I do 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.370
 the lunette so very dim then I do the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.530
 polished 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.080
 and polishing is counted when it is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.230
 ready when you feel the nail and feel 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.150
 very finite after to remove all kinds of 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.330
 dust and clean with alcohol and I took another 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.640
 time and everything is very clean nail 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 so there is no residue left when 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.079
 put the happy one will look ugly I'll go 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.440
 use these pebbles that I showed you there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:55.880
 very fast and the chain 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.010
 the glue is the sun is this is what 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.660
 worse because they do not believe that it is very 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 happy for what it is to enjoy no longer 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.130
 it's the best but well I was there 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 struggling to face the truth I 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.860
 it took me like 30 minutes only in the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.690
 decorated with a hand that is horrible 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.390
 I have to improve on this but they are 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.130
 very popular unhas put ribbon or you 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.080
 they are going to cost so expensive because you can 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.390
 buy jewelry in large quantity 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.440
 from placing it on a flame stone 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.110
 big 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.810
 and that little pebble is for you but there the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.900
 we have to cross the we are placing 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.450
 the chain that this chain really 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.270
 It's not my friend because as more pay 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.069
 but rather it is the resin not that is not 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.739
 we hide the chain in the resin is 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.840
 horrible I 'm not that fast so I do not 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.459
 I need a retina not that I know that 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.940
 it's very fast because I'm going to be in 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.610
 problems but here we go we are placing 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.370
 so the stones where we want is that 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.010
 be true this is how they say here 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.750
 Freestyle is what you want 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 place where you want in a way that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.050
 look pretty 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.230
 I already put that good droplet those droplets 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.090
 he gave it to me, he does not bang inc and they're 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
 I hope you already have the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.700
 sale I promise I loved the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.430
 I had to use good that's how 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.860
 they left I'm adding it is the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 ultraviolet by going around the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.540
 decoration but still playing 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.460
 the edges of the stones and touching the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.860
 shore the chain for you to attend and 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.600
 a way that you do not network in the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.060
 hair that is for the reason that I do not 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.130
 they like so much 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.689
 Then with an orange stick 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.360
 I remove the excess 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.089
 and that's it, that's how they ended up but 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.039
 they like it and I send a hug to all 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.719
 thank you for the support that you spend very 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.719
 Good night. See you later
