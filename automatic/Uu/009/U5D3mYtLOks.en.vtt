00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
task so that is that's a bit of a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.690 
task so that is that's a bit of a
challenge<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.219> keep<00:00:41.370> telling<00:00:41.610> them

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
challenge you know keep telling them

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
challenge you know keep telling them
walk<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.450> rough<00:00:42.780> walking<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.380> rugged

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
walk a little rough walking in a rugged

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.389 
walk a little rough walking in a rugged
walk<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> little

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
walk a little

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
walk a little
you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.879> offbeat<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.440> complication

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you know offbeat and the complication

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.990 
you know offbeat and the complication
there<00:00:47.160> could<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.730> could<00:00:47.760> really

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
there could be that they could really

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
there could be that they could really
twist<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> around<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> somewhere

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
twist that around and take it somewhere

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
twist that around and take it somewhere
else<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.610> need<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> edge<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> still

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
else so you just need that edge it still

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
else so you just need that edge it still
needs<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> look<00:00:52.050> fashion<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> same

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
needs to look fashion but at the same

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
needs to look fashion but at the same
time<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.550> needs<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
time it needs to have that little bit of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100 
time it needs to have that little bit of
extra<00:00:55.890> portion

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.370

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
goes up to mellow yellows and we go up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.940 
goes up to mellow yellows and we go up
to<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.549> forest<00:02:18.940> green

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.050 

there's<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.070> lot<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.250> don't<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.700> about<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
there's a lot we don't know about the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.760 
there's a lot we don't know about the
female<00:02:25.300> anatomy<00:02:25.510> because<00:02:25.930> they're<00:02:26.230> not<00:02:26.380> women

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
female anatomy because they're not women

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.800 
female anatomy because they're not women
ourselves<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.420> huge

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
ourselves and that is I think a huge

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.170 
ourselves and that is I think a huge
advantage<00:02:29.350> because<00:02:30.070> you<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
advantage because you can be the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.750 
advantage because you can be the
creative<00:02:31.480> one<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.080> really<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:33.160> know<00:02:33.340> cut<00:02:33.580> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
creative one and really you know cut the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.730 
creative one and really you know cut the
body<00:02:33.940> slash<00:02:34.390> through<00:02:34.870> color<00:02:35.140> do<00:02:35.380> whatever

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
body slash through color do whatever

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.380 
body slash through color do whatever
because<00:02:36.130> it's<00:02:36.460> beyond<00:02:36.940> your<00:02:37.330> understanding

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
because it's beyond your understanding

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.410 
because it's beyond your understanding
so<00:02:38.320> you're<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.770> lot<00:02:39.040> more<00:02:39.100> playful<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:40.210> journey

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
so you're a lot more playful the journey

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.750 
so you're a lot more playful the journey
from<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> moss<00:02:41.290> green<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.980> canary<00:02:42.400> yellows

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
from the moss green to canary yellows

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.750 
from the moss green to canary yellows
and<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> sky<00:02:43.540> blue<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.290> Vermillion<00:02:44.890> red

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
and like a sky blue and a Vermillion red

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400

up<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.530> hope<00:02:50.800> we've<00:02:51.040> been<00:02:51.070> able<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.490> do

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
up of and I hope we've been able to do

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.540 
up of and I hope we've been able to do
that<00:02:52.020> we've<00:02:53.020> seen<00:02:53.320> like<00:02:53.350> God<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.130> using

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
that we've seen like God are using

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.820 
that we've seen like God are using
through<00:02:55.270> his<00:02:55.390> wireframes<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.140> lot<00:02:56.350> he<00:02:56.680> would

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
through his wireframes a lot he would

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.920 
through his wireframes a lot he would
make<00:02:57.010> eyes<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.030> his<00:02:58.180> own<00:02:58.240> sense<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.810> I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
make eyes but in his own sense and I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170 
make eyes but in his own sense and I
could<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.980> got<00:03:00.490> interested<00:03:00.880> towards

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
could have like got interested towards

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.210 
could have like got interested towards
that<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.720> interpreted<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.380> into<00:03:02.770> this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
that and I interpreted that into this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.790 
that and I interpreted that into this
print<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.210> significant<00:03:04.990> focus<00:03:05.470> on

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
print it is not a significant focus on

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.560 
print it is not a significant focus on
his<00:03:06.070> artwork<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:06.580> then<00:03:06.760> something<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:07.420> took

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
his artwork but then something we took

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.830 
his artwork but then something we took
it<00:03:07.690> out<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.050> his<00:03:08.200> artwork<00:03:08.560> here
