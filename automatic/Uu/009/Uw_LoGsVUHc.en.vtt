the spacebar the brush radius option
pops<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.460> I'll<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> similar<00:00:27.090> selection

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pops up I'll make a similar selection

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
pops up I'll make a similar selection
and<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:27.930> you'll<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.160> trimming

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and now you'll see that the trimming

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.120 
and now you'll see that the trimming
occurs<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.300> bit's<00:00:30.420> left<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:31.130> now

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
occurs that a little bit's left over now

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
occurs that a little bit's left over now
I'll<00:00:32.250> lower<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.700> draw<00:00:32.910> size<00:00:33.239> slider<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.930> bring

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I'll lower the draw size slider to bring

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
I'll lower the draw size slider to bring
down<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.469> brush<00:00:34.710> radius<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.219> I'll<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
down my brush radius and I'll make a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
down my brush radius and I'll make a
similar<00:00:35.730> selection<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.200> you'll<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
similar selection and you'll see that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470 
similar selection and you'll see that
there's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.430> groove<00:00:38.700> added<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there's a little groove added to the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619 
there's a little groove added to the
surface<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> amount<00:00:41.670> has<00:00:41.820> turned<00:00:42.090> away<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
surface the amount has turned away is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
surface the amount has turned away is
determined<00:00:43.140> by<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> size<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.800> brush

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
determined by the size of my brush

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
determined by the size of my brush
radius<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:45.000> I'll<00:00:45.149> hold<00:00:45.329> ctrl<00:00:45.840> shift<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
radius now I'll hold ctrl shift in the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
radius now I'll hold ctrl shift in the
spacebar<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.340> turn<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> polygroup

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
option and this option automatically
generates<00:00:51.570> polygroups<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.350> every<00:00:52.649> cut<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
generates polygroups for every cut you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.530 
generates polygroups for every cut you
make<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> clip<00:00:53.640> brushes
