00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:57.600 
this c-45 time straight line what we
call<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.830> life<00:02:46.100> also<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.610> don't<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.090> look

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.039 

outside<00:02:59.260> the<00:03:00.260> key<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.709> fit<00:03:00.920> them<00:03:01.040> upside<00:03:01.400> down

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
outside the key to fit them upside down

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.449 
outside the key to fit them upside down
basically<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.319> chocolates<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.040> still<00:03:04.280> liquid

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
basically so chocolates is still liquid

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.580 
basically so chocolates is still liquid

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
to make a little speed engine that fit

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.840 
to make a little speed engine that fit
for<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.799> pop<00:03:10.069> him<00:03:10.340> then<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.700> can

house<00:03:15.140> they're<00:03:15.440> very<00:03:15.620> thin<00:03:15.890> edge<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.640> when<00:03:16.820> you

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
house they're very thin edge so when you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.940 
house they're very thin edge so when you
try<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.180> cut<00:03:17.510> them<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.959> nothing<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.620> hold<00:03:18.709> out

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
to count how they gonna have a bobble

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.550 
to count how they gonna have a bobble
approach<00:03:25.850> camel<00:03:26.390> come<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.200> something

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
approach camel come out it's something

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.069 
approach camel come out it's something
liquid<00:03:27.950> up<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.730> liquids<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.209> come<00:03:29.480> out<00:03:29.630> that's

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
liquid up the liquids on come out that's

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.210 
liquid up the liquids on come out that's
why<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.290> all<00:03:30.530> might<00:03:30.680> need<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.950> search<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
why you all might need to search it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.569 
why you all might need to search it
writer<00:03:31.900> exactly<00:03:32.900> go<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.950> out<00:03:34.130> they're<00:03:34.459> gonna
