00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.540
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.899
 net such're hope you're 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.360
 all very well today is commented there stores 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.460
 today I expound a news about watts 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.650
 dogs and know that going out 25 and 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.180
 May 27 but what do I do two people 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.009
 they are not enjoying on their consoles 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.169
 and in computer especially in computer 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.210
 today is this news about the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.329
 version there was the literal version of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.159
 I started I started versus console and it's that 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.369
 many people because it creates controversies of 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:32.949
 the comparisons of saying where it will be 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.520
 better or our version and the version 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.140
 low they have much difference then here 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.180
 you have a video nobody in the link that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.930
 give you the description that is viver 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.269
 access pointcom you have a video on the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.309
 which explain the difference between the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.550
 ultra and the tinder lobby is very simple 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.929
 the difference is the lighting 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 really the definition of graphics is 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.059
 very similar we could almost say that it is 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.370
 the same and the only thing 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.809
 differences in lighting the version 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.640
 ultra than over lighting 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.230
 therefore you can have better 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.600
 playability and better visibility 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.600
 it is in the change instead the low version 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.740
 it does not have as much lighting as can be 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.310
 do a little bit of the vision to have 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 it's darker in a certain way then 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.330
 They not appreciated as much details but 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.960
 what has been in definition of 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.320
 image the two can reach 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.930
 almost the same quality 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.060
 after talking about the pc version 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 and the console version with which we 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.860
 we are then there is a pretty option 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.890
 curious uat stoxx and is that I started you can 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 enable console graphics and not 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.740
 I'm kidding is an option that is a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.290
 option in the settings state of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.840
 graphics surely you can 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.390
 change the graphics from pc to version 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 of consoles and then we will have to play 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.150
 with some things 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 well how to say those of by the little party 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.119
 from behind in the sense of low asia 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.590
 manga but that's not hard to do is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.870
 as a kind of mobbing like 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.670
 anything else is not official of the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.190
 game but that allows you to do it and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.720
 take the guys who have done this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 video then opened good as you can 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.010
 activate this mode and the video you have it 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.600
 in the description also for you to see 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.730
 the result of how the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.010
 comparative of console and pc being so
