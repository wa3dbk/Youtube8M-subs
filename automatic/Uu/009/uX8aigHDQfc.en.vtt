00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.330
 hello lego befriends this time it will be 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.689
 red again and fast with us I have 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.029
 for you the lego racers 8653 den 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.630
 ferrari enzo ferrari scale one to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.449
 ten 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.699
 the set is from the year 2005 and 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.230
 contains 1360 parts and ten stickers 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.360
 The age recommendation of lego is 10 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.760
 plus and as you can see it works 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.760
 despite racer imprint more device 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.649
 technology is completely set up 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.309
 Model 47 cm long 23 cm wide and eleven 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.960
 centimeters high a total weight of 12 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.870
 kilo so here you get one 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.609
 neat piece of lego in the hand that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.460
 Of course, the model has one 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.100
 steering the pistons in the engine compartment 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 as usual for the technology models 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.520
 French doors can be opened and 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.240
 Of course, the bonnet at the rear 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.259
 The former was built from 2002 to 2004 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.299
 were built only 399 pieces 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.400
 actually it was a 400 piece 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.229
 built for pope johannes paul 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.500
 ii the second one there later but then 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.400
 auctioned for charity 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.049
 to see here now is the 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.729
 trunk lid located at this 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.439
 model does not open properly 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.899
 probably everything is more of the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.610
 optics the list price for the driver 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.770
 by the way were 662 1000 euro and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.869
 only who is the selected customer 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.090
 and a long-standing relationship too 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.229
 Ferrari had ever had the chance 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.020
 to get one 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.750
 Now we come to the heart 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.469
 the driver's a six-liter v12 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:06.350
 motor with 465 kw 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:08.989
 that's 660 ps at 7800 rpm 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.519
 minute the lego designers joined in 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.660
 the design of the engine room really 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.670
 a lot of effort 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.950
 look at a photo of the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.079
 engine blocks from the original vehicle is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.060
 you can see many details such as the 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.470
 suspension here with silver 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.570
 tubing was recreated 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190
 but now we come to the highlight of 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.140
 sets and the wing doors here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.420
 in between there is a lever 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.319
 if you put this slightly backwards 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.689
 shoves 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.359
 it solves the whole mechanism of 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.700
 Shutters off and the doors will be full 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:40.999
 gently and slowly folded upwards 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.180
 in contrast to the lego racers 8145 den 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:46.879
 599 gtb is the interior here rather 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.769
 Spartan here you can now 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.870
 one of the two dampers recognize the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.629
 responsible for the tower mechanism 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.239
 are there the door down and after 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.819
 it has to close in at the same time 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.040
 better one takes both hands or two 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.530
 finger so you do not break anything 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.950
 but it is very easy to do that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.950
 to open 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.760
 Here I have the model again 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.250
 turned around to see everything again 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.650
 What else is hidden here you can 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.350
 the flasks look very nice like that 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.840
 different also the other cycling 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.720
 and of course the again 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.060
 mechanism of steering something 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.100
 raised and here you can see how the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.050
 Wheels beat in nicely around the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.000
 mechanism of the door opening again something 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.370
 To better illustrate, I show it 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.200
 again from this perspective because upper 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.300
 Damper is curious the lower one is 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.660
 relaxed now we relax the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.490
 Upper damper will open the door will 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.690
 Now the door again with care and 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.840
 love closed 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.330
 the damper stretches again and again 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.280
 The door can be very carefully and again 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.820
 to be opened gently here 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.430
 once again everything opened at the 355 km 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.750
 h fast flitzer of it by the way of 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.880
 0 to 100 in 3.7 seconds can do it 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.250
 set comes with a thick construction manual 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.230
 folder and the bags are numbered 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.960
 there are again in this set 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.060
 rare parts such as the 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.150
 Radzierblenden in five spoke optics 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.260
 then there are red long flexible ones 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.890
 pipes and axles with a length of 7 m 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.750
 and 10 m in red in the construction of the 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.220
 especially the technology 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.560
 fans have their joy 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 First you start with the chassis then 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 if the engine comes then the interior comes 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 And finally, the big ones 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.020
 plates and the flexible rods 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.280
 attached the course of the optics of 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.170
 make out the vehicle 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.810
 Here you can see some photos of the 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.940
 original ferrari enzo mari and here are 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.170
 it's a little lego fari we 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.300
 maybe later in the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.350
 I will thank you 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.150
 Definitely for me 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.310
 attention and I hope you look 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.310
 again purely Briggs of 21
