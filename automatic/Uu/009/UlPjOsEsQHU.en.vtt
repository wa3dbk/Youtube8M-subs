00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.689
 you're going to do this I could send it to 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.909
 oven but if you want to have more 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.669
 taste leave it at least two three 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.689
 four hours in the refrigerator then it's more 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.459

 150 degrees stolen by quiet do not you 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.430
 I say to the minimum minimum but almost 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.200
 about half an hour 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.969
 before that half an hour you take out the paper 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.470
 they make ten four hours of hillside three 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.109
 so that everything tastes a lot after 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.530
 oven under half an hour and then you give 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.000
 you take it out you take out the paper a little trickle 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.320

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.199

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.990
 180 strong oven or at least half 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.280

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.169
 Concentrate well the flavors of milk 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.610

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.120
