00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.170
 so in this video we will learn 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.990
 create 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:21.650
 a pickup object via blueprint pickup 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 the object means that we go through what we 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.940
 we can pick up this object and he 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.320
 somehow affect our 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.140
 the player ie it may be valid in 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.690
 game increase health increase 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 speeds so on with this after that 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.809
 how we picked up this object 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:47.319
 it disappears so let's start the creation 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.569
 blueprint of the blueprint class object 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:55.719
 accordingly choose the type of rector 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.719
 standard pickup pickup pickup 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:09.280
 tailbone click twice send 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:17.170
 static between object in principle we are not 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.170
 it is important that we have a ball 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.780
 accordingly we must go to the field 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.500
 graph and here we are setting up an idea not 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.990
 of our object that is when we have it 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.570
 will pick up we have to create some 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.620
 Effect 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.670
 yes and most importantly we must 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.310
 be sure to still make kalyazin squat 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.940
 that is, how our pickup interacts 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 object with others accordingly here we are 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.890
 choose an ovir foot 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 so we can pass through it 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:07.510
 that means and go to the graph here 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:13.250
 here we create events for our 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.380
 an object when an overlock event that is 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.450
 when he begins to interact with 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.860
 our facilities with other facilities in 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.110
 particular with the player and have him 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.350
 destroy first therefore 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 add event overlock event ector 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.110
 begin overlock and we will add more effect 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:44.030
 explosion when we go through this 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:47.720
 ball explosion effect we add through with 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.880
 full meter from location here we choose 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:59.930
 set which will appear we will make 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:03.140
 explosive and after that we'll have to 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.920
 destroy our agent and the facility 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:13.010
 sector a destructor is also intact 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:17.739
 everything should be accordingly 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.739
 the position of the explosion we have to get 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.150
 locale detector ie get 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.010
 the position of our object after this 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.010
 but test 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.520
 so well, actually you need to put a couple 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:12.829
 balls we clamp to 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:18.049
 volt we copy here as we see happens 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:22.690
 a blast when I approach the ball start with 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.690
 it all works
