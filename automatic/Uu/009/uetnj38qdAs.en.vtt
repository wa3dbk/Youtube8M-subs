just runs right into these particular at
the<00:04:38.820> toe<00:04:38.970> pockets<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.340> it's<00:04:41.340> nice<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.630> have

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
the toe pockets so it's nice to have

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.390 
the toe pockets so it's nice to have
some<00:04:43.260> water<00:04:43.440> resistance<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:43.949> a<00:04:43.979> pair<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.190> five

some water resistance on a pair of five

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.230 
some water resistance on a pair of five
fingers<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.560> then<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.620> takes<00:04:46.740> off<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.250> can't

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
fingers and then it takes off I can't

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.990 
fingers and then it takes off I can't
look<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> inside<00:04:49.729> can't<00:04:50.729> really<00:04:50.910> make

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
look on the inside can't really make

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240 
look on the inside can't really make
water<00:04:51.300> or<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.780> velcro<00:04:52.289> waterproof<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.949> velcro

water or a velcro waterproof that velcro
sweat<00:04:55.039> still<00:04:56.039> feel<00:04:56.220> pretty<00:04:56.460> good<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:56.970> don't

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
sweat still feel pretty good I don't

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.620 
sweat still feel pretty good I don't
think<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.570> notice<00:04:57.840> any<00:04:57.960> water<00:04:58.169> on<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.320> insides

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
think I notice any water on the insides

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.020 
think I notice any water on the insides
nothing<00:05:00.630> about<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.889> three<00:05:02.789> layers

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
nothing about it is the three layers

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.510 
nothing about it is the three layers
fabric<00:05:03.360> we're<00:05:03.660> gonna<00:05:03.810> make<00:05:03.900> these<00:05:04.050> warmer<00:05:04.530> and

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
fabric we're gonna make these warmer and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.310 
fabric we're gonna make these warmer and
the<00:05:06.090> water<00:05:06.330> resistance<00:05:06.510> on<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.930> outside

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
the water resistance on the outside

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.960 
the water resistance on the outside
seems<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:08.070> keep<00:05:08.280> some<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.850> moisture

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
seems to keep some of the moisture

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.070 
seems to keep some of the moisture
inside

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
inside

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.129 
inside
in<00:05:10.740> other<00:05:10.889> words<00:05:11.389> yeah<00:05:12.389> breathability<00:05:12.870> is

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
in other words yeah breathability is

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.950 
in other words yeah breathability is
something<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.690> you're<00:05:15.690> gonna<00:05:15.810> think

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
something that that you're gonna think

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.920 
something that that you're gonna think
about<00:05:16.199> with<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:17.150> pair<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.180> five<00:05:18.600> meters<00:05:18.720> that

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
about with a pair of five meters that

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.860 
about with a pair of five meters that
are<00:05:18.990> large<00:05:19.199> water<00:05:19.590> resistant<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.630> I'm<00:05:21.630> just

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
are large water resistant so I'm just

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.219 
are large water resistant so I'm just
some<00:05:23.180> some<00:05:24.180> things<00:05:24.360> there<00:05:24.539> you<00:05:24.930> can<00:05:25.050> kind<00:05:25.200> of

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
some some things there you can kind of

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.270 
some some things there you can kind of
take<00:05:25.349> a<00:05:25.410> look<00:05:25.560> on<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.740> inside<00:05:25.860> one<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.190> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
take a look on the inside one of the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.680 
take a look on the inside one of the
things<00:05:26.400> they<00:05:26.520> did<00:05:26.669> with<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:26.849> these<00:05:27.120> launchers

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
things they did with you these launchers

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.480 
things they did with you these launchers
is<00:05:27.930> you'll<00:05:28.349> see<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.620> seam<00:05:28.889> that<00:05:28.919> runs<00:05:29.190> down

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
is you'll see the seam that runs down

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.460 
is you'll see the seam that runs down
the<00:05:29.550> down<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> middle<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:31.050> kind<00:05:31.229> of<00:05:31.260> comes

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
the down the middle and it kind of comes

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.710 
the down the middle and it kind of comes
together<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.950> heel<00:05:32.360> goes<00:05:33.360> all<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.539> way<00:05:33.630> to

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
together the heel goes all the way to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.500 
together the heel goes all the way to
the<00:05:33.840> front<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.700> let<00:05:35.700> me<00:05:35.789> see<00:05:36.090> if<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.330> can<00:05:36.479> zoom

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
the front and let me see if I can zoom

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.980 
the front and let me see if I can zoom
and<00:05:37.160> I'm<00:05:38.160> going<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.550> show<00:05:38.700> you<00:05:38.729> this<00:05:39.000> take<00:05:39.960> a

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
and I'm going to show you this take a

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.770 
and I'm going to show you this take a
look<00:05:40.229> there<00:05:40.410> so<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.639> very<00:05:41.880> new<00:05:42.090> for<00:05:42.120> five

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
look there so this is very new for five

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.990 
look there so this is very new for five
fingers<00:05:43.050> usually<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.800> seams<00:05:44.550> are<00:05:44.729> on<00:05:44.820> the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
fingers usually the the seams are on the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.210 
fingers usually the the seams are on the
periphery<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.660> each<00:05:45.780> toe<00:05:46.020> pocket<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.710> this

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
periphery of each toe pocket in this

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.779 
periphery of each toe pocket in this
case<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.729> seams<00:05:47.970> actually<00:05:49.669> come<00:05:50.669> together

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
case the seams actually come together

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.460 
case the seams actually come together
right<00:05:51.150> underneath<00:05:51.630> in<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.960> middle<00:05:52.229> of<00:05:52.320> each

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
right underneath in the middle of each

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.070 
right underneath in the middle of each
toe<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.639> that's<00:05:54.150> neat<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:54.510> mean<00:05:54.750> it's<00:05:54.900> kind<00:05:55.050> of

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
toe so that's neat I mean it's kind of

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.469 
toe so that's neat I mean it's kind of
that<00:05:55.200> I'm<00:05:55.380> sure<00:05:55.410> it's<00:05:55.830> there<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.520> improve<00:05:57.419> the

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
that I'm sure it's there to improve the

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.200 
that I'm sure it's there to improve the
water<00:05:57.979> resistance<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.099> reduce<00:05:59.460> areas<00:06:00.030> where

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
water resistance and reduce areas where

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.270 
water resistance and reduce areas where
water<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.660> get<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.860> that's<00:06:01.919> kind<00:06:02.160> of<00:06:02.220> a

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
water can get in and that's kind of a

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.870 
water can get in and that's kind of a
neat<00:06:02.460> feature<00:06:04.220> so<00:06:05.220> anyways<00:06:05.430> that's<00:06:05.610> the

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
neat feature so anyways that's the

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.850 
neat feature so anyways that's the
launcher<00:06:06.240> in<00:06:06.300> a<00:06:06.360> nutshell<00:06:06.539> it<00:06:07.349> seems<00:06:07.620> like<00:06:07.770> an

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
launcher in a nutshell it seems like an

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.680 
launcher in a nutshell it seems like an
interesting<00:06:08.010> entry<00:06:08.760> into<00:06:09.030> this<00:06:09.120> into<00:06:09.539> the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
interesting entry into this into the
