 and video games are usually a 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.900
 concern for parents and mothers is 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.910
 normal that we want to wait when we see 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.640
 who devote all their free time to this 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.150
 activity forgetting to do their 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 school assignments and their obligations but 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.450
 we can not blame it on everyone 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.129
 we wait for the videogames besides 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.540
 to be entertaining are tools 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.489
 wonderful to develop 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.860
 control skills the taking of 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.629
 Friday decisions this is true 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.150
 that children react in real life 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.489
 in everyday situations increases your 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.910
 self-esteem and also their reflexes with 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 motor skills but like all 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.119
 tools depend on the use that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.160
 let's make them the video games too 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.899
 have their disadvantages like that the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.290
 children begin to lose social contact 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.500
 or suffer from physical deficiencies such as 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 vision problems 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.050
 or the carpal tunnel that's why it's good 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.460
 that you start to control the time in 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.760
 that your children remain in front of a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.200
 video game that yes the reaction of them 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.150
 very surely it will not be positive 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.650
 when you try to set limits for that 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 Here are some recommendations so that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.479

 they will understand that it is not a decision 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.070
 arbitrary and if not because someone else is 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.899
 strict with the new rules that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.700
