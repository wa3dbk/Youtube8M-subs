kind<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.140> stuff<00:04:53.640> alright<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:54.910> as<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.210> was

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
kind of stuff alright so as I was

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.930 
kind of stuff alright so as I was
finishing<00:04:55.750> up<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.140> project<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:57.010> realized

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
finishing up this project I realized

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.670 
finishing up this project I realized
that<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.420> know<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.750> was<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> little<00:04:59.050> sloppy<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
that you know it was a little sloppy the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.250 
that you know it was a little sloppy the
strings<00:04:59.980> up<00:05:00.130> here<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.490> little<00:05:00.760> slack<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:02.080> got

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
strings up here a little slack and I got

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.740 
strings up here a little slack and I got
to<00:05:02.410> thinking<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:03.160> seem<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.030> remember<00:05:04.180> tying

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
to thinking I seem to remember tying

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.600 
to thinking I seem to remember tying
them<00:05:04.930> down<00:05:05.110> at<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.380> end<00:05:05.440> on<00:05:05.770> my<00:05:05.890> old<00:05:06.040> bike<00:05:06.310> I

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
them down at this end on my old bike I

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.310 
them down at this end on my old bike I
checked<00:05:07.180> my<00:05:07.330> instructions<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.050> sure<00:05:08.290> enough

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
checked my instructions and sure enough

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.140 
checked my instructions and sure enough
they<00:05:08.710> do<00:05:08.770> recommend<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.520> anchor<00:05:09.970> them

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
they do recommend that you anchor them

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.980 
they do recommend that you anchor them
near<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.990> rear<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.530> seat<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.510> tie

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
near the rear of the seat so you can tie

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.930 
near the rear of the seat so you can tie
a<00:05:14.020> knot<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.530> both<00:05:14.740> strings<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:15.820> can

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
a knot in both strings so that you can

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.640 
a knot in both strings so that you can
pull<00:05:16.120> them<00:05:16.240> evenly<00:05:16.570> if<00:05:16.750> you'd<00:05:16.870> like<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.560> know

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
pull them evenly if you'd like you know

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.720 
pull them evenly if you'd like you know
if<00:05:17.740> you're<00:05:17.860> having<00:05:17.980> difficulty<00:05:18.550> with<00:05:18.700> that

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
if you're having difficulty with that

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.940 
if you're having difficulty with that
tying<00:05:19.630> out<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:19.990> then<00:05:20.080> pull<00:05:20.320> them<00:05:20.440> both<00:05:20.680> down

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
tying out and then pull them both down

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.800 
tying out and then pull them both down
so<00:05:21.310> they're<00:05:21.430> equally<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.360> know<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.600> same

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
so they're equally you know the same

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.810 
so they're equally you know the same
amount<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:23.050> tension<00:05:23.260> on<00:05:23.530> each<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:24.040> somehow

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
amount of tension on each and somehow

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.730 
amount of tension on each and somehow
secure<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.630> post<00:05:25.960> or<00:05:26.260> something<00:05:26.470> at<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
secure to a post or something at the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.250 
secure to a post or something at the
opposite<00:05:27.400> end<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.670> the<00:05:27.730> seat<00:05:27.970> okay<00:05:28.690> opposite

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
opposite end of the seat okay opposite

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.010 
opposite end of the seat okay opposite
to<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.440> strap<00:05:29.740> end<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.480> I<00:05:31.480> don't<00:05:31.600> think<00:05:31.900> it's

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
to the strap end and I don't think it's

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.630 
to the strap end and I don't think it's
too<00:05:32.140> detrimental<00:05:32.860> or<00:05:32.980> anything<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.550> know

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
too detrimental or anything you know

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.490 
too detrimental or anything you know
probably<00:05:33.910> been<00:05:34.210> fine<00:05:34.510> if<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.750> had<00:05:34.870> lifted<00:05:35.260> here

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
probably been fine if I had lifted here

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.010 
probably been fine if I had lifted here
but<00:05:36.190> they<00:05:36.280> do<00:05:36.340> recommend<00:05:36.820> it<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.720> know<00:05:37.840> might

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
but they do recommend it you know might

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.630 
but they do recommend it you know might
just<00:05:38.200> stop<00:05:38.380> you<00:05:38.500> from<00:05:38.590> getting<00:05:38.770> wrinkles<00:05:39.400> or
