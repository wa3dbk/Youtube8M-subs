 network card is increased and this is 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.699
 for if you want to take a picture 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.409

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.759
 they have so I can not investigate 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.409
 a lot but I 'm not going to fire but 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.000
 they also ask you for the reality card 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 I think you increased from 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.690
 some items or something unlockable 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.759

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.240
 let's give it then this we take to 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.240
 give logic 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.670
 and here we can choose the song I go 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.090
 to choose this one that talks about war is mine 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.980

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.460
 of angle will be able to see 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.319
 it also moves as if it were a 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.209
 concert 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.280
 as if we were recording friend 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.709
 We can also take photos written with 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.230
 orbit that is the very father equal for 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.840
 to be able to show off what happened in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.969
 mind she can walk freely 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.879
 well it 's planted we can move the 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.710
 camera where we want and I put myself 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.720
 each shelf there so they can see 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.520
 now so you can see the performance of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.000
 which is other pictures of reality 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.660
 increased 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.030
 let's turn it around 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.910
 we can go below but when we 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.250
 Come down gives us our notice 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 here that says you are a perverted camps 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.630
 stop looking that from looking down 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.100
 much laughter 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.100
 we stand up again 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.410
 then here we have to see 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.410
 nothing I do not have a video edition 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.300
 for augmented alert card 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.200
 then so you can see these 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.540
 details that left us for the vita 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.540
 because as I explained in the unboxing that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.599
 He had played the PSP for months ago 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.000
 I had a psp and I already missed playing this 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.730
 type of games this update and more 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.330
 technique you do not invite also what would you say 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 imax 3 I think but then I interlomas 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.250
 avoid games in digital 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.720
 but because today I've been playing a little 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.720
 to squeeze what is this game 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.930
 so so you can see 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.510
 and they realize the detail is also 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.280
 that lets you clean the screen so that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.220
 You can do it without any option or 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.720
 nothing only exception that I can 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.420
 the logo that is astronomical 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.190
 I am not another you can download it follow it 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.150
 you can do an aerial shape if you lose 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.150
 I received phantom camera 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.970
 so they can see 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.130
 and if they had any doubt about buying 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.580
 this game now is not very very father 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.530
 the truth is that I'm going to upload to the review 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.150
 even if it's in Japanese I do not care 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.150
 I will be the review for you to see 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.990
 this was the presentation of the increase 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.630
 augmented reality 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.620
 I am concluded these victims remember 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.880
 enter the page that I followed fixture that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.460
 I'll be putting it on the screen 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.960
 so that they can visit it in our 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.850
 facebook page if they want this 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.760
 they want to bring me with a lot 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.460
 the taste can bring from Japan 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.490

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.420
