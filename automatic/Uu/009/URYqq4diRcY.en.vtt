00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
affected more than 12% of the population
this<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.209> before<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:16.050> had<00:02:16.640> Alzheimer's<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.849> so

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
this is before we had Alzheimer's and so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.449 
this is before we had Alzheimer's and so
many<00:02:18.690> neurological<00:02:19.530> disorders<00:02:20.069> which<00:02:20.280> are

many neurological disorders which are

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.610 
many neurological disorders which are
growing<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.060> control<00:02:21.150> are<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.319> related

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
growing out of control are they related

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.699 
growing out of control are they related

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
suspicion and dr. Mendelsohn said you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.520 
suspicion and dr. Mendelsohn said you
will<00:02:29.099> see<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.640> next<00:02:29.879> 30<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.239> 40<00:02:30.330> years<00:02:30.989> then

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
will see in the next 30 or 40 years then

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.259 
will see in the next 30 or 40 years then
we're<00:02:31.709> gonna<00:02:31.799> have<00:02:32.010> more<00:02:32.310> problems<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.030> more

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
we're gonna have more problems and more

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.780 
we're gonna have more problems and more
problems<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:34.440> interesting<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.489> third

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
problems it's interesting that the third

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.119 
problems it's interesting that the third
leading<00:02:36.209> cause<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.690> death<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> country

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
leading cause of death in this country

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.580 
leading cause of death in this country
is<00:02:38.540> pharmaceuticals<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.780> I've<00:02:40.140> made<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
is pharmaceuticals and I've made the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.470 
is pharmaceuticals and I've made the
prediction<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.970> less<00:02:42.269> than<00:02:42.629> five<00:02:43.379> years

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
prediction that in less than five years

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.610 
prediction that in less than five years
pharmaceutical<00:02:45.480> treatment<00:02:45.959> will<00:02:46.079> become<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
pharmaceutical treatment will become the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.229 
pharmaceutical treatment will become the
number<00:02:46.950> one<00:02:47.160> leading<00:02:47.519> cause<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.760> death<00:02:48.120> in

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
number one leading cause of death in

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.880 
number one leading cause of death in
this<00:02:48.299> country<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.440> doesn't<00:02:49.739> make<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
this country so it doesn't make a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.610 
this country so it doesn't make a
difference<00:02:49.980> how<00:02:50.970> many<00:02:51.180> wonderful<00:02:51.720> things<00:02:52.140> we

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
difference how many wonderful things we

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.490 
difference how many wonderful things we
learn<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:53.519> we<00:02:53.760> can't<00:02:54.030> find<00:02:54.239> ways<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.599> lower<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
learn if we can't find ways to lower the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.259 
learn if we can't find ways to lower the
use<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.920> pharmaceuticals<00:02:56.099> among<00:02:57.060> our

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
use of pharmaceuticals among our

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.030 
use of pharmaceuticals among our
patients<00:02:57.840> we're<00:02:58.560> gonna<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:58.860> serious

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
patients we're gonna have serious

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.059 
patients we're gonna have serious
problems<00:02:59.629> what<00:03:00.629> did<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.930> learn<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:01.200> dr.

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
problems what did we learn from dr.

years ago and he gave a wonderful
lecture<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:09.440> problems<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.650> vaccines<00:03:11.129> we

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
lecture on problems with vaccines we

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.339 
lecture on problems with vaccines we
learned<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.420> no<00:03:12.540> longer<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:13.079> quiet

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
learned that we can no longer be quiet

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.780 
learned that we can no longer be quiet
and<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:13.860> what<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.129> were<00:03:14.250> doing<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.670> our

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
can count cases of appendicitis I can

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.680 
can count cases of appendicitis I can
count<00:03:52.829> heart<00:03:53.099> disease<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.609> can<00:03:53.760> count<00:03:53.970> cancer<00:03:54.419> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
count heart disease I can count cancer I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.819 
count heart disease I can count cancer I
can<00:03:55.200> count<00:03:55.760> children<00:03:56.760> with<00:03:57.540> leukemia<00:03:57.829> why

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
can count children with leukemia why

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.120 
can count children with leukemia why
can't<00:03:59.130> they<00:03:59.250> find<00:03:59.280> any<00:03:59.760> with<00:03:59.970> autism<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:01.319> I

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
can't they find any with autism and I

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.360 
can't they find any with autism and I
really<00:04:02.940> think<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.359> is<00:04:03.389> due<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.919> the<00:04:04.919> learnings

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
really think it is due to the learnings

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.150 
really think it is due to the learnings
of<00:04:05.609> dr.<00:04:06.510> Mendelsohn<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.139> then<00:04:07.349> dr.<00:04:07.709> Horowitz

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
of dr. Mendelsohn and then dr. Horowitz

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.370 
of dr. Mendelsohn and then dr. Horowitz
who<00:04:08.669> gave<00:04:09.030> us<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.630> freedom<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
who gave us the freedom and the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.300 
who gave us the freedom and the
