ring now this is my River to sear over
right<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.660> walking<00:00:22.170> bait<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
right here my my walking bait that I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679 
right here my my walking bait that I
designed<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.519> River<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> sea<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> we

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
designed for for River to sea and we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.710 
designed for for River to sea and we
actually<00:00:24.930> put<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:26.150> split<00:00:27.150> ring<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> front

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
actually put a split ring on the front

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually put a split ring on the front
so<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> don't<00:00:28.050> need<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> lip<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so you don't need a lip not for this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
so you don't need a lip not for this
particular<00:00:29.099> bait<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.670> zero<00:00:30.060> spooks<00:00:30.449> pop<00:00:30.840> ours

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
particular bait but zero spooks pop ours

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630

things<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
things like that that do not have a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
split ring a loop knot is a great a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
split ring a loop knot is a great a
great<00:00:36.809> knot<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> loop

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
great knot at a time and what the loop

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.910 
great knot at a time and what the loop
nut<00:00:38.370> does<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.879> creates<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.739> real

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
nut does is it creates it's not real

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
nut does is it creates it's not real
tight<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.579> bait<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> creates<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> loop

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
tight on the bait so it creates a loop

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
tight on the bait so it creates a loop
and<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> allows<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.530> bait<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.100> move<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> little

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and it allows that bait to move a little

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
and it allows that bait to move a little
bit<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.149> freely<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.140> topwater

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
bit more freely so with your topwater

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.690 
bit more freely so with your topwater
lures<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> gives<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.579> more

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
lures it gives it a little bit more

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
lures it gives it a little bit more
action<00:00:48.210> makes<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.230> more

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
action makes it a little bit more

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
action makes it a little bit more
realistic<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.760> catch<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.059> fish

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
realistic and you just catch more fish

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
realistic and you just catch more fish
so<00:00:51.690> let<00:00:52.260> me<00:00:52.379> show<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> tie<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> loop

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so let me show you how to tie a loop

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.799 
so let me show you how to tie a loop
knot<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.239> we'll<00:00:54.360> show<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> real

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
knot and then we'll show you a real

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.110 
knot and then we'll show you a real

gonna take my tag end and go through the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
gonna take my tag end and go through the
loop<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.920> created<00:01:44.280> okay<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> use

loop that I created okay you have to use

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.600 
loop that I created okay you have to use
your<00:01:46.380> teeth<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.369> holy

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
okay so now I take this end here and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.389 
okay so now I take this end here and
I'll<00:02:03.210> loop<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.630> around<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.320> main<00:02:04.860> body<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
I'll loop it around the main body of the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.330 
I'll loop it around the main body of the
line<00:02:06.049> about<00:02:07.049> five<00:02:07.380> times<00:02:07.710> three<00:02:08.700> four<00:02:10.009> five

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
line about five times three four five

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790 
line about five times three four five
okay<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.510> now

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
done as you can see here through that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
done as you can see here through that
loop<00:03:14.770> right<00:03:15.040> there

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
loop right there

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.370 
loop right there
creates<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.510> loop<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.100> move<00:03:18.280> around

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
creates a loop and that can move around

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.800 
creates a loop and that can move around
very<00:03:20.380> nice<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:23.410> nice<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.910> does<00:03:25.180> again<00:03:25.660> at

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
very nice very nice that does again at

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.740 
very nice very nice that does again at
that<00:03:25.989> loop<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:26.950> we've<00:03:27.100> created<00:03:27.600> gives<00:03:28.600> a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
that loop that we've created gives a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.720 
that loop that we've created gives a
little<00:03:28.989> bit<00:03:29.140> extra<00:03:29.500> travel<00:03:29.800> your<00:03:30.220> topwater

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
little bit extra travel your topwater

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.729 
little bit extra travel your topwater
lure<00:03:30.940> gives<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.480> little<00:03:31.690> bit<00:03:31.900> extra<00:03:32.019> action

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
lure gives it a little bit extra action

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.310 
lure gives it a little bit extra action
so<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> standard<00:03:34.660> loop<00:03:34.840> knot<00:03:35.050> and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
so that is a standard loop knot and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.790 
so that is a standard loop knot and
again<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> only<00:03:35.890> tie<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.900> when<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.260> or

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
again I only tie it when I have to or

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.890 
again I only tie it when I have to or
when<00:03:39.220> my<00:03:39.340> bait<00:03:39.610> does<00:03:39.910> not<00:03:40.090> have<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.330> split<00:03:40.690> ring

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
when my bait does not have a split ring

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.550 
when my bait does not have a split ring
on<00:03:41.200> it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
on it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.170

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
a lot of times on top order lures so

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.960 
a lot of times on top order lures so
anyways<00:03:43.690> give<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> shot<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.850> a
