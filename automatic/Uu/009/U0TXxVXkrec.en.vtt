compost pile you know there's just those
nine-day<00:00:29.739> differences<00:00:30.429> that<00:00:30.970> compost<00:00:31.899> makes

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
nine-day differences that compost makes

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.470 
nine-day differences that compost makes
in<00:00:32.500> your<00:00:32.619> garden<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.970> great<00:00:34.239> way<00:00:34.450> to

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
in your garden and it's a great way to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.240 
in your garden and it's a great way to
actually<00:00:35.200> give<00:00:35.380> back<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.800> your<00:00:35.890> garden

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
actually give back to your garden

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.549 
actually give back to your garden
whether<00:00:37.090> it's<00:00:37.329> through<00:00:37.690> just<00:00:37.960> piling<00:00:38.230> your

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
whether it's through just piling your

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.439 
whether it's through just piling your
garden<00:00:38.949> scraps<00:00:39.250> letting<00:00:39.609> them<00:00:39.730> break<00:00:39.940> down<00:00:40.180> or

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
garden scraps letting them break down or

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.099 
garden scraps letting them break down or
by<00:00:40.960> taking<00:00:41.440> lawn<00:00:41.829> clippings<00:00:42.399> or<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.809> leaves

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
by taking lawn clippings or just leaves

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.810 
by taking lawn clippings or just leaves
that<00:00:44.289> you<00:00:44.379> rake<00:00:44.590> off<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.039> throwing<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.489> pile

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
that you rake off and throwing a pile

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.939 
that you rake off and throwing a pile
you<00:00:46.359> can<00:00:46.390> give<00:00:46.690> back<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:47.140> your<00:00:47.230> garden<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.800> I

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
you can give back to your garden and I

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.919 
you can give back to your garden and I
think<00:00:48.190> that's<00:00:48.339> really<00:00:48.699> key<00:00:49.000> because<00:00:49.030> without

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
think that's really key because without

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.750 
think that's really key because without
giving<00:00:50.469> nutrients<00:00:50.980> back<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.429> ground

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
giving nutrients back to the ground

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.729 
giving nutrients back to the ground
there's<00:00:52.359> no<00:00:52.449> way<00:00:52.750> for<00:00:52.780> your<00:00:53.079> plants<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.589> grow

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
there's no way for your plants to grow

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.439 
there's no way for your plants to grow
bigger<00:00:54.039> for<00:00:54.399> you<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.910> produce<00:00:55.089> more<00:00:55.390> food

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
bigger for you and to produce more food

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.079 
bigger for you and to produce more food
for<00:00:55.870> you<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.530> I'm<00:00:56.829> not<00:00:56.980> saying<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.429> you<00:00:57.999> know

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
for you and I'm not saying that you know

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.669 
for you and I'm not saying that you know
you<00:00:58.149> need<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.539> turn<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.109> all<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.320> time<00:00:59.530> it

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
you need to turn it all the time it

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.790 
you need to turn it all the time it
needs<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.980> make<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> big<00:01:00.399> habit<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:02.170> keeping

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
needs to make a big habit of of keeping

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.950 
needs to make a big habit of of keeping
up<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.579> kid<00:01:03.909> it's<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.540> can<00:01:04.750> make

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
up on it it's not a kid it's it can make

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.050 
up on it it's not a kid it's it can make
itself<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.890> natural<00:01:06.280> ecosystem<00:01:06.970> in

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
itself it's a natural ecosystem in

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.140 
itself it's a natural ecosystem in
itself<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.690> I<00:01:08.650> chose<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.490> lazy<00:01:09.700> method<00:01:10.090> of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
itself and I chose the lazy method of

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.360 
itself and I chose the lazy method of
doing<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.540> cool<00:01:10.810> composting<00:01:11.500> pile<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:12.010> found

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
doing a cool composting pile I found

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.910 
doing a cool composting pile I found
it's<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.670> lot<00:01:12.910> better<00:01:13.210> than<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> hot<00:01:14.260> composting

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
it's a lot better than a hot composting

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.850 
it's a lot better than a hot composting
pile<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.330> don't<00:01:16.510> get<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.690> whole<00:01:16.900> lot<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:17.170> heat

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
pile you don't get a whole lot of heat

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.490 
pile you don't get a whole lot of heat
from<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:18.340> but<00:01:19.330> if<00:01:19.480> you<00:01:19.690> turn<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.050> every<00:01:20.140> once<00:01:20.380> in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
from it but if you turn it every once in

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.010 
from it but if you turn it every once in
a<00:01:20.620> while<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:21.550> can<00:01:21.730> definitely<00:01:22.240> still<00:01:22.540> get<00:01:22.810> a

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
a while you can definitely still get a

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.070 
a while you can definitely still get a
pretty<00:01:23.380> warm<00:01:23.860> core<00:01:24.340> inside<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:25.270> still

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
pretty warm core inside of it and still

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.560 
pretty warm core inside of it and still
keep<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.500> relatively<00:01:27.190> cool<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.390> other

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
keep it relatively cool so that other

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.020 
keep it relatively cool so that other
micro<00:01:28.960> organisms<00:01:29.770> can<00:01:30.010> move<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.640> kind<00:01:30.970> of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
micro organisms can move in and kind of

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.550 
micro organisms can move in and kind of
inhabit<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.540> compost<00:01:31.960> pile<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.200> I'll<00:01:32.410> show

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

yeah people say you're gonna get a lot
of<00:01:49.450> seeds<00:01:49.720> but<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.500> provides<00:01:50.800> moisture<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
of seeds but it provides moisture it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.020 
of seeds but it provides moisture it
rots<00:01:52.240> down<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.840> breaks<00:01:53.080> down<00:01:53.200> naturally<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
rots down it breaks down naturally and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.810 
rots down it breaks down naturally and
when<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.570> springtime<00:01:55.840> comes<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.650> can<00:01:57.370> simply

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
when the springtime comes I can simply

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
when the springtime comes I can simply
just<00:01:57.940> pull<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.270> seedlings<00:01:58.630> when<00:01:58.720> they

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
just pull up the seedlings when they

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.070 
just pull up the seedlings when they
sprout<00:01:59.190> now<00:02:00.190> if<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.400> look<00:02:00.580> right<00:02:00.730> here<00:02:01.080> this

sprout now if you look right here this

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.410 
sprout now if you look right here this
is<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> compost<00:02:02.710> pile<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.190> I've<00:02:03.340> been<00:02:03.670> kind

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
is the compost pile that I've been kind

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.120 
is the compost pile that I've been kind
of<00:02:04.480> brewing<00:02:05.020> for<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> little<00:02:05.560> while<00:02:05.740> there's

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
of brewing for a little while there's

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.940 
of brewing for a little while there's
bigger<00:02:06.760> stuff<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.330> God<00:02:07.600> tomato<00:02:08.110> stalks<00:02:08.530> that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
bigger stuff like God tomato stalks that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
bigger stuff like God tomato stalks that
won't<00:02:09.250> break<00:02:09.459> down<00:02:09.519> for<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.300> while<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:11.230> if<00:02:11.379> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
won't break down for a while but if you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.640 
won't break down for a while but if you
look<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.830> here

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
look in here

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.869 
look in here
you'll<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.549> lot<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:14.439> black<00:02:15.439> and<00:02:15.799> brown

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
you'll see a lot of black and brown

you'll see a lot of black and brown
houmous<00:02:16.909> this<00:02:17.659> stuff<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.189> recently

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
houmous this stuff I just recently

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.000 
houmous this stuff I just recently
turned<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.140> gonna<00:02:21.260> take<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> while<00:02:21.799> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
turned so it's gonna take a while to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.759 
turned so it's gonna take a while to
break<00:02:22.129> down<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.689> not<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.930> really

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
break down it's not a it's not a really

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.050 
break down it's not a it's not a really
quick<00:02:25.069> process<00:02:25.340> but<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:27.590> um<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.579> a<00:02:28.730> slower

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
quick process but it's um it's a slower

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.990 
quick process but it's um it's a slower
process<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:30.500> actually<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:31.220> really<00:02:31.280> healthy

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
process that actually is really healthy

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.780 
process that actually is really healthy
because<00:02:32.439> if<00:02:33.439> you<00:02:33.650> look<00:02:33.859> at<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.189> soil<00:02:34.519> right

going on in this soil so as you guys can

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.229 
going on in this soil so as you guys can
see<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:45.260> rich<00:02:45.920> houmous<00:02:46.940> there

some like non biodegradable scraps they

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.550 
some like non biodegradable scraps they
got<00:02:52.879> thrown<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.239> here<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.599> mean<00:02:54.139> I<00:02:54.230> cannot

got thrown in here I mean I cannot

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.190 
got thrown in here I mean I cannot
identify<00:02:54.799> what<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.670> stuff<00:02:55.909> is<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.569> warm<00:02:56.989> to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.979 
identify what this stuff is it's warm to
the<00:02:57.230> touch<00:02:57.549> but<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:58.670> has<00:02:58.849> like<00:02:59.090> centipedes<00:02:59.750> and

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
the touch but it has like centipedes and

you<00:03:04.549> know<00:03:04.579> all<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:05.180> those<00:03:05.389> those<00:03:06.079> things<00:03:06.470> that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
you know all of those those things that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.360 
you know all of those those things that
that<00:03:08.480> come<00:03:08.750> along<00:03:09.019> with<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.439> high<00:03:09.650> compost<00:03:10.129> pile

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
that come along with a high compost pile

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.069 
that come along with a high compost pile
plus<00:03:11.030> some<00:03:11.269> things<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.629> don't<00:03:11.720> really<00:03:11.870> like

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
plus some things that don't really like

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.449 
plus some things that don't really like
it<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.230> warm<00:03:12.620> such<00:03:12.980> as<00:03:13.189> you<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.269> ants<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
it that warm such as you know ants and

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.030 
it that warm such as you know ants and
different<00:03:16.459> types<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:16.959> bacteria<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.199> yeah<00:03:18.980> you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
different types of bacteria and yeah you

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.490 
different types of bacteria and yeah you
don't<00:03:19.280> get<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.549> michael<00:03:19.940> raisa<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.959> that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
don't get the michael raisa that that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.990 
don't get the michael raisa that that
like<00:03:21.709> white<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.940> white<00:03:24.699> bacterial<00:03:25.699> growth

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
like white that white bacterial growth

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.390 
like white that white bacterial growth
but<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.159> I<00:03:28.370> think<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.940> way<00:03:29.180> more<00:03:29.209> um

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
but you know I think it's way more um

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.770 
but you know I think it's way more um
it's<00:03:31.400> way<00:03:31.579> more<00:03:31.790> natural<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.419> way<00:03:32.599> because

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
it's way more natural this way because

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.640 
it's way more natural this way because
it's<00:03:33.049> cool<00:03:33.409> and<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.780> nature<00:03:36.139> you<00:03:36.500> don't

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
it's cool and and in nature you don't

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.920 
it's cool and and in nature you don't
have<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.829> big<00:03:37.069> pile<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.730> heats<00:03:38.000> up<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> flame

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
have a big pile that heats up to a flame

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.759 
have a big pile that heats up to a flame
you<00:03:39.169> know<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.349> mean<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:39.829> not<00:03:40.040> it's<00:03:40.909> not

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
you know I mean it's not it's not

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.420 
you know I mean it's not it's not
natural<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.799> be<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:43.549> hot<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.569> think<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
natural to be so hot so I think that the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.569 
natural to be so hot so I think that the
natural<00:03:46.909> way<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.479> way<00:03:47.810> better<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.949> both

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
natural way is is way better but both

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.670 
natural way is is way better but both
methods<00:03:50.090> work<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.510> will<00:03:50.569> say<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.139> just<00:03:51.169> have

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
methods work I will say I just have

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.020 
methods work I will say I just have
tried<00:03:51.919> both<00:03:52.069> methods<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.699> can<00:03:53.629> tell<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.019> that

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
tried both methods and can tell you that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.960 
tried both methods and can tell you that
you<00:03:56.030> know<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.180> really<00:03:56.510> can't<00:03:56.989> beat<00:03:57.579> this<00:03:58.579> type

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
you know you really can't beat this type

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.930 
you know you really can't beat this type
of<00:03:59.000> soil<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.449> mean<00:03:59.569> it's<00:03:59.750> just<00:04:00.019> rich<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.940> loose

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
of soil I mean it's just rich and loose

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.920 
of soil I mean it's just rich and loose
and<00:04:03.489> see<00:04:04.489> there's<00:04:05.409> centipedes<00:04:06.409> and<00:04:06.949> it's<00:04:07.400> just

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and see there's centipedes and it's just

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.770 
and see there's centipedes and it's just
rich<00:04:08.930> with<00:04:09.169> flora<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.889> fauna<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:12.729> I<00:04:13.780> just

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
rich with flora and fauna so I I just
