00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
exactly like Dropbox if you install it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
exactly like Dropbox if you install it
onto<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.119> computer<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> put

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

things<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> folder<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.409> syncs<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
things in the folder and it syncs up the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
things in the folder and it syncs up the
folder<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.060> names<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.810> sync<00:01:19.080> folder<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
folder and it names my sync folder you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
folder and it names my sync folder you
can<00:01:19.710> name<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> wherever<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
can name it wherever you want and the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
can name it wherever you want and the
cool<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.330> exactly

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
cool thing about that is it is exactly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.630 
cool thing about that is it is exactly
like<00:01:24.900> Dropbox<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> gives<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> eight<00:01:26.460> gigs

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
like Dropbox but it gives you eight gigs

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.530 
like Dropbox but it gives you eight gigs
for<00:01:26.729> free<00:01:27.829> only<00:01:28.829> downside<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
for free only downside of that is that I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
for free only downside of that is that I
can't<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:33.140> sink<00:01:34.140> an<00:01:34.320> entire<00:01:34.619> folder<00:01:34.890> on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
can't actually sink an entire folder on

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.380 
can't actually sink an entire folder on
my<00:01:35.460> prime<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> folder<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.710> my

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
my prime so if I have a folder like my

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.090

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
to actually give a little check mark of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.910 
to actually give a little check mark of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
what I want to sync up and it will sync

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.259 
what I want to sync up and it will sync
it<00:02:33.040> up<00:02:33.130> except<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.940> had<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.239> it

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
it up except I had to do it

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.699 
it up except I had to do it
automatically<00:02:34.840> that's<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> only<00:02:35.350> real

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
automatically that's the only real

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.500 
automatically that's the only real
downside<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.700> thought<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.269> could

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
downside of it I thought I could

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.580 
downside of it I thought I could
actually<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:39.340> able<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:40.230> sync<00:02:41.230> an<00:02:41.349> entire

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually be able to sync an entire

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.250 
actually be able to sync an entire
folder<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.630> can't<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.750> that's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
folder but can't do that and that's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.289 
folder but can't do that and that's
pretty<00:02:47.470> much<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:48.370> web<00:02:48.580> storage<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.150> pretty

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
pretty much my web storage it's pretty

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.900 
pretty much my web storage it's pretty
cool<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.519> said<00:02:51.580> eight<00:02:51.880> gigs<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.799> plenty

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
cool like I said eight gigs is plenty

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.640 
cool like I said eight gigs is plenty
I'm<00:02:54.910> not<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.810> storing<00:02:56.349> a<00:02:56.410> lot<00:02:56.440> of

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
I'm not going to be storing a lot of

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.559 
I'm not going to be storing a lot of
data<00:02:56.799> on<00:02:56.920> there<00:02:57.160> Oh<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.730> cool<00:02:58.180> side<00:02:58.390> about

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
data on there Oh in the cool side about

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.120 
data on there Oh in the cool side about
that<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.959> they<00:02:59.260> don't<00:02:59.440> they<00:02:59.769> don't<00:02:59.799> give

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that is they don't they don't give

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.410 
that is they don't they don't give
limits<00:03:00.640> on<00:03:01.769> folders<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.980> mean<00:03:03.250> files<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.390> you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
limits on folders I mean files so you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.520 
limits on folders I mean files so you
can<00:03:04.660> actually<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:06.180> huge<00:03:07.180> four<00:03:07.810> gig<00:03:08.079> file

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
can actually have a huge four gig file

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.500 
can actually have a huge four gig file
on<00:03:08.859> there<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.730> suits<00:03:09.940> doesn't<00:03:10.239> put<00:03:10.359> any

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
on there and the suits doesn't put any

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.870 
on there and the suits doesn't put any
limit<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.930> which<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.859> pretty<00:03:11.920> cool<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.430> think

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
limit on it which is pretty cool I think

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.610 
limit on it which is pretty cool I think
dropbox<00:03:13.359> it<00:03:13.540> gives<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.260> gives<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.560> a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
dropbox it gives you it gives you a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.349 
dropbox it gives you it gives you a
limit<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:15.190> not<00:03:15.310> sure<00:03:15.459> what<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.670> limit<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.000> but

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
limit I'm not sure what the limit is but

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.630 
limit I'm not sure what the limit is but
it<00:03:16.630> does<00:03:17.140> give<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.470> limit<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:17.799> each<00:03:18.040> file

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
it does give you a limit for each file

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.780 
it does give you a limit for each file
but<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.500> web<00:03:20.680> storage<00:03:20.950> actually<00:03:21.459> doesn't

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
but this is web storage actually doesn't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.559 
but this is web storage actually doesn't
give<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.569> limit<00:03:23.549> just<00:03:24.549> go<00:03:24.639> back<00:03:24.819> in<00:03:25.000> here

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
give you a limit just go back in here

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.009 
give you a limit just go back in here
and<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:26.469> that's<00:03:26.680> some<00:03:27.150> basics<00:03:28.150> web<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.540> web

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
and then that's some basics web so web

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
and then that's some basics web so web
storage<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.620> here's<00:03:30.189> the<00:03:30.430> other<00:03:31.150> cool<00:03:31.389> thing

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420

but the sounds actually come through the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.689 
but the sounds actually come through the
device<00:04:04.780> through<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.680> prime<00:04:08.489> which<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.549> pretty

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
device through the prime which is pretty

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.959 
device through the prime which is pretty
cool<00:04:09.939> I<00:04:10.180> mean<00:04:10.810> it's<00:04:11.139> normal<00:04:11.739> it's<00:04:12.669> pretty

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.420 

and<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:16.380> sounds<00:05:16.770> still<00:05:16.950> coming<00:05:17.220> from<00:05:17.310> my

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
and that sounds still coming from my

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:25.010 
and that sounds still coming from my
computer<00:05:17.790> not<00:05:18.150> from<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.540> Prime<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.900> only

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
computer not from the Prime but the only

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.650 
computer not from the Prime but the only
thing<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.410> yeah<00:05:25.830> when<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.250> do<00:05:26.730> run<00:05:27.630> a

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
thing is that yeah when you do run a

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.990 
thing is that yeah when you do run a
program<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:29.250> does<00:05:29.700> stop<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.430> can<00:05:32.610> go<00:05:32.790> back<00:05:32.970> to

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
program it does stop so I can go back to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.930 
program it does stop so I can go back to
splash<00:05:33.360> top<00:05:34.640> but<00:05:35.640> basically<00:05:36.540> when<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.940> stop

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
splash top but basically when you stop

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.490 
splash top but basically when you stop
it<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.420> does<00:05:39.630> actually<00:05:39.900> stop<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:41.340> disconnects

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
it it does actually stop it disconnects

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.100 
it it does actually stop it disconnects
in<00:05:43.500> other<00:05:43.680> words<00:05:43.890> when<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.220> launch<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.610> program

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
in other words when you launch a program

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.470 
in other words when you launch a program
so<00:05:46.110> that's<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.500> little<00:05:46.760> so<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:48.030> do<00:05:48.150> little

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
so that's a little so I can do little

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.440 
so that's a little so I can do little
things<00:05:48.570> like<00:05:49.050> this<00:05:49.970> let's<00:05:50.970> test<00:05:51.180> this<00:05:51.300> out

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
things like this let's test this out

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.520 
things like this let's test this out
right<00:05:51.630> now<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.810> don't<00:05:51.930> want<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.200> go<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.350> my
