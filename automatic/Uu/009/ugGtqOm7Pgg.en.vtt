00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.680

 Cruising are host families of FC Groningen 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 since last summer in gouda water 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.969

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.469
 I did there together with mic mic duzink 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.390
 a project and then certain people came and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 the order of yes we are actually searching 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.329
 who want to go stay together and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 cats with rio hear about that sometimes 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.170
 goes with my wife of god yes it is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.110
 it's fun to be involved with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.930
 such a youth education and woman youth 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 pull anyway really and then there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 the urge came from 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 blue late so try let me level 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.780
 make a start with well contact and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 then we can still screens of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.030
 yes we will not do or will do 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.970
 or the run-up must be very bad 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 be careful and well we just 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.189
 to attempt 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 after a few conversations was a click 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.220
 between the family cruising on the one hand and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.979
 tim and jesse on the other hand was the feeling 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 from both sides we are good again and they 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 to be parts of the family 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 so this is your cottage was also one of them 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 the first one done together 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.659
 did we go by the pet is it 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.189
 whole house and this is from now on 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 yours too 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.150
 so everything is here in the house is also 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 for you so deal with it properly 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.689
 to deal with 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.490
 and then those arrive fine through that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740
 is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.729
 my feeling for our feeling is there 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.380
 went very well 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.600
 how do you like it here at home one 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.409
 freestone and it works very well 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.490
 I 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.830
 we heard them first 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.750
 in the intake interview 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.759
 stadium when he immediately thought of it 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.479
 this this seems a very very warm to me 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.820
 family 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.950
 and well I've got myself here from moment 1 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.750
 I felt at home here and well it is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.770
 very important because when you become you 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.209
 yet your familiar environment goes 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.440
 taken away and also for you 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.180
 performance 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.660
 They are already important to you right away 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 feel at home and I've been all year 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.200
 my name is an animal 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.910
 You are immediately part of the family 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.100
 say in i want to do what you want 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.019
 she wants to help you with everything when you do 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.400
 somewhere it is a series you 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.530
 for example, we have math or 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.269
 I know what a help very questions 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.730
 always to your grades and how are you 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.160
 and how did the training go in the yes that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 I like Jan and Ria Crew more 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.940
 They also don't regret it 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.739
 have become a host family of FC Groningen 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.489
 that requires giving from both sides 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.650
 and take 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.420
 it's not so well they do the door 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.440
 disappear open to their room and there 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.900
 is it on 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.730
 no they are part of your family and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 you have to want that and that gives 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.739
 load my other side you get one 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.000
 I also very much you get a very much 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.820
 for back 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 very much naja spontaneity they are 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.820
 we come to siri every time 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.370
 we feel they are happy that 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.100
 they now again that they are here 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.220
 I can still remember last year 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.630
 last fall was a pretty heavy storm and 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.510
 is not quite here in the street 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.880
 and the state was deposed but everywhere 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.500
 branches were blown off the trees and then 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.430
 they came home and are they then 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.430
 that is not in our house 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.359
 our philosophy is the final part 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.130
 be part of your family 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.859
 be clear in what you want and what you do 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.060
 accepting what you do not accept and 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.060
 I get a lot in return
