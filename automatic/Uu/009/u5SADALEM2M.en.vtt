00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
SPF 55 this also is probably my favorite

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
SPF 55 this also is probably my favorite
sunscreen<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> face<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> hasn't

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
sunscreen for the face because it hasn't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.679 
sunscreen for the face because it hasn't
broken<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.219> year<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
broken me out all year and I have really

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.499 
broken me out all year and I have really
dry<00:02:00.840> skin<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.500> haven't<00:02:01.860> had<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.509> excess

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
dry skin and I haven't had like excess

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
dry skin and I haven't had like excess
oil<00:02:03.750> created<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.619> skin<00:02:04.829> hasn't<00:02:05.159> gotten

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
oil created and my skin hasn't gotten

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
oil created and my skin hasn't gotten
any<00:02:05.670> drier<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.600> using<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.140> think

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
any drier because of using it so I think

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.740 
any drier because of using it so I think
it's<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.590> good<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.520> skin<00:02:09.300> types<00:02:09.330> but

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it's really good for all skin types but

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.040 
it's really good for all skin types but
I<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> works<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.739> dry

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
I know it works a little for dry

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.050 
I know it works a little for dry
and<00:02:11.200> there's<00:02:11.530> no<00:02:11.590> really<00:02:11.920> timeframe<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.760> go

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
much money on a spray tan and there's

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.010
