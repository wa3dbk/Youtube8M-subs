taofledermaus today we're going to show
you<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.820> difference<00:00:03.149> between<00:00:03.449> hard<00:00:03.810> body

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
you the difference between hard body

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
armor and soft body armor

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.540 
armor and soft body armor
we'll<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:08.910> blasting<00:00:09.510> both<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.960> these<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
we'll be blasting both of these with a

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.209 
we'll be blasting both of these with a
68<00:00:11.550> caliber<00:00:12.049> 18<00:00:13.049> gram<00:00:13.320> hardened<00:00:13.980> steel

industrial ball bearing these balls
travel<00:00:17.850> over<00:00:18.420> 1,200<00:00:19.020> feet<00:00:19.199> per<00:00:19.260> second<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
travel over 1,200 feet per second and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:35.349 
travel over 1,200 feet per second and
absolutely<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.689> deform<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.800> lead

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.359 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.689 

in<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.350> first<00:00:36.649> shot<00:00:36.920> you'll<00:00:37.280> notice<00:00:37.579> that

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
in this first shot you'll notice that

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.910 
in this first shot you'll notice that
the<00:00:37.850> plate<00:00:38.089> is<00:00:38.300> set<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.809> slight<00:00:39.230> angle<00:00:39.409> that

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
the plate is set at a slight angle that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.790 
the plate is set at a slight angle that
is<00:00:40.100> just<00:00:41.000> as<00:00:41.179> a<00:00:41.210> safety<00:00:41.480> precaution<00:00:41.800> to

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
is just as a safety precaution to

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.310 
is just as a safety precaution to
prevent<00:00:42.979> the<00:00:43.339> ball<00:00:43.579> from<00:00:43.609> bouncing<00:00:44.510> straight

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
prevent the ball from bouncing straight

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.899 
prevent the ball from bouncing straight
back<00:00:45.589> at<00:00:45.829> us<00:00:45.949> which<00:00:46.129> would<00:00:46.309> not<00:00:46.519> be<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.699> good

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
back at us which would not be a good

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.389 
back at us which would not be a good
thing<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:47.899> always<00:00:48.019> set<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.859> plates<00:00:49.129> that

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
thing so we always set the plates that

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.079 
thing so we always set the plates that
we<00:00:49.519> shoot<00:00:49.760> at<00:00:49.909> an<00:00:50.210> angle<00:00:50.539> like<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:52.000> here<00:00:53.000> we

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
we shoot at an angle like that here we

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:05.169 
we shoot at an angle like that here we
go<00:00:53.269> okay<00:00:56.500> okay<00:01:02.799> in<00:01:03.799> this<00:01:04.280> shot<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:04.610> wanted<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
go okay okay in this shot we wanted to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.359 
go okay okay in this shot we wanted to
see<00:01:05.390> what<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.869> plate<00:01:06.110> would<00:01:06.289> do<00:01:06.470> at<00:01:06.740> an<00:01:07.130> even

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
see what the plate would do at an even

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.510 
see what the plate would do at an even
sharper<00:01:08.090> angle<00:01:08.539> from<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.869> shooter<00:01:09.520> for

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
sharper angle from the shooter for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.550 
sharper angle from the shooter for
whatever<00:01:10.700> reason<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.569> ball<00:01:11.899> bearing<00:01:12.259> stayed

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
whatever reason the ball bearing stayed

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.279 
whatever reason the ball bearing stayed
inside<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.250> shot<00:01:13.520> cup<00:01:13.819> and<00:01:14.259> traveled<00:01:15.259> with

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
inside the shot cup and traveled with

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.499 
inside the shot cup and traveled with
the<00:01:15.530> wadding<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.100> everything<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.670> it

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
the wadding and everything and it

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.719 
the wadding and everything and it
deflected<00:01:18.020> off<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.380> plate<00:01:18.619> at<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:19.310> pretty<00:01:19.640> high

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
deflected off the plate at a pretty high

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.820 
deflected off the plate at a pretty high
velocity<00:01:20.569> still<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:23.929> see<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.289> damage<00:01:24.560> to

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
velocity still here we see the damage to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.340 
velocity still here we see the damage to
the<00:01:24.950> plate<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.429> hardened<00:01:25.850> steel<00:01:25.909> ball<00:01:26.479> left

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the plate the hardened steel ball left

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.260 
the plate the hardened steel ball left
some<00:01:27.560> pretty<00:01:27.740> good<00:01:27.950> dents<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.819> hardened

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
some pretty good dents in this hardened

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.380 
some pretty good dents in this hardened
steel<00:01:29.479> plate<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.700> think<00:01:31.940> it's<00:01:32.060> safe<00:01:32.209> to<00:01:32.360> say

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
steel plate but I think it's safe to say

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.999 
steel plate but I think it's safe to say
if<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:32.780> were<00:01:32.899> wearing<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.350> plate<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.799> shot

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
if you were wearing this plate and shot

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.219 
if you were wearing this plate and shot
with<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.159> ball<00:01:34.429> bearing<00:01:34.610> from<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.970> shotgun<00:01:35.229> you'd

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
with a ball bearing from a shotgun you'd

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.550 
with a ball bearing from a shotgun you'd
still<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.530> alive

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
still be alive

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.559 
still be alive
now<00:01:39.560> we'll<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.099> how<00:01:40.310> soft<00:01:40.879> body<00:01:41.209> armor

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
now we'll see how soft body armor

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.529 
now we'll see how soft body armor
performs<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:43.009> is<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> ten<00:01:43.729> millimeter<00:01:43.970> thick

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
performs this is a ten millimeter thick

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.160 
performs this is a ten millimeter thick
piece<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.530> layered<00:01:45.890> Kevlar<00:01:46.550> now<00:01:47.539> originally

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
piece of layered Kevlar now originally

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.960 
piece of layered Kevlar now originally
it<00:01:48.319> had<00:01:48.349> a<00:01:49.569> ceramic<00:01:50.569> outer<00:01:50.840> coating<00:01:51.319> on<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.970> we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
it had a ceramic outer coating on it we

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.240 
it had a ceramic outer coating on it we
decided<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.569> save<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.989> piece<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.590> we

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
decided to save this piece and we

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.160 
decided to save this piece and we
thought<00:01:55.429> it'd<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.700> good<00:01:56.000> representation<00:01:56.539> of

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
thought it'd be a good representation of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.060 
thought it'd be a good representation of
soft<00:01:58.099> body<00:01:58.399> armor

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.570 

Wow<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.540> dented<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> crap<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 

you<00:02:11.910> definitely<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.540> difference<00:02:13.080> here

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you definitely see the difference here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.760 
you definitely see the difference here
between<00:02:13.640> soft<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.820> hard<00:02:14.910> body<00:02:15.720> armor<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
between soft and hard body armor the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.400 
between soft and hard body armor the
hard<00:02:17.070> body<00:02:17.370> armor<00:02:18.020> kind<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.110> acts<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.320> a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hard body armor kind of acts like a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.620 
hard body armor kind of acts like a
shield<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.070> deflects<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> round<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.360> soft

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
shield and deflects the round the soft

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
shield and deflects the round the soft
body<00:02:21.870> armor<00:02:22.260> works<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> catcher's<00:02:23.520> mitt

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
body armor works like a catcher's mitt

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.620 
body armor works like a catcher's mitt
and<00:02:23.970> captures<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.900> round<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:26.760> capturing<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and captures the round but capturing the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.710 
and captures the round but capturing the
round<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.920> stop<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> bullet

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
round and just stop in that bullet

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.540 
round and just stop in that bullet
doesn't<00:02:30.720> prevent<00:02:31.020> trauma<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
doesn't prevent trauma like that and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.470 
doesn't prevent trauma like that and
that<00:02:32.940> hole<00:02:33.180> goes<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.660> there<00:02:33.810> several<00:02:34.260> inches

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
that hole goes in there several inches

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.510 
that hole goes in there several inches
so<00:02:36.480> even<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.170> Kevlar<00:02:37.560> was<00:02:37.800> much<00:02:38.160> thicker

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
so even if the Kevlar was much thicker

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580 
so even if the Kevlar was much thicker
than<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> imagine<00:02:39.630> how<00:02:39.780> much<00:02:40.020> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
than that you can imagine how much of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.100 
than that you can imagine how much of
the<00:02:40.980> energy<00:02:41.100> would<00:02:41.520> still<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:42.209> transmitted<00:02:42.989> in

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the energy would still be transmitted in

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.170 
the energy would still be transmitted in
that<00:02:43.260> small<00:02:43.650> area<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:44.370> your<00:02:44.520> body<00:02:44.850> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that small area into your body and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.290 
that small area into your body and
caused<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> lot<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.410> internal<00:02:46.950> damages<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.670> think

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
caused a lot of internal damages I think

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000 
caused a lot of internal damages I think
it<00:02:48.480> would<00:02:48.570> be<00:02:48.690> safe<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.080> say<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.860> you're

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
it would be safe to say that if you're

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.220 
it would be safe to say that if you're
wearing<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.430> there'd<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.230> greater

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
wearing this there'd be a greater

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.120 
wearing this there'd be a greater
likelihood<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.190> dying<00:02:54.709> we've<00:02:55.709> had<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> lot

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
likelihood of you dying we've had a lot

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.890 
likelihood of you dying we've had a lot
of<00:02:56.160> people<00:02:56.340> suggest<00:02:57.030> shooting<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> ball

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900

bearings<00:02:58.320> at<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.709> AR<00:02:59.070> 500<00:02:59.310> plate<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.720> were

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
bearings at the AR 500 plate and we were

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.449 
bearings at the AR 500 plate and we were
happy<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.160> want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.400> again

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
happy to do that and we want to again

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.290 
happy to do that and we want to again
