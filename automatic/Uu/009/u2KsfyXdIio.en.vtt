down here actually glow-in-the-dark
you've<00:03:13.709> also<00:03:13.859> got<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.730> spider<00:03:15.209> attack

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
you've also got the spider attack

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.199 
you've also got the spider attack
feature<00:03:16.260> right<00:03:16.620> there<00:03:16.829> which<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
feature right there which is just a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.860 
feature right there which is just a
flick<00:03:19.109> action<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.239> shoots<00:03:21.510> out<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
flick action and it shoots out the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.259 
flick action and it shoots out the
spider<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.760> also<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:26.160> falling<00:03:27.060> down

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
spider you also have the falling down

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.530 
spider you also have the falling down
tree<00:03:27.750> function<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:29.280> all<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.549> do<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.000> pull<00:03:30.359> this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
tree function so all you do is pull this

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.030 
tree function so all you do is pull this
out<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.209> tree<00:03:33.420> falls<00:03:33.720> down

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
out right here and the tree falls down

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.009 
out right here and the tree falls down
and<00:03:35.040> then<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.670> tree<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:35.909> have<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.659> the

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
and then up in the tree you have the the

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.260 
and then up in the tree you have the the
spider<00:03:37.319> cocoon

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
spider cocoon

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.740 
spider cocoon
which<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.990> does<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:42.320> clip-on<00:03:43.320> over

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
which all it does is just clip-on over

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.030 
which all it does is just clip-on over
one<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.930> branches<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> there's<00:03:46.800> just

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
one of the branches and there's just

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.280 
one of the branches and there's just
holes<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.420> stick<00:03:48.660> your<00:03:48.780> minifigure

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
holes in it so you stick your minifigure

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.480 
holes in it so you stick your minifigure
in<00:03:49.500> there<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:52.730> then<00:03:53.730> just<00:03:54.980> put<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.010> over<00:03:56.250> one

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
in there and then just put it over one

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.360 
in there and then just put it over one
of<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.670> branches<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:58.070> now<00:03:59.070> we'll<00:03:59.190> take<00:03:59.310> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
of the branches and now we'll take a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.620 
of the branches and now we'll take a
look<00:03:59.430> at<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.000> minifigures

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
