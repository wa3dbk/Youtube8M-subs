main<00:00:12.750> difference<00:00:12.960> between<00:00:13.290> these<00:00:13.559> two

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
main difference between these two

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.000 
main difference between these two
products<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.570> they<00:00:15.570> basically<00:00:15.809> work<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
products is they basically work to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.700 
products is they basically work to
increase<00:00:17.369> testosterone<00:00:17.820> by<00:00:18.630> way<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.140> two

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
increase testosterone by way of two

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.640 
increase testosterone by way of two
completely<00:00:20.550> different<00:00:20.850> mechanisms<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
completely different mechanisms the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
completely different mechanisms the

supplies your body with steroidal
saponins<00:00:27.920> mainly<00:00:28.920> from<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.340> ingredient

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
saponins mainly from an ingredient

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.370 
saponins mainly from an ingredient
called<00:00:29.789> test<00:00:30.240> FN<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:31.170> another

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
called test FN and from another

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
called test FN and from another
ingredient<00:00:31.890> called<00:00:32.040> tribulus<00:00:32.640> these

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ingredient called tribulus these

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840 
ingredient called tribulus these
steroidal<00:00:33.750> saponins<00:00:34.280> have<00:00:35.280> an<00:00:35.370> effect<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
steroidal saponins have an effect in the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
steroidal saponins have an effect in the
body<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.360> stimulate<00:00:36.870> luteinizing<00:00:37.500> hormone

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
body they stimulate luteinizing hormone

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610 
body they stimulate luteinizing hormone
release<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.329> causes<00:00:39.629> an<00:00:40.020> increase<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
release and this causes an increase in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.410 
release and this causes an increase in
natural<00:00:40.829> testosterone<00:00:41.790> production

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
natural testosterone production

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389 
natural testosterone production
so<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:42.930> test<00:00:43.230> freak<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.219> these

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so with test freak it's really these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
so with test freak it's really these
herbal<00:00:45.210> steroidal<00:00:45.840> saponins<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:47.190> are

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
herbal steroidal saponins that are

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
herbal steroidal saponins that are
causing<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.210> spike<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> natural<00:00:49.020> testosterone

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
causing a spike in natural testosterone

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.549 
causing a spike in natural testosterone
release<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.940> anabolic<00:00:51.420> freak<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
release with the anabolic freak it's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
release with the anabolic freak it's
really<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.039> ingredient<00:00:53.489> called<00:00:53.640> D<00:00:53.910> aspartic

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
really an ingredient called D aspartic

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.020 
really an ingredient called D aspartic
acid<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> d-aspartic<00:00:55.890> acid<00:00:56.030> increases

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
acid and d-aspartic acid increases

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
acid and d-aspartic acid increases
testosterone<00:00:57.480> by<00:00:58.140> accumulating<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
testosterone by accumulating in the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.119 
testosterone by accumulating in the
pituitary<00:00:59.640> gland<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> testes<00:01:01.379> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pituitary gland and in the testes so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740 
pituitary gland and in the testes so
it's<00:01:02.460> completely<00:01:03.180> different<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it's completely different from the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's completely different from the
herbal<00:01:04.170> component<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.830> found<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.220> test

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
herbal component that's found in test

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
herbal component that's found in test
tree<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.600> works<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:07.140> completely

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
tree and it works at completely

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.179 
tree and it works at completely
different<00:01:07.619> ways

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
different ways

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
different ways
so<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.909> d-aspartic<00:01:09.150> acid<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:10.020> anabolic

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so as the d-aspartic acid from anabolic

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
so as the d-aspartic acid from anabolic
freak<00:01:10.860> accumulates<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> pituitary<00:01:12.330> gland

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
freak accumulates in the pituitary gland

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.100 
freak accumulates in the pituitary gland
that<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.920> turn<00:01:14.159> causes<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.939> spike<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> natural

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that in turn causes a spike in natural

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
that in turn causes a spike in natural
testosterone<00:01:16.409> secretion<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.720> take

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
testosterone secretion so if you take

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.770 
testosterone secretion so if you take
these<00:01:19.080> two<00:01:19.140> products<00:01:19.860> together<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:21.630> they're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
these two products together then they're

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
these two products together then they're
going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.200> amplified<00:01:22.830> effect<00:01:23.189> on

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
going to have an amplified effect on

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.440 
going to have an amplified effect on
spiking<00:01:24.030> natural<00:01:24.540> testosterone<00:01:25.290> secretion

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
spiking natural testosterone secretion

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.969 
spiking natural testosterone secretion
the<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> use

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the one way that people like to use

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
the one way that people like to use
these<00:01:29.369> products<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> take

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
these products is they do like to take

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
these products is they do like to take
them<00:01:31.350> together<00:01:31.560> stack<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.549> together<00:01:32.700> take

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
them together stack them together take

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.380 
them together stack them together take
them<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> same<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> 30<00:01:35.040> day<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.909> 60

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
them at the same time so a 30 day the 60

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
them at the same time so a 30 day the 60
day<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.869> period<00:01:36.930> where<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.710> them

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
day time period where they take them

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
day time period where they take them
both<00:01:38.100> together<00:01:38.600> some<00:01:39.600> people<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> cycle

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
both together some people like to cycle

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
both together some people like to cycle
them<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.640> test<00:01:42.420> free<00:01:42.689> take

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
them so they like to do test free take

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
them so they like to do test free take
that<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> four-week<00:01:43.770> cycle<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.670> then

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that for a four-week cycle and then

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
that for a four-week cycle and then
follow<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.439> take<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.189> time<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
follow that up take an off time with the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700 
follow that up take an off time with the
test<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.630> switch<00:01:48.810> over<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> anabolic

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
test or you can switch over to anabolic

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
test or you can switch over to anabolic
freak<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> four-week<00:01:50.610> cycle<00:01:51.079> that's

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
freak for a four-week cycle that's

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
freak for a four-week cycle that's
another<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> could<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.630> or<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
another way you could take them or you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.510 
another way you could take them or you
can<00:01:54.990> simply<00:01:55.380> take<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.740> both<00:01:55.950> together<00:01:56.159> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
can simply take them both together like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
can simply take them both together like
I<00:01:56.640> said<00:01:56.850> stack<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.540> both<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.869> same<00:01:57.960> time

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
I said stack them both at the same time

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
I said stack them both at the same time
and<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.009> most

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and get the most

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
and get the most
testosterone<00:02:00.450> most<00:02:01.020> natural<00:02:01.469> testosterone

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
testosterone most natural testosterone

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.689 
testosterone most natural testosterone
production<00:02:02.270> all<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.479> once
