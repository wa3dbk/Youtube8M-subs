getting resources with this kind of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.219 
getting resources with this kind of
top-down<00:01:03.870> view<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> terrain<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.360> random<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
top-down view the terrain is random and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.730 
top-down view the terrain is random and
pretty<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.070> infinite<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
pretty much infinite but it's going to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
pretty much infinite but it's going to
be<00:01:10.830> shrunk<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.310> since<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> arena<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
be shrunk down since the arena if the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.420 
be shrunk down since the arena if the
arena<00:01:13.439> were<00:01:13.590> too<00:01:13.710> big<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> could<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.250> like

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
arena were too big you could just like

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
arena were too big you could just like
keep<00:01:14.729> walking<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.240> win<00:01:15.659> automatically<00:01:16.200> as

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
keep walking and win automatically as

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.090 
keep walking and win automatically as
the<00:01:16.470> other<00:01:16.799> tributes<00:01:17.369> kill<00:01:17.549> each<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:19.100> right

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this fancy cursor which will actually

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.550 
this fancy cursor which will actually
make<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.880> click<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.119> stuff<00:01:27.560> later

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
make it so you can click on stuff later

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.480 
make it so you can click on stuff later
you<00:01:29.549> move<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> AES<00:01:31.020> WD<00:01:31.470> keys<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.070> the
