00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a casted very nicely it's all one cast

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.299 
a casted very nicely it's all one cast
oops<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:38.149> there's<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.329> one

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
oops there's not there's not just one

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.799 
oops there's not there's not just one
you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.430> small<00:00:41.820> cast<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> cap<00:00:42.660> they

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you know small cast and then a cap they

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.940 
you know small cast and then a cap they
have<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.110> together<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:43.739> one

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
have to put together that's actually one

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.760 
have to put together that's actually one
cap<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.320> plugs<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.559> use

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
cap with these little plugs that you use

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
cap with these little plugs that you use
to<00:00:46.950> fill<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.480> piece

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to fill it to make it all all one piece

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270 
to fill it to make it all all one piece
which<00:00:48.960> means<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
which means that this is actually a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.810 
which means that this is actually a
fully<00:00:50.670> casted<00:00:51.270> cube<00:00:51.809> yeah<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.399> quality<00:00:53.640> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
fully casted cube yeah so the quality of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
fully casted cube yeah so the quality of
the<00:00:53.879> plastic<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.360> very<00:00:54.570> well<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> responds<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the plastic is very well it responds to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
the plastic is very well it responds to
lube<00:00:56.070> very<00:00:56.640> well<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.719> internals<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.609> kind<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
lube very well the internals are kind of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
lube very well the internals are kind of
shaped<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.090> bit<00:01:00.239> definitely<00:01:00.870> think

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
shaped a little bit definitely think

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.689 
shaped a little bit definitely think
what<00:01:01.350> you'd<00:01:01.469> normally<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> cube<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
what you'd normally see in a cube so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.719 
what you'd normally see in a cube so
they're<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:04.100> unique<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.580> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
they're kind of a unique in that way in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
they're kind of a unique in that way in
that<00:01:05.850> sense<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.299> edges<00:01:06.689> rounded<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that sense this edges rounded and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
that sense this edges rounded and
whatnot<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.880> basic<00:01:09.180> basic<00:01:09.840> shape

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
whatnot but it's a basic basic shape

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.719 
whatnot but it's a basic basic shape
cube<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:12.150> uses<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.110> strong<00:01:13.830> q4u<00:01:14.430> core

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
cube it uses a really strong q4u core

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.060 
cube it uses a really strong q4u core
which<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.200> video<00:01:16.439> somewhere<00:01:16.740> around<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
which in a video somewhere around to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.950 
which in a video somewhere around to
YouTube<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.670> sure<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> find<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
YouTube I'm sure you can find it it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
YouTube I'm sure you can find it it
actually<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.009> video<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.400> he's<00:01:20.490> slamming

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
actually has a video where he's slamming

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
actually has a video where he's slamming
it<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> hammer<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.280> nothing<00:01:23.280> gets

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it with the hammer and nothing gets

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.090 
it with the hammer and nothing gets
affected<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:26.220> basically<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
affected but that's basically it and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.070 
affected but that's basically it and
let's<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> review

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.570 

all<00:01:35.080> right<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.800> this<00:01:35.980> thing<00:01:36.190> good<00:01:36.400> for

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
all right is this thing good for

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.480 
all right is this thing good for
speedcubing<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.990> gave<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.980> seven

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
speedcubing I gave it a seven

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.730 
speedcubing I gave it a seven
you<00:01:40.180> know<00:01:40.300> this<00:01:40.450> cube<00:01:40.690> gives<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.960> seven<00:01:41.350> well<00:01:41.590> I

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you know this cube gives a seven well I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.680 
you know this cube gives a seven well I
mean<00:01:41.890> while<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.280> very<00:01:42.490> fast<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.180> still<00:01:43.480> pops

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
mean while it's very fast it still pops

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.180 
mean while it's very fast it still pops
if<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.020> can't<00:01:44.200> control<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.620> key<00:01:44.800> very<00:01:45.010> well

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
if you can't control the key very well

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.520 
if you can't control the key very well
now<00:01:46.120> if<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.390> know<00:01:46.540> how<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.780> control<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.260> cube

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
now if you know how to control the cube

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320 
now if you know how to control the cube
then<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.550> you<00:01:48.700> don't<00:01:48.820> have<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.060> worry<00:01:49.210> about

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
then and you don't have to worry about

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.240 
then and you don't have to worry about
turning<00:01:49.810> wrong<00:01:50.140> or<00:01:50.350> popping<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.950> cube<00:01:51.160> is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
turning wrong or popping this cube is

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.540 
turning wrong or popping this cube is
actually<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.610> very<00:01:51.850> very<00:01:52.030> fast<00:01:52.330> cube<00:01:52.600> for<00:01:53.550> you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
actually a very very fast cube for you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.110 
actually a very very fast cube for you
to<00:01:54.700> use<00:01:54.910> but<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:56.320> speech<00:01:56.530> with<00:01:56.680> control

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
to use but that's it speech with control

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.940 
to use but that's it speech with control
without<00:01:58.350> turning<00:01:59.350> rolling<00:01:59.590> with<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.830> almost

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
without turning rolling with I almost

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100 
without turning rolling with I almost
turned<00:02:00.190> wrong<00:02:00.400> right<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.360> it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
turned wrong right there so it's

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.480 
turned wrong right there so it's
definitely<00:02:02.200> geared<00:02:02.650> more<00:02:02.890> towards<00:02:03.310> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
definitely geared more towards the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.670 
definitely geared more towards the
advanced<00:02:03.990> Turner<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.230> guess<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.470> would<00:02:05.560> say

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.590 

actually<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.280> gave<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.000> seven<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.330> this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
actually I gave it a seven because this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.050 
actually I gave it a seven because this
cube<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.020> actually<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:15.310> about<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.610> seven<00:02:15.970> on

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
cube is actually just about a seven on

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.760 
cube is actually just about a seven on
the<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.390> scale<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.840> weight<00:02:17.170> which<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
the on the scale of weight which is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.590 
the on the scale of weight which is
pretty<00:02:17.950> decent<00:02:18.160> for<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.520> cube<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.060> know<00:02:19.450> now

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
pretty decent for a cube you know now

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.540 
pretty decent for a cube you know now
people<00:02:19.810> might<00:02:20.170> not<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.430> know

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
people might not like this you know

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.400 
people might not like this you know
because<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.209> little<00:02:22.480> bit<00:02:22.660> heavier<00:02:23.230> than

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
because it's a little bit heavier than

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.360 
because it's a little bit heavier than
what<00:02:23.470> they're<00:02:23.620> used<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.220> definitely

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
what they're used to it's definitely

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670 
what they're used to it's definitely
something<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.330> used<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:26.290> when<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.530> do

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
something to get used to but when you do

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.410 
something to get used to but when you do
you<00:02:26.860> only<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:27.400> when<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.820> do<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.120> used<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.390> I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
you only like when you do get used to I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.970 
you only like when you do get used to I
think<00:02:28.780> you'll<00:02:28.900> actually<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.709> added

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
think you'll actually like the added

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.410 
think you'll actually like the added
throw<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> weight<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> cube<00:02:31.270> gives

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
throw that the weight of the cube gives

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.949 
throw that the weight of the cube gives
you<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:32.490> personally<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.550> think<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:34.060> really<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
you and personally I think I really like

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.140 
you and personally I think I really like
the<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.350> weight<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.220> cube<00:02:36.400> throws<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.180> feels

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the the weight the cube throws and feels

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.550 
the the weight the cube throws and feels
it's<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.390> cool<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:40.989> almost<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.350> if<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
it's really cool it's almost like if you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's really cool it's almost like if you
don't<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.010> cube<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:42.700> hard<00:02:42.940> with<00:02:43.030> your

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
don't have to cube as hard with your

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.460 
don't have to cube as hard with your
fingers<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.810> way<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.989> kind<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.320> takes

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
fingers because the way it kind of takes

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.150 
fingers because the way it kind of takes
over<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.830> shifting<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> layers<00:02:50.100> why<00:02:51.100> is

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
over the shifting of the layers why is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.920 
over the shifting of the layers why is
this<00:02:51.310> good<00:02:51.489> for<00:02:51.550> your<00:02:51.820> collection<00:02:52.180> well

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
this good for your collection well

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.080 
this good for your collection well
here's<00:02:53.230> why<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.650> gave<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.400> an<00:02:54.850> eighth

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
here's why I gave you this an eighth

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.150 
here's why I gave you this an eighth
novel<00:02:55.510> teen<00:02:55.660> because<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.590> fact<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.100> a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
novel teen because the fact that it's a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.340 
novel teen because the fact that it's a
gas<00:02:57.340> assisted<00:02:57.880> injection<00:02:58.360> molding<00:02:58.750> which

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
gas assisted injection molding which

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.340 
gas assisted injection molding which
makes<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:00.220> piece<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.030> hole<00:03:01.300> not<00:03:02.110> happy

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
makes the piece in one hole not happy

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.050 
makes the piece in one hole not happy
not<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.709> caps<00:03:03.070> actually<00:03:03.640> makes<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
not to have caps actually makes it the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.479 
not to have caps actually makes it the
first<00:03:04.300> cube<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.050> casted<00:03:05.860> fully<00:03:06.130> but

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
first cube that is casted fully but

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.580 
first cube that is casted fully but
hollow<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.600> think<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.930> makes<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.350> very

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
hollow and I think that makes it a very

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.650 
hollow and I think that makes it a very
unique<00:03:08.739> cube<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.190> itself<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.330> fact<00:03:10.570> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
unique cube in itself and the fact that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
unique cube in itself and the fact that
that<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.810> quality<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.410> plastic<00:03:14.800> is<00:03:14.950> really

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that the quality of plastic is really

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.460 
that the quality of plastic is really
strong<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.030> really<00:03:16.239> fast<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.780> think<00:03:17.260> it's<00:03:17.380> just

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
strong and really fast I think it's just

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.490 
strong and really fast I think it's just
a<00:03:17.799> very<00:03:18.489> nice<00:03:18.670> puzzle<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.120> have<00:03:19.350> for<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
a very nice puzzle to have for the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.440 
a very nice puzzle to have for the
collection<00:03:20.890> it's<00:03:21.340> definitely<00:03:21.730> one<00:03:22.299> worth

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
collection it's definitely one worth

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.369 
collection it's definitely one worth
getting

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.170 

cornica<00:03:29.379> I<00:03:29.650> gave<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:30.519> cue<00:03:30.760> benign<00:03:31.000> because

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
cornica I gave this cue benign because

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.470 
cornica I gave this cue benign because
it<00:03:31.540> does<00:03:32.010> cut<00:03:33.010> at<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.280> 45<00:03:33.730> degree<00:03:33.849> angle<00:03:34.030> but

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
it does cut at a 45 degree angle but

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.050 
it does cut at a 45 degree angle but
occasionally<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.079> catches<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.680> could<00:03:35.829> see<00:03:36.060> in

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
occasionally it catches you could see in

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.929 
occasionally it catches you could see in
some<00:03:37.750> spots<00:03:38.079> which<00:03:38.829> is<00:03:38.980> why<00:03:39.129> I<00:03:39.159> gave<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.610> 9

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
some spots which is why I gave it a 9

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.630 
some spots which is why I gave it a 9
but<00:03:40.480> during<00:03:41.019> solving<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.860> don't<00:03:42.040> notice<00:03:42.340> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
but during solving you don't notice this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.020 
but during solving you don't notice this
so<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.099> solves<00:03:45.459> as<00:03:45.579> long<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:45.909> have

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
so in the solves as long as you have

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.300 
so in the solves as long as you have
really<00:03:46.239> good<00:03:46.329> control<00:03:46.659> it's<00:03:46.959> actually<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.560> I

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
really good control it's actually a I

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.710 
really good control it's actually a I
would<00:03:48.760> give<00:03:48.909> it<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.060> 10<00:03:49.209> on<00:03:49.329> corner-cutting

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
would give it a 10 on corner-cutting

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.289 
would give it a 10 on corner-cutting
it's<00:03:50.099> completely<00:03:51.099> fluent<00:03:51.370> really<00:03:51.609> smooth

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.970 

overall<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.840> cube<00:03:59.140> gets<00:03:59.319> an<00:03:59.440> average<00:03:59.590> score

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
overall this cube gets an average score

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.479 
overall this cube gets an average score
of<00:04:00.040> 7.75<00:04:00.940> or<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:02.319> guess<00:04:02.829> he<00:04:02.920> was<00:04:03.129> just<00:04:03.280> saying<00:04:03.400> a

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
of 7.75 or I guess he was just saying a

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.000 
of 7.75 or I guess he was just saying a
seven<00:04:04.000> or<00:04:04.150> an<00:04:04.870> eight<00:04:05.200> if<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.470> rounded<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.889> up

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
seven or an eight if you rounded it up

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.559 
seven or an eight if you rounded it up
this<00:04:06.489> cube<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:06.790> awesome<00:04:07.120> while<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.359> can<00:04:07.540> be

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
this cube is awesome while it can be

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.270 
this cube is awesome while it can be
used<00:04:07.900> for<00:04:08.019> speed<00:04:08.319> cubing<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.859> definitely

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
used for speed cubing it is definitely

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.740 
used for speed cubing it is definitely
geared<00:04:09.489> towards<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.120> advanced<00:04:10.359> control

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
geared towards the advanced control

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.050 
geared towards the advanced control
keyword<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.620> actually<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.040> very<00:04:12.340> fast<00:04:12.760> and
