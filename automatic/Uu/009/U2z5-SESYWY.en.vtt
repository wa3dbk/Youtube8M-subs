00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.000
 in the seventeenth arrondissement of paris 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.440
 the junk dealer cédric fontaine posed his 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.510
 suitcases in this big three piece of 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.460
 100 square meters where he cultivates his taste 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.710
 for diversion and mixing of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.430
 genres between antique objects and furniture 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.170
 design in this apartment typically 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.760
 Parisian haussmannian look 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.800
 found a large living room to 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.169
 soft hues spiced up with pieces 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.449
 contemporary a big stuffed hallway 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.600
 unusual details and a great 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:43.000
 parental room that we liked this 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.110
 fifth floor is the style 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.170
 Haussmann 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.489
 this is the parquet floor the chimneys etc and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.790
 the idea precisely of being able to implant 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.890
 a slightly offbeat decoration in a 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 more traditional place I did some 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.040
 art market studies so that's it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
 start a little like this at birth 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.940
 of my children actually I started to 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.549
 to want to dive a little on 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.379
 on things a little bit farther on 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.580
 the returns a little too to childhood or 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.320
 side a little bit a little nostalgic 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.030
 when and I started at that time 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.920
 month the interested person really has to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.539
 flea market in china have objects that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.789
 were more objects oriented towards 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.799
 children precisely today everything 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.969
 who comes out is often a bit plastic and 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.530
 so that's where we're also on 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.600
 materials for oneself a little more noble his 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 metal finger I hold that I like 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.240
 well what I like is that they have 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 crossed the time 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.229
 a real nostalgic lover of the 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.760
 furniture of yesteryear cédric did compose his 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.760
 living room only with vintage pieces 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.370
 the main room of the living room where 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 sit down so this is this couch 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.670
 patricia urquiola I bought there 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.900
 a decade I like 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.320
 many chairs so you have a 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.420
 bertoia chair that we just bought 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.800
 another to 6 from here was contemporary and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.350
 after you have a lot of small 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.330
 children's chairs so that's a trick 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.980
 I really like the old ones 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.570
 booster in fact in the 50s 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 in the USA this is plastic which 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.350
 who lugs his share all these light 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 so here is my daughter very much like this 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.430
 chair that piece of furniture that was advertised a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 buffet that we just punctuated it's a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.670
 a little art deco buffet that I find in 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 flea market and then after small objects 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.640
 that old bowling balls 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.850
 etc. 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 no matter whatever the matter 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.090
 true value 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.410
 what interests me is the object and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.000
 That's why voters at wholesale 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.209
 when I find stuff at 30 euros 20 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 euros that rex pote'e deco are great 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.200
 nice what the evidence with this old 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.930
 road signs that gives a 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.350
 small offset side to the set for the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 after 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.250
 Cedric plays on natural hues 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.610
 as a common thread in this great 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.610
 living room 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.240
 so here we are in the dining room 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.180
 eat office the chairs ims here 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.230
 frisco kramer chairs on the other side 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.630
 so that's the idea it was also 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 to have some chairs to bet the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.000
 only thing we do is good but 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.560
 no more than 100 kg people on these 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.990
 things there because it was not designed 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.260
 for the era of large formats and 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.640
 big weight so that's saying that I'm at 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.230
 about the size limited to the pot limit 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.740
 to sit on these things there 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.080
 after that can create small breaks 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.120
 but whether it's a classic chair or 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.310
 a chair that has more history 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.750
 or who also have a little bit more 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.310
 more money has died 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.420
 respect the objects what is death 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.100
 who continue to cross the time we 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 note in passing the beautiful candlesticks 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.210
 wooden on the table and the chair 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.990
 high vintage that inspired us a 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.790
 shopping to discover at the end of the visit 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.310
 file in the hallway which also has the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.780
 right to a real decor here 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.610
 the host of the place transgresses the codes 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.850
 to dress his walls a few 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.230
 drollery 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.130
 it was imposed quite quickly to have 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.690
 a big counter so we started from 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
 old military trunk in fact that 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.620
 I signed some time ago we have 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.470
 also positioned his old chairs from 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.750
 theater that I had also hunt there 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.680
 a few years in a flea market that 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.850
 for the little story was dead 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.160
 during a fun fair it's absolutely 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
 great and then after again not 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.290
 bad little small decorative objects 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.110
 hijacked so this baby foot catches on 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.880
 wall in the continuity of the corridor there is 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.980
 old rackets also positioned 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.660
 everywhere on the walls the table football 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.490
 that I find a beautiful object but 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.630
 frankly he plays and it's not 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.790
 possible because of the bars they are 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.170
 all twisted so even a child at the end 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.790
 two minutes he grabbed his ice cream and that 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.570
 does not work and suddenly I'm 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.880
 I'm told, it could still be 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.890
 to be funny at the wall so I did 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.600
 the test I found his conclusion is 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.370
 at the end of the apartment just in 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.160
 colorful children's room face 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.320
 Cedric imagined a parental cocoon more 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.890
 cozy with objects that follow him 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.890
 always 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.110
 symbol of the oppressed in its format 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.160
 in his own juice too because that's the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.010
 wooden board at the top it is 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.210
 really well and well well esquinted that 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.470
 it was a beautiful room in a room 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.570
 so we have all the linens that 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 inside it is a kassala chair 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.660
 so the things that get tired pretty well known 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.840
 in children's design it's a 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.160
 revolving chair here is the stamped it 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.520
 is dated below so it's really 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.870
 a beautiful piece is a bit of a joke 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.980
 all our records I buy small 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.630
 was looking for little chairs but that's 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.460
 true that I really like and I find 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.710
 that it's real decorative objects 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.070
 that I have a book a little referent and to 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.910
 the end of this book there are the ten chairs 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.390
 to have 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.950
 overall so I have to have three 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.080
 or four so he still misses 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.100
 a few some to find at 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.420
 every time these voices there are 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.210
 research and it's stories so 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.650
 that 's what brings a 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.650
 soul to objects what 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.690
 the decor that we have here to reflect then made 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.990
 that we are people of today but 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.740
 which remains a little bit embedded in the 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.970
 nostalgia in the past and 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.970
 and in the child, that's it 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.250
 at cédric links to moult ideas to transplant 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.620
 we loved his collection of chairs 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.150
 designers the wall decoration with a 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.520
 old baby foot or snowshoes 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.930
 retro tennis as well as the multiples 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.880
 wall letters over coins 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.920
 but what inspired our shopping 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.120
 it's the high chair and the pretty ones 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.120
 candlesticks side dining room
