00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.840
 A magic power is in this well 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.240
 Make a wish do we want 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.420
 At the well, it must be said 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.480
 If the echo without delay responds 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.020
 We have what we want 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.540
 I wish 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.500
 (I wish) 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.200
 See the one I like 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.200
 And let him come 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.220
 (And he comes) 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.260
 Soon 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.360
 (Soon) 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.500
 I'm waiting for him 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.220
 (I'm waiting for him) 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.540
 I dream sweet words 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.720
 Soft words 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.620
 (With tender words) 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.800
 That he will say 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 (That he will say) 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.420
 ahahahahah 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.360
 (Ahahahahah) 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.800
 ahahahahah 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.000
 (Ahahahahah) 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.860
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.200

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560
 Ahahahahahahah 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.300
 I wish 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 (I wish) 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 See the one I like 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.800
 May he find me 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 (That he finds me) 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.320
 Soon 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.320
 Soon 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.940
 Oh! 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.780
 Hello 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.280
 Oh 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.440
 Did I scare you? 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 Hold on! 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.300
 Wait, do not run away! 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.480
 Please! 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.380
 O you my dream, listen to my song 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.640
 A song 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.380
 I only have one song 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 For you, O my love 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.500
 A song that fills my heart 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.720
 Hope, happiness 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.260
 On worship 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.100
 This song 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.900
 Said that my soul 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.680
 Is yours forever 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.980
 For you, I proclaim it 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:26.560
 I only have a love song
