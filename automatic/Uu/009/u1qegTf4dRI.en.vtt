to celebrate with this gameplay this is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
to celebrate with this gameplay this is
probably<00:00:40.290> our<00:00:40.500> best<00:00:40.710> EDM<00:00:41.250> gameplay<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.850> far

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
probably our best EDM gameplay so far

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
probably our best EDM gameplay so far
not<00:00:42.239> score<00:00:42.600> wise<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> 52<00:00:43.710> 2<00:00:43.800> 1

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
not score wise that would be the 52 2 1

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
not score wise that would be the 52 2 1
gameplay<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.760> gameplay<00:00:45.210> wise<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.750> go

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
gameplay but gameplay wise because we go

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
gameplay but gameplay wise because we go
45<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.590> two<00:00:46.620> which<00:00:46.800> isn't<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> best<00:00:47.399> score<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
45 and two which isn't the best score it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
45 and two which isn't the best score it
isn't<00:00:48.059> bad<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.989> isn't<00:00:49.410> our<00:00:49.469> best

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
isn't bad at all but it isn't our best

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
isn't bad at all but it isn't our best
score<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:52.050> we're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
score but we don't really well we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
score but we don't really well we're
running<00:00:52.379> spike<00:00:53.309> line<00:00:53.520> counter<00:00:53.789> spy<00:00:53.969> plane<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
running spike line counter spy plane and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.000 
running spike line counter spy plane and
napalm<00:00:54.750> strike<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.289> only<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.739> three

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
napalm strike so we only get like three

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
napalm strike so we only get like three
kills<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.670> air<00:00:56.820> support<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.840> get

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
kills off of our air support and we get

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.389 
kills off of our air support and we get
42<00:00:58.289> gun<00:00:58.559> kills<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
42 gun kills or something like that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.799 
42 gun kills or something like that
which<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.879> quite<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.719> using

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
which is quite good because we're using

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
which is quite good because we're using
the<00:01:01.020> npl<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.530> steady<00:01:01.739> aim<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.039> well<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the npl with steady aim as well so this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.189 
the npl with steady aim as well so this
gameplay<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> quite<00:01:03.600> enjoyable<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> watch

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
gameplay is quite enjoyable to watch

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.570
