look<00:02:56.590> at<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:56.800> check<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.190> out<00:02:57.480> hits<00:02:58.480> this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
look at this check it out hits this

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.540 
look at this check it out hits this
player<00:02:58.959> hits<00:02:59.290> my<00:02:59.470> player<00:02:59.770> and<00:02:59.980> then<00:03:00.100> my<00:03:00.250> player

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
player hits my player and then my player

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.360 
player hits my player and then my player
jumps<00:03:00.940> for<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.209> ball<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:02.230> get<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.530> int<00:03:03.040> so
