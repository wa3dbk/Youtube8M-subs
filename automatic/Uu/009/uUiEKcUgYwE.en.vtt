these<00:00:19.770> guys<00:00:19.830> weren't<00:00:20.160> great<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.580> they

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
these guys weren't great but they

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.550 
these guys weren't great but they
weren't<00:00:21.420> terribly<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:24.930> first<00:00:25.380> thing<00:00:25.500> I

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
weren't terribly there so first thing I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.429 
weren't terribly there so first thing I
notice<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.510> actually<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.869> don't<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.140> force

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
notice is actually we don't really force

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.400 
notice is actually we don't really force
trinkets<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.400> match<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.320> do

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
trinkets this match right we do we do

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.400 
trinkets this match right we do we do
put<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> enough<00:00:31.890> pressure<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> kill

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
put it enough pressure to get the kill

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
put it enough pressure to get the kill
and<00:00:34.410> there's<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> couple<00:00:34.710> different<00:00:34.920> factors

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and there's a couple different factors

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760 
and there's a couple different factors
that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.809> made<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.140> possible<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.500> us<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that I think made it possible for us to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.160 
that I think made it possible for us to
win<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.219> quick<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.670> did<00:00:38.910> well<00:00:39.300> I'd<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
win as quick as we did well I'd say a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130 
win as quick as we did well I'd say a
quick<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:41.250> pretty<00:00:41.370> fast<00:00:41.610> match<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> he<00:00:42.899> will

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
quick I was pretty fast match so he will

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.450 
quick I was pretty fast match so he will
start<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> Warlock<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.190> weren't<00:00:44.370> able

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
start off on the Warlock we weren't able

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
start off on the Warlock we weren't able
to<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> SAP<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.180> mean<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.510> weren't<00:00:45.629> expecting

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to get a SAP I mean we weren't expecting

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
to get a SAP I mean we weren't expecting
honest<00:00:46.289> Matthew<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.059> we<00:00:48.059> start<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
honest Matthew there but we start on the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
honest Matthew there but we start on the
warlock<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.899> further<00:00:49.260> further<00:00:49.860> definition

warlock I further further definition

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
warlock I further further definition
warrants<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> means<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:51.780> price

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
warrants so that means we should price

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.420 
warrants so that means we should price
which<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.350> him<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> can't<00:00:52.980> poly<00:00:53.219> him

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
