00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
you know when you go to restaurants and

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.410 
you know when you go to restaurants and
things<00:04:11.799> like<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.220> eat<00:04:12.579> out<00:04:12.790> most<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
things like that to eat out most of the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360 
things like that to eat out most of the
time<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.780> vegetarian<00:04:14.470> option<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.129> going<00:04:15.310> to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
time the vegetarian option is going to

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.759 
time the vegetarian option is going to
be<00:04:15.459> cheaper<00:04:15.849> than<00:04:16.000> whatever<00:04:16.870> else<00:04:17.229> said<00:04:17.560> there

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
be cheaper than whatever else said there

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.479 
be cheaper than whatever else said there
is<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.430> it's<00:04:18.579> cheaper<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.120> that's<00:04:19.299> good<00:04:19.539> too<00:04:19.780> um

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
