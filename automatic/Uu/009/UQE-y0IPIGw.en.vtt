not the bad things just like dancing and
having<00:03:53.299> fun<00:03:53.419> dance<00:03:54.139> was<00:03:54.260> really<00:03:54.409> boring

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
having fun dance was really boring

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.439 
having fun dance was really boring
because<00:03:55.879> eh<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:57.680> think<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.729> the<00:03:58.909> outcome<00:03:59.329> of

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
because eh I think that the outcome of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.899 
because eh I think that the outcome of
the<00:03:59.569> dance<00:03:59.750> heavily<00:04:00.319> depends<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.519> deejay

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
the dance heavily depends on the deejay

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.009 
the dance heavily depends on the deejay
how<00:04:02.479> like<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.780> deejay<00:04:03.079> did<00:04:03.259> and<00:04:03.470> stuff<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.069> so

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
how like the deejay did and stuff and so

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.499 
how like the deejay did and stuff and so
our<00:04:06.019> deejay<00:04:06.560> played<00:04:06.859> like<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.250> worst<00:04:07.729> songs

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
our deejay played like the worst songs

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.619 
our deejay played like the worst songs
ever<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:09.620> in<00:04:10.069> my<00:04:10.579> opinion<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.239> think<00:04:11.449> there

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
ever like in my opinion I think there

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.420 
ever like in my opinion I think there
should<00:04:11.659> have<00:04:11.959> been<00:04:12.199> more<00:04:12.500> pitbull<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.220> there

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
should have been more pitbull in there

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.610 
should have been more pitbull in there
