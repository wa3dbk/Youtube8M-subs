again<00:01:41.520> muscle<00:01:41.910> but<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> depends<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.660> how<00:01:43.350> much

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
again muscle but it depends on how much

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.060 
again muscle but it depends on how much
muscle<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> need<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.130> gain<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.550> your<00:01:44.610> class

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

muscle you need to gain for your class
it<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.220> definitely<00:01:47.610> help<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.530> opinion

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it will definitely help in my opinion

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.650 
it will definitely help in my opinion
though<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.340> bikini<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.360> need<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
though for bikini you don't need that

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.480 
though for bikini you don't need that
much<00:01:54.810> muscle<00:01:55.050> mass<00:01:55.289> it's<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:56.039> not<00:01:57.200> necessary

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
much muscle mass it's just not necessary

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.779 
much muscle mass it's just not necessary
so<00:01:59.490> personally<00:02:00.119> no<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
so personally no I don't think that you

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.230 
so personally no I don't think that you
need<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> everyone<00:02:05.100> has<00:02:06.000> their

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
need to do that but everyone has their

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.840 
need to do that but everyone has their
own<00:02:06.270> opinion<00:02:07.130> everyone's<00:02:08.130> entitled<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.700> do

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that with that one and I'll definitely

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
that with that one and I'll definitely
have<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.660> Canadian<00:02:19.079> bacon<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
have to with Canadian bacon there is a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.600

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
course and I guess my answer was right

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.180 
course and I guess my answer was right
there

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.640 

which<00:02:35.190> was<00:02:35.460> really<00:02:35.700> focused<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.320> products<00:02:37.320> for

we got a few up now and they'll have
quality<00:02:42.660> gradients<00:02:43.020> they're<00:02:44.010> equipped<00:02:44.340> I'll

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
quality gradients they're equipped I'll

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.220 
quality gradients they're equipped I'll
use<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.570> them<00:02:45.720> every<00:02:46.080> day<00:02:47.900> she's<00:02:48.900> gonna<00:02:49.080> go

back to doing clothing or focusing more
on<00:02:51.840> clearly<00:02:52.230> production<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> few

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
on clearly production now for a few

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.030 
on clearly production now for a few
moments<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.390> taking<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.320> hold<00:02:55.710> off<00:02:55.860> on

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
moments and taking a little hold off on

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.750 
moments and taking a little hold off on
supplements<00:02:57.920> for<00:02:58.920> my<00:02:59.070> understanding<00:02:59.670> anyway

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
supplements for my understanding anyway

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.130 
supplements for my understanding anyway
so<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.210> could<00:03:00.330> always<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.600> something

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so there could always be something

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.650 
so there could always be something
that's<00:03:01.770> being<00:03:02.100> put<00:03:02.520> together<00:03:02.670> right<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that's being put together right now and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.840 
that's being put together right now and
one<00:03:04.110> heard<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.620> sure<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.430> we'll<00:03:05.610> go<00:03:05.700> into

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
one heard this in sure and we'll go into
