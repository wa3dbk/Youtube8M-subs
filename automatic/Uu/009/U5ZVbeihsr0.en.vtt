deadlifts<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.519> now<00:03:51.700> because<00:03:52.269> i<00:03:52.989> was<00:03:53.170> training

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
deadlifts for now because i was training

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.979 
deadlifts for now because i was training
conventional<00:03:54.069> before<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.630> haven't<00:03:55.900> even

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
conventional before and I haven't even

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.430 
conventional before and I haven't even
trained<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.680> mow<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:58.060> seem<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.660> be<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:58.840> as

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
trained to mow and I seem to be just as

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.250 
trained to mow and I seem to be just as
strong<00:03:59.560> without<00:04:00.010> any<00:04:00.310> training<00:04:00.609> so<00:04:01.260> little

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
strong without any training so little

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.470 
strong without any training so little
light<00:04:02.410> bulb<00:04:02.680> goes<00:04:02.889> up<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:03.130> my<00:04:03.220> head<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.730> train

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
light bulb goes up in my head I train

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.520 
light bulb goes up in my head I train
the<00:04:05.260> new<00:04:05.799> sumo<00:04:06.130> stance<00:04:06.959> more<00:04:07.959> than

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the new sumo stance more than

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.729 
the new sumo stance more than
conventional<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.400> think<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.030> could<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.329> stronger

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
conventional I think I could be stronger

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.650 
conventional I think I could be stronger
with<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.859> sumo<00:04:12.160> stance<00:04:12.430> which<00:04:13.269> isn't<00:04:13.569> even

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
with the sumo stance which isn't even

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.300 
with the sumo stance which isn't even
really<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:14.079> hundred<00:04:14.500> percent<00:04:14.590> sumo<00:04:15.100> stance

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
really a hundred percent sumo stance

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.060 
really a hundred percent sumo stance
it's<00:04:15.670> like<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> hybrid<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.169> close<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.769> would

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it's like a hybrid it's a close I would

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.340 
it's like a hybrid it's a close I would
call<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.400> closed<00:04:18.729> stance<00:04:18.760> sumo<00:04:19.660> stance<00:04:19.930> that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
call it a closed stance sumo stance that

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.950 
call it a closed stance sumo stance that
makes<00:04:21.310> sense<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:22.389> yeah<00:04:22.570> I'm<00:04:22.630> going<00:04:22.810> to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
makes sense but yeah I'm going to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.640 
makes sense but yeah I'm going to
continue<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:24.669> pull<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.090> way<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.660> hopefully

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
continue to pull this way and hopefully

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.640 
continue to pull this way and hopefully
next<00:04:27.010> week<00:04:27.250> I'll<00:04:27.460> be<00:04:27.490> able<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.850> pull<00:04:28.120> for<00:04:28.810> 15<00:04:29.229> 45

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
next week I'll be able to pull for 15 45

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.240 
next week I'll be able to pull for 15 45
and<00:04:30.130> then<00:04:30.789> move<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.419> from<00:04:31.659> there<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.260> another

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
and then move on from there and another

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.380 
and then move on from there and another
reason<00:04:33.460> why<00:04:33.729> I<00:04:33.789> don't<00:04:33.940> think<00:04:34.090> my<00:04:34.120> dell

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
reason why I don't think my dell

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
going up is because literally my top set

going up is because literally my top set
best<00:04:39.410> set<00:04:39.650> ever<00:04:39.730> without<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.940> belt<00:04:41.240> for<00:04:41.780> five

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
best set ever without a belt for five

best set ever without a belt for five
reps<00:04:42.320> regardless<00:04:42.920> of<00:04:43.070> body<00:04:43.250> weight<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.880> think

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
reps regardless of body weight I think

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.320 
reps regardless of body weight I think
is<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.410> 425<00:04:45.410> for<00:04:45.740> 5<00:04:45.920> or<00:04:46.250> 4<00:04:46.460> 30<00:04:46.670> right<00:04:47.030> around

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
is a 425 for 5 or 4 30 right around

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.370 
is a 425 for 5 or 4 30 right around
there<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:49.000> was<00:04:51.010> around<00:04:52.010> 180<00:04:52.610> or<00:04:53.180> 185<00:04:53.660> one<00:04:54.170> did

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
there and was around 180 or 185 one did

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.130 
there and was around 180 or 185 one did
that<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:55.090> I'm<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.360> right<00:04:56.540> there<00:04:56.780> already

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
that so I'm like right there already

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.070 
that so I'm like right there already
pretty<00:04:57.530> much<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.070> but<00:04:59.000> my<00:04:59.120> bench<00:04:59.390> and<00:04:59.690> my<00:04:59.780> Swan

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
pretty much so but my bench and my Swan

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.830 
pretty much so but my bench and my Swan
are<00:05:00.260> way<00:05:00.710> behind<00:05:01.070> my<00:05:01.430> best<00:05:01.700> top<00:05:01.940> five<00:05:02.210> rep<00:05:02.540> sets
