thing on some lot of people's minds was
that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.070> guess<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.700> than<00:01:08.760> anything<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
that I guess more than anything just to
look<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.170> very<00:01:10.380> young<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> beard<00:01:11.220> which

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
a bit played into it as a major part of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
a bit played into it as a major part of
it<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> similar<00:01:18.000> sort<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.240> size

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it and it's got a similar sort of size

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
it and it's got a similar sort of size
in<00:01:18.780> terms<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.080> his<00:01:19.200> height<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.409> everything

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
in terms of his height and everything

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.690 
in terms of his height and everything
and<00:01:21.140> there's<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> underdog<00:01:22.650> story<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and there's the underdog story I just

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640 
and there's the underdog story I just
think<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.330> bigger<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.470> bigger

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
think that the bigger the bigger

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.289

it opens up a whole new can of worms

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.909 
it opens up a whole new can of worms
because<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.900> whole<00:04:19.049> thing<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.380> well<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.799> know

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919

thing I don't know I maybe I mean I

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.720 
thing I don't know I maybe I mean I
think<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.890> other<00:05:16.010> thing<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.220> what<00:05:16.430> T<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.640> it

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730

shown Dorothy a girly title run

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.719 
shown Dorothy a girly title run
basically<00:05:29.810> where<00:05:30.080> he<00:05:30.430> where<00:05:31.430> he<00:05:31.580> basically

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
basically where he where he basically

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.520 
basically where he where he basically
elevates<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.660> belt<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:33.080> little<00:05:33.290> bit<00:05:33.410> because

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
elevates the belt a little bit because

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.750 
elevates the belt a little bit because
that's<00:05:33.800> one<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.130> things<00:05:34.160> I<00:05:34.400> struggle<00:05:34.729> with

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
that's one of the things I struggle with

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.330 
that's one of the things I struggle with
I<00:05:34.880> think<00:05:35.030> is<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:35.770> Magnus<00:05:36.770> was<00:05:36.860> champion<00:05:37.280> he

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
I think is that Magnus was champion he

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.310 
I think is that Magnus was champion he
just<00:05:37.520> didn't<00:05:37.700> win<00:05:37.880> anything<00:05:38.120> cleanly<00:05:38.990> was<00:05:39.229> the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
just didn't win anything cleanly was the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.080 
just didn't win anything cleanly was the
hill<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.530> always<00:05:39.770> cheated<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.669> win<00:05:40.700> but<00:05:40.940> not

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
hill that always cheated to win but not

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.120 
hill that always cheated to win but not
just<00:05:41.300> heated<00:05:41.570> but<00:05:41.720> had<00:05:41.960> people<00:05:42.770> helped<00:05:42.950> him

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
just heated but had people helped him

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.500 
just heated but had people helped him
win<00:05:43.310> all<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.669> time<00:05:43.700> which<00:05:44.030> i<00:05:44.120> think<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
win all the time which i think is the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.120 
win all the time which i think is the
bigger<00:05:44.660> problem<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:45.770> meant<00:05:45.919> that<00:05:45.979> when

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
bigger problem and it meant that when

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.860 
bigger problem and it meant that when
the<00:05:46.250> title<00:05:46.550> change<00:05:46.760> came<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.450> meant<00:05:47.690> less

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
the title change came it meant less

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.570 
the title change came it meant less
because<00:05:48.110> Magnus<00:05:48.560> estar<00:05:48.860> train<00:05:49.100> hasn't<00:05:49.310> been

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
because Magnus estar train hasn't been
