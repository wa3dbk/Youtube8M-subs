00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
notice a difference between them when

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.910 
notice a difference between them when
Rainbow<00:01:43.920> wants<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> prank<00:01:44.640> Fluttershy<00:01:45.240> Pinkie

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
Rainbow wants to prank Fluttershy Pinkie

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.289 
Rainbow wants to prank Fluttershy Pinkie
immediately<00:01:46.920> puts<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.280> stop<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.850> saying

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
immediately puts a stop to it saying

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
immediately puts a stop to it saying
that<00:01:48.360> Fluttershy<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.380> sensitive<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that Fluttershy is very sensitive and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
that Fluttershy is very sensitive and
that<00:01:50.280> she<00:01:50.430> doesn't<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.000> hurt<00:01:51.210> anyone's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that she doesn't want to hurt anyone's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
that she doesn't want to hurt anyone's
feelings<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> pinkies

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
feelings so we can see that pinkies

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
feelings so we can see that pinkies
attempts<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.840> pranking<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.470> only<00:01:55.829> because

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
attempts at pranking are only because

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
attempts at pranking are only because
she<00:01:56.399> wants<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> spread<00:01:57.149> joy<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
she wants to spread joy and not just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
she wants to spread joy and not just
from<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> desire<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> good<00:01:59.640> laugh<00:01:59.820> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
from a desire to have a good laugh this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
from a desire to have a good laugh this
makes<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> vast<00:02:01.740> contrast<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.729> comparing

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
makes for a vast contrast when comparing

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.870 
makes for a vast contrast when comparing
her<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> Gilda<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.710> introduction<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.460> Gilda

her to Gilda the introduction of Gilda

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
her to Gilda the introduction of Gilda
is<00:02:06.060> interesting<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.140> makes<00:02:07.320> me

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is interesting because it makes me

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
is interesting because it makes me
rather<00:02:07.649> curious<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.459> her<00:02:08.610> history<00:02:08.789> with

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
too hard to believe that Gilda could

only after this point that pinkie

extreme measures I can remember what I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.420 
extreme measures I can remember what I
was<00:03:54.960> thinking<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:55.890> when<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.130> started

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
was thinking here back when I started

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.520 
was thinking here back when I started
watching<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.150> episode<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.960> first<00:03:58.170> time

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
watching this episode for the first time

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.710 
watching this episode for the first time
and<00:03:58.830> seeing<00:03:59.640> all<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> pranks<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.630> were

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and seeing all the pranks that were

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.690 
and seeing all the pranks that were
being<00:04:00.930> pulled<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.470> Gilda<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.160> seemed<00:04:02.490> like

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
being pulled on Gilda it seemed like

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.640 
being pulled on Gilda it seemed like
such<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> predictable<00:04:03.660> turn<00:04:03.960> for<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.320> story

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
such a predictable turn for the story

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.130 
such a predictable turn for the story
but<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.490> was<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> little<00:04:06.330> surprised<00:04:06.840> at

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
but I was actually a little surprised at

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.800 
but I was actually a little surprised at
how<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.530> turned<00:04:07.830> out<00:04:08.100> when<00:04:09.000> Gilda<00:04:09.450> arrives

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
how this turned out when Gilda arrives

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.480 
how this turned out when Gilda arrives
at<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.140> party<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.770> doesn't<00:04:11.070> take<00:04:11.220> long<00:04:11.250> for

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
at the party it doesn't take long for

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.520 
at the party it doesn't take long for
her<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.940> show<00:04:12.180> her<00:04:12.420> frustration<00:04:13.170> at<00:04:13.290> all<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
her to show her frustration at all the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.099 
her to show her frustration at all the
ponies<00:04:13.770> laughing<00:04:14.370> at<00:04:14.459> her<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:15.300> seems<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.930> me

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
ponies laughing at her it seems to me

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.020 
ponies laughing at her it seems to me
that<00:04:16.140> she<00:04:16.500> takes<00:04:16.799> offense<00:04:17.250> from<00:04:17.459> others<00:04:17.760> very

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
that she takes offense from others very

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.050 
that she takes offense from others very
easily<00:04:18.470> but<00:04:19.470> even<00:04:19.739> aside<00:04:20.040> from<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.580> she<00:04:20.940> is

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
easily but even aside from that she is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.120 
easily but even aside from that she is
still<00:04:21.299> being<00:04:21.570> rather<00:04:21.870> insensitive<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.830> spike

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
still being rather insensitive to spike

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.550 
still being rather insensitive to spike
by<00:04:23.310> bumping<00:04:23.790> him<00:04:23.940> out<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> way<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.780> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
by bumping him out of the way and to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.200 
by bumping him out of the way and to
rarity<00:04:26.010> when<00:04:26.160> taking<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.729> tail

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
rarity when taking the tail

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.840 
rarity when taking the tail
before<00:04:27.479> she<00:04:27.600> gets<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.900> chance<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.650> when<00:04:29.430> Gilda

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
before she gets a chance and when Gilda

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.790 
before she gets a chance and when Gilda
has<00:04:30.000> reached<00:04:30.270> her<00:04:30.509> limit<00:04:30.539> she<00:04:31.110> goes<00:04:31.289> all<00:04:31.560> out

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
has reached her limit she goes all out

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.830 
has reached her limit she goes all out
on<00:04:31.979> Pinkie<00:04:32.400> Pie<00:04:32.580> believing<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.330> pinkie<00:04:33.720> had

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
on Pinkie Pie believing that pinkie had

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.230 
on Pinkie Pie believing that pinkie had
set<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.259> party<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.800> only<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.430> humiliate<00:04:36.030> her

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
set this party up only to humiliate her

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.570 
set this party up only to humiliate her
and<00:04:36.479> this<00:04:37.259> actually<00:04:37.830> brought<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.099> moment<00:04:38.520> of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
and this actually brought a moment of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.550 
and this actually brought a moment of
surprise<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.360> me<00:04:39.479> when<00:04:39.630> Rainbow<00:04:40.110> declares

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
surprise for me when Rainbow declares

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.320 
surprise for me when Rainbow declares
that<00:04:40.650> she<00:04:40.830> was<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.400> one<00:04:41.520> who<00:04:41.580> set<00:04:41.940> up<00:04:42.030> all<00:04:42.180> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that she was the one who set up all the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.050 
that she was the one who set up all the
pranks<00:04:42.599> it<00:04:43.560> would<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:43.860> been<00:04:44.039> very<00:04:44.069> easy<00:04:44.789> for

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
pranks it would have been very easy for

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.550 
pranks it would have been very easy for
the<00:04:45.150> writers<00:04:45.509> to<00:04:45.539> just<00:04:45.900> create<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.289> situation

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
the writers to just create a situation

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.620 
the writers to just create a situation
where<00:04:47.069> pinkie<00:04:47.729> had<00:04:47.849> been<00:04:48.030> setting<00:04:48.360> up<00:04:48.449> all

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
where pinkie had been setting up all

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.540 
where pinkie had been setting up all
these<00:04:48.810> pranks<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.440> getting<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> exact<00:04:50.280> same

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
these pranks and getting the exact same

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.939 
these pranks and getting the exact same
reaction<00:04:50.819> out<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.300> Gilda<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.710> nice<00:04:52.919> to

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
reaction out of Gilda but it's nice to

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.770 
reaction out of Gilda but it's nice to
see<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.400> they<00:04:53.669> actually<00:04:53.699> threw<00:04:54.330> in<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.569> very

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
see that they actually threw in a very

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.900 
see that they actually threw in a very
believable<00:04:55.169> twist<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.099> story<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.520> works

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
believable twist to the story that works

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.629 
believable twist to the story that works
rather<00:04:57.180> well<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.900> pinkie<00:04:58.860> actually<00:04:59.280> states

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
rather well and pinkie actually states

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.909 
rather well and pinkie actually states
that<00:04:59.849> she<00:05:00.030> didn't<00:05:00.419> have<00:05:00.570> any<00:05:00.870> ill<00:05:01.199> intent<00:05:01.680> when

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that she didn't have any ill intent when

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.189 
that she didn't have any ill intent when
setting<00:05:02.280> up<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.580> party<00:05:03.030> she<00:05:03.750> was<00:05:03.870> only

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
setting up this party she was only

friends in Ponyville I also started to

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.010 
friends in Ponyville I also started to
notice<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.310> trend<00:06:02.340> with<00:06:02.969> Gilda's<00:06:03.419> reactions

seeing her take offense so quickly made

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.050 
seeing her take offense so quickly made
me<00:06:07.169> realize<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:07.860> Gilda<00:06:08.310> is<00:06:08.460> actually<00:06:08.849> rather

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
me realize that Gilda is actually rather

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.050 
me realize that Gilda is actually rather
sensitive<00:06:10.039> similar<00:06:11.039> to<00:06:11.219> how<00:06:11.370> Fluttershy<00:06:12.000> is

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
sensitive similar to how Fluttershy is

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.029

the<00:06:12.719> difference<00:06:13.169> between<00:06:13.320> them<00:06:13.800> is<00:06:13.919> that

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
the difference between them is that

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.070 
the difference between them is that
Fluttershy<00:06:14.669> reacts<00:06:15.090> by<00:06:15.330> drawing<00:06:15.659> into

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
Fluttershy reacts by drawing into

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.810 
Fluttershy reacts by drawing into
herself<00:06:16.259> when<00:06:16.710> she<00:06:16.860> feels<00:06:17.099> threatened<00:06:17.610> and

herself when she feels threatened and

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.420 
herself when she feels threatened and
Gilda<00:06:18.270> seems<00:06:18.570> to<00:06:18.750> fight<00:06:18.960> back<00:06:19.289> but<00:06:19.620> with<00:06:20.190> both

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
of these characters we can see that they

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.200 
of these characters we can see that they
take<00:06:22.650> what<00:06:22.860> others<00:06:23.190> say<00:06:23.460> about<00:06:23.490> them<00:06:23.940> quite

seriously and in Gilda's case she tends

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.909 
seriously and in Gilda's case she tends
to<00:06:27.270> assume<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.870> worst<00:06:28.169> if<00:06:28.409> there<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.680> any

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
to assume the worst if there is any

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.159 
to assume the worst if there is any
possibility<00:06:29.580> of<00:06:29.909> others<00:06:30.270> making<00:06:30.659> fun<00:06:30.870> of<00:06:30.900> her

I can see a lot of possibilities for
stories<00:06:34.259> here<00:06:34.620> both<00:06:35.430> with<00:06:35.460> Gilda's<00:06:36.210> past<00:06:36.539> and
