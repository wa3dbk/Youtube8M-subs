sets<00:04:24.140> right<00:04:24.350> here<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.130> could<00:04:25.310> move<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.730> a

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
sets right here you could move it to a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.520 
sets right here you could move it to a
different<00:04:25.910> position<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.720> wanted<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.230> trait

are<00:04:30.530> right<00:04:30.710> there<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.700> course<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:31.940> can

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
are right there and of course you can

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.340 
are right there and of course you can
see<00:04:32.450> how<00:04:33.140> this<00:04:33.670> mounts<00:04:34.670> right<00:04:34.730> here<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.350> this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
see how this mounts right here the this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.280 
see how this mounts right here the this
thing<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:36.920> will<00:04:37.460> slide<00:04:37.790> across<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.870> know

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
thing here will slide across so you know

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.170 
thing here will slide across so you know
some<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.530> them<00:04:39.650> are<00:04:39.770> going<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.920> be<00:04:39.980> wider<00:04:40.310> this

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
some of them are going to be wider this

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.530 
some of them are going to be wider this
is<00:04:41.330> probably<00:04:41.600> as<00:04:41.720> wide<00:04:41.930> as<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.140> gets<00:04:42.530> on<00:04:43.210> on<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
is probably as wide as it gets on on the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.260 
is probably as wide as it gets on on the
mount<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.100> can<00:04:46.310> put<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> big<00:04:46.730> engine<00:04:47.150> on

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
mount so you can put a big engine on

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.570 
mount so you can put a big engine on
here<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:48.320> can<00:04:48.500> see<00:04:48.680> how<00:04:48.800> nice<00:04:49.040> this<00:04:49.250> little

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
quite a bit of work on the engine stand

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.950
