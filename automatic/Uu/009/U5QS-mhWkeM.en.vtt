that hole was a retaining clip on this
vehicle<00:00:45.550> it's<00:00:45.670> missing<00:00:45.970> though<00:00:46.089> so<00:00:46.540> basically

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
vehicle it's missing though so basically

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.910 
vehicle it's missing though so basically
this<00:00:47.170> bushing<00:00:47.530> just<00:00:48.089> pulls<00:00:49.089> out<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.769> can

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
this bushing just pulls out and you can

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
this bushing just pulls out and you can
place<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.250> on<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.399> side<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:56.170> basically

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
place it on the side and then basically

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:34.070 
place it on the side and then basically
just

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.920 

Kasey's<00:01:35.080> aside

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.859 

now<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:42.070> we<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.789> lift<00:01:43.090> up<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.420> piece<00:01:43.689> of

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
now this we just lift up this piece of

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.330 
now this we just lift up this piece of
bumper<00:01:44.020> here<00:01:44.350> lately

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
bumper here lately

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:53.270 
bumper here lately
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:02:11.370> headlights<00:02:12.370> at<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> wiggle

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.780 

so<00:02:54.280> now<00:02:54.460> on<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.510> back<00:02:55.690> here<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:57.520> have<00:02:57.550> our

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so now on the back here we have our

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.660 
so now on the back here we have our
blinkers<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:58.900> we<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.430> our<00:03:00.430> main

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
blinkers and then we have our main

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.460 
blinkers and then we have our main
headlight<00:03:01.090> which<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.600> right<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:01.780> so

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
headlight which is right here so

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.740 
headlight which is right here so
basically<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.980> see<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.340> back<00:03:03.540> here<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.630> is

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
basically you see on the back here it is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.230 
basically you see on the back here it is
this<00:03:05.110> black<00:03:05.320> piece<00:03:05.650> here<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:07.200> twist<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
this black piece here you twist that you

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.640 
this black piece here you twist that you
loosen<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.630> then<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.140> pick<00:03:11.380> up<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
loosen that and then you pick up the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.340 
loosen that and then you pick up the
retaining<00:03:12.070> clip<00:03:12.250> here<00:03:12.930> pull<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.020> out<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
retaining clip here pull that out of the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.500 
retaining clip here pull that out of the
way<00:03:15.960> here<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.950> that's<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:19.680> now<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:20.740> have

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
way here and that's that now we have

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.680 
way here and that's that now we have
might<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.540> easier<00:03:23.020> actually<00:03:24.240> put<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:25.450> back

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
might be easier actually put that back

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.410 
might be easier actually put that back
in<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.360> tighten<00:03:28.900> that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.730 

get<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.660> clip<00:03:35.200> out<00:03:35.350> there<00:03:37.380> pull<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.530> piece

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
get the clip out there pull this piece

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.600 
get the clip out there pull this piece
out<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:40.270> that's<00:03:40.600> how<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.780> bullet<00:03:41.110> comes<00:03:41.290> out

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
out and that's how the bullet comes out

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.170 
out and that's how the bullet comes out
and<00:03:42.610> then<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.990> put<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:44.800> back<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.910> same

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
and then to put it back in it's the same

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.860 
and then to put it back in it's the same
thing<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:48.250> just<00:03:48.550> take<00:03:48.820> this<00:03:49.000> piece<00:03:49.270> you<00:03:49.630> stick

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
thing you just take this piece you stick

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.950 
thing you just take this piece you stick
the<00:03:49.960> bulb<00:03:50.170> through<00:03:51.210> attach<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.390> wire<00:03:52.540> harness

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
the bulb through attach the wire harness

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.530 
the bulb through attach the wire harness
and<00:03:53.410> then<00:03:53.800> stick<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.190> back<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:55.210> put<00:03:55.510> your

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and then stick it back in you put your

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.450 
and then stick it back in you put your
bulb<00:03:55.840> grease<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.290> there<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:58.120> up<00:03:58.360> here

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
bulb grease in there and then up here

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.850 
bulb grease in there and then up here
this<00:04:00.460> screw<00:04:00.820> here<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.050> twist<00:04:02.320> this<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
this screw here you can twist this and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220 
this screw here you can twist this and
that's<00:04:03.580> how<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:03.940> adjust<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.780> bulb

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
that's how you adjust the bulb

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.490 
that's how you adjust the bulb
once<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.820> they're<00:04:07.000> not<00:04:07.140> too<00:04:08.140> high<00:04:08.290> up

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
once it's in so they're not too high up

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.590 
once it's in so they're not too high up
you<00:04:08.650> don't<00:04:08.740> want<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> bind<00:04:09.100> anybody<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:10.480> know
