00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 to get started doing the first loop 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 the resulting loop and I dial 5 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 next first 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 connect the loop with the latter in a ring with 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.529
 using a connecting column case 3 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.590
 lift loops that are equal to one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.480
 double crochet and further turned out 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.950
 ring see three double crochet 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 ring grab working thread on 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.989
 hook 3 loops grab working thread 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.449
 I knit 2 loops I capture the worker 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 thread and the remaining engine is one 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.300
 double crochet second column with 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.300
 nakidom 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.659
 and the third column from the ring sc sc 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 grabbing a working thread on the hook 3 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.189
 loops 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.700
 I knit 2 loops and once again 2 loops 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:22.880
 Further I do 2 air loops and in a ring 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.880
 I see now 4 double crochets 1 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.399
 2 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.410
 Tory 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:44.049
 4 2 air loops and still see in the ring 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.049
 4 double crochets 1 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 2 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.830
 you 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:08.320
 4 again two air loops and last 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:08.320
 4 double crochets in the same ring 12 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.270
 34 this is the first row now 13 peak 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.420
 air it will be beach ca 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.780
 expand work and brew out of 2 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:33.640
 air loops right over this 2 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:37.410
 double crochet 1 2 2 air loops 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:47.530
 and in the same arch 2 more double crochets 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:50.770
 1 2 further I knit 4 air loops 1 2 3 4 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.270
 now in the arch of 2 air loops will 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.820
 knit surround column surround column 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.340
 I will knit and 7 nakida and so I do 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.930
 nakid to the point of injection 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:15.940
 I capture a working thread I take out once 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:19.150
 two three 4 5 6 7 now grab 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 workers and all the loops on the hook tying 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.950
 fold and fasten this volumetric column with 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.730
 nakidom 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.440
 the number of nakidov can be different 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.600
 minimum of the riaa maximum how much 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.340
 want in this case a long time ago that I will 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.040
 knit 7 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.510
 nakidov each volumetric column further 4 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.120
 air loops and the arch of 2 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.600
 air loops tying 2 columns with 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.530
 nakida two air loops and 2 columns 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.530
 double crochet 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.360
 there will look like the second row 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.640
 now do 3 air loops it will be 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.890
 pancake 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.500
 expand the work and see the third row 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.790
 for this i brew from 2 air loops 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:19.440
 I see as usual 2 double crochets 2 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.440
 air loops 2 double crochets 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:32.800
 now pay attention 6 air 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:34.990
 loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 and in the arch of 4 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.670
 air loop knit one volume 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:48.160
 column again it consists of me 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:52.480
 seven nakida 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and all loops on 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.680
 hook knit at once and fasten 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.840
 further do 3 air loops and in 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:13.000
 the next arch of 4 air loops 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:19.780
 I knit volumetric column 1 2 3 4 5 6 more 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.320
 times six seven and knit all the loops on 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:29.410
 hook we attach further case 6 air 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:32.290
 loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 and at the end as usual 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.860
 in the arch of 2 air loops I see 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:40.140
 two double crochet 2 air loops 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.140
 2 double crochets 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.850
 so I got three rows 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:58.160
 4 row do 3 air loops this stove 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.650
 I deploy the work at first as usual in 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:06.350
 I knit an arch from 2 air loops 2 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:12.199
 double crochet 2 air loops 2 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:15.080
 double crochet now draw 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:22.789
 attention that I do 8 air loops 1 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:27.220
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cooking from 6 air 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.220
 loops and see a volumetric bar 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.860
 grandfather 3 air loops further the bark of 3 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.180
 air loops see 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.180
 volume bar 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:05.509
 3 air loops and cooking and 6 air loops 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.509
 loops knit volumetric column 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.850
 8 air loops 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.210
 and at the end like the usual brew of 2 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.750
 air stitches knit 2 columns with 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.440
 nakida 2 air loops 2 columns with 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.440
 nakidom 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.460
 this way 4 rows are obtained
