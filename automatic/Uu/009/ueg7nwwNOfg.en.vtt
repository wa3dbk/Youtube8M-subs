00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
way through another big part of men's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.920 
way through another big part of men's
hair<00:01:10.170> styling<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.640> sideburn<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.659> men

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
hair styling is the sideburn some men

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.859 
hair styling is the sideburn some men
lose<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> hair<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.299> sparse

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
lose a lot of hair or have really sparse

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
lose a lot of hair or have really sparse
growth<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
growth in here so you might have to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300 
growth in here so you might have to
overcompensate<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.290> cut<00:01:19.560> everything<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
overcompensate in your cut everything is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
overcompensate in your cut everything is
not<00:01:20.490> one-dimensional<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.869> has<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> be

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
not one-dimensional it has to be

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
not one-dimensional it has to be
three-dimensional<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> keep

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
three-dimensional so I'm going to keep

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
three-dimensional so I'm going to keep
this<00:01:24.840> area<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.580> Richard

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this area just as it is because Richard

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
this area just as it is because Richard
likes<00:01:27.090> his<00:01:27.330> sideburns<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:29.009> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
likes his sideburns and he also has just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
likes his sideburns and he also has just
a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.579> thinning<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.329> through<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.409> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
a little thinning in through here so we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.780 
a little thinning in through here so we
don't<00:01:31.680> want<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> take<00:01:32.040> anything<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> there

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
don't want to take anything out of there

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
don't want to take anything out of there
because<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> hole<00:01:33.630> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
because we're going to have a hole so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
because we're going to have a hole so
it's<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.700> you're<00:01:36.000> cutting<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's not just because you're cutting in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's not just because you're cutting in
here<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.200> cutting<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.880> start

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
here and cutting there I like to start

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
here and cutting there I like to start
in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> rear<00:01:39.720> where<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> male<00:01:40.470> pattern

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
in the rear where the male pattern

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
in the rear where the male pattern
baldness<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
baldness is because this is really the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.260 
baldness is because this is really the
trouble<00:01:43.229> area<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
trouble area with the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.910 
trouble area with the
and<00:01:44.659> everything<00:01:44.990> else<00:01:45.109> so<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.710> going<00:01:45.859> to

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
and everything else so this is going to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.520 
and everything else so this is going to
tell<00:01:46.250> me<00:01:46.490> what<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> length<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.929> going<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.409> be
