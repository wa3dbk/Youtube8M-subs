00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
in the back how do you make sure you're

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.839 
in the back how do you make sure you're
getting<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> all<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.400> around<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
getting it all the way around if you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.789 
getting it all the way around if you
have<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.970> revolving<00:02:12.780> Tree<00:02:12.989> State<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.560> thing

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
have a revolving Tree State one thing

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.190 
have a revolving Tree State one thing
that<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.970> you're<00:02:15.150> placing<00:02:15.599> is

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
that you do when you're placing is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.770 
that you do when you're placing is
always<00:02:16.920> thinking<00:02:17.430> threes<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.480> three

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
always thinking threes with three

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.809 
always thinking threes with three
ornaments<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.340> terms<00:02:20.610> of

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
ornaments and so think in terms of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.210 
ornaments and so think in terms of
triangles<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> different<00:02:22.590> triangular

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
triangles and different triangular

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
triangles and different triangular
points<00:02:23.790> around<00:02:23.939> your<00:02:24.480> tree<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.290> nothing's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
points around your tree so nothing's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.100 
points around your tree so nothing's
ever<00:02:25.829> on<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.159> same<00:02:26.400> level<00:02:26.670> nothing's<00:02:27.659> ever<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
ever on the same level nothing's ever in

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
ever on the same level nothing's ever in
a<00:02:28.200> straight<00:02:28.500> line<00:02:28.799> it's<00:02:29.220> hard<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.549> when<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
a straight line it's hard to do when you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.089 
a straight line it's hard to do when you
don't<00:02:30.000> revolve<00:02:30.299> your<00:02:30.510> tree<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
don't revolve your tree it is but that

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.170 
don't revolve your tree it is but that
makes<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.519> very<00:02:32.670> simple<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.299> easy<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
makes it very simple and easy to do of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.330 
makes it very simple and easy to do of
course<00:02:36.390> burlap<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.140> still<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:37.859> big<00:02:38.099> this

as colors and patterns so I have a
question<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:55.709> you've<00:02:55.859> got<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> good<00:02:56.519> size<00:02:56.819> tree

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
question if you've got a good size tree

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.300 
question if you've got a good size tree
I<00:02:57.569> also<00:02:58.049> always<00:02:58.530> struggle<00:02:58.889> with<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.129> how

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310

much to buy so I'm not running back a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.539 
much to buy so I'm not running back a
million<00:03:01.109> times<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.709> make<00:03:01.859> sure<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.310> get

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
million times to make sure I really get

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.349 
million times to make sure I really get
a<00:03:02.579> good<00:03:02.790> coverage<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.959> bigger<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.709> better

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359

a good coverage the bigger the better
for<00:03:06.659> your<00:03:06.900> coverage<00:03:07.349> if<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.370> really<00:03:09.239> pay

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
for your coverage if you really pay

attention here I don't have that many
pieces<00:03:11.819> on<00:03:12.299> my<00:03:12.599> tree<00:03:12.959> if<00:03:13.409> I<00:03:13.620> buy<00:03:13.829> little<00:03:14.069> bitty

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
pieces on my tree if I buy little bitty

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.759 
pieces on my tree if I buy little bitty
ornaments<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.209> little<00:03:15.540> bitty<00:03:15.690> decorations<00:03:16.470> I

and so the larger things show and you

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.349 
and so the larger things show and you
can<00:03:22.829> do<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.129> whole<00:03:23.310> tree<00:03:23.609> in<00:03:23.730> 30<00:03:24.000> minutes

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
can do this whole tree in 30 minutes

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.180 
can do this whole tree in 30 minutes
when<00:03:24.540> you're<00:03:24.660> using<00:03:24.810> larger<00:03:25.319> objects<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.069> how

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
when you're using larger objects so how

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.530 
when you're using larger objects so how
many<00:03:26.340> bowls<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:29.760> spool<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
many bowls of this there is one spool of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.240 
many bowls of this there is one spool of
the<00:03:31.049> mash<00:03:32.030> right<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.569> haven't<00:03:33.930> used<00:03:34.379> but

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
the mash right and I haven't used but

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.849 
the mash right and I haven't used but
two<00:03:35.639> rolls<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.359> each<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.049> three<00:03:37.530> ribbons

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
then I've used the other design which
