00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.870 
the things you're gonna need very little
using<00:01:49.960> two<00:01:50.960> cups<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.500> ice<00:01:51.859> and<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.429> just<00:01:52.670> crush

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
using two cups of ice and I just crush

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.669 
using two cups of ice and I just crush
it<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.390> blends<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.780> little<00:01:53.869> bit<00:01:54.079> easier<00:01:54.439> and

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
it so it blends a little bit easier and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.620 
it so it blends a little bit easier and
then<00:01:54.829> we're<00:01:55.009> also<00:01:55.159> using<00:01:55.759> two<00:01:55.969> cups<00:01:56.209> of<00:01:56.390> kale

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.510 
then we're also using two cups of kale
