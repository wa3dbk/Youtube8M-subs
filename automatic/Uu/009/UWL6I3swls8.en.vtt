00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.720
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.210
 occasion I'm a video about how 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.150
 Rooting your Samsung Galaxy is advanced 7 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.610
 and 9 1070 good for this to do this 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.150
 routing process we have to have 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.380
 certain requirements one of them is to have 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.930
 exactly the model gt and 9.070 since 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.029
 If you do not have this model, we are not going to 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.960
 to be able to do this process well you do not 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.730
 you are going to know I have the gti 9.070 that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.410
 you can realize what they can 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.810
 corroborate and in the configuration is 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.590
 about the device and there's number 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.450
 of phone 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.810
 the next thing is to have updated your 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.910
 device in 4.1 for all if you do not 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.640
 You have what you can see in the link I'm going 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.340
 to leave so you can see how to update your 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.110
 samsung galaxy you are more good without more 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.960
 Preamble the next thing you should do 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.880
 is to download the root file that I'm going 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.280
 to leave distinction of this video a 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.590
 link to download there and then 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.770
 what copy is the king of the sd so 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 well let's continue the next thing 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.299
 we must do is 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.299
 turn off the device with a key 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.299
 observe 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 the health sector 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.440
 and ready is already paid now good we go 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.260
 to have to enter the recovery mode 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.220
 to be able to root our device and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.070
 what are we going to do with the combinations 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.170
 of keys that is volume plus key 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.170
 home and power key 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.930
 we are going to press without releasing the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 we wait until then with men 4 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.130
 Samsung then we can drop 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.950
 we have already entered our recovery by 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.649
 default let's go to the third 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.420
 option that says to view from external 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.420
 storage to see 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.870
 and good to go down we're going to do it with 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.610
 the combined with the volume keys and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.910
 let's select with the key 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.610
 On, let's go down to where I said 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.190
 the third broad option to promise not 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.080
 storage and select with the key 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.770
 on and good here we are already 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.050
 navigating in our in our memory 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.730
 external here then good I said 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 clearly that they left it at the root of 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.730
 the sd do not put it in any other 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.700
 folder because if it's not going to be very 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.290
 complicated to find it and neither 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.420
 they decompress the file only me 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.170
 what so and well there I have it I have the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.370
 dot robot 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.750

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 process 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 ready already broke our device 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.470
 what we have to do is follow us to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 the first option that appears in two 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.520
 little dots and a slam we give with power 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.410

 option that says robots and this new with 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.640
 the technical thing of power we give 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:25.110

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.110

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.500
 move around looking for and we're going to 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.790
 find an application that is called 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.180
