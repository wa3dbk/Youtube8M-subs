00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.220
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.470
 bowman name mark artur I'll show you how to build a website yet 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.469
 this month 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.259
 using only 5 blocks notes of windows 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.390
 from the notes block 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.730
 it's possible 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.130
 build any website you want 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.910
 logically there are more appropriate tools for this as a colony 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.130
 from dreamweaver 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.609
 and others available on the internet but from the blog that new we can not 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.010
 build any website we want 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.600
 just to know 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.130
 the commands in html 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.990
 good then this here basic structure of any site 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.750
 in html 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.900
 usually who html 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.390
 everything has a beginning 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 I have an end 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.050
 the beginning of an html website that is defined by tech html 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.220
 and it ends with this tag too 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.770
 the difference from tv 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.410
 silver finish and should be donor 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.120
 It's just this little bar here. 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.920
 sambar indie here 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.910
 this one at the end of the block 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.560
 which was initiated from satellite 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.970
 so we have the beginning 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 and we have the end 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
 end differentiated beginning only by this shithead 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.060
 the jewel 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.299
 so our block starts with html and ends with html 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.979
 inside of the first league we have other blocks 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.980
 which is the header 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.950
 that starts with this tag 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.380
 and ends with this tag 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.510
 and we have with the body block on our site 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.690
 that will contain all that image in the minds figures all that 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.700
 if we have available there on the sites as the price 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.320
 inside the header 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.679
 we have october crazy 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.210
 I go with the title of our site 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 Okay then just for example stay 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 let's detail 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 in any text 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.180
 this text that will not be displayed in the body of the site will have its own 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 to solve them 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.510
 and inside the body 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.739
 all that 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.790
 will be seen on the actual body page of the site 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.139
 beauty mafra-sc any that this for us to have a basic notion of that which 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.059
 will happen 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.289
 how then do you memorize this basic structure 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.859
 inside the body you will dictate everything that should appear on the site 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.399
 and in the header there are other functions 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.469
 one of the simplest is the function of the title 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.149
 that will determine your site's multiplus 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.949
 good done, here we go on file 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.809
 save as 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.859
 hear the thump on the work area 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.749
 with the name 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.929
 site 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.339
 on account of pm 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.879
 extension is very important to note the html site may be saved or with the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.499
 html extension 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.879
 little html session 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.359
 I'm already accustomed under the pm section 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.229
 I'll leave that shaikh was found time 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:14.219
 here in this field the question now how type you select option 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.209
 all files 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.029
 'so beauty done that, we just have to save our site 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.790
 he will be saved here 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.079
 in our to work 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.649
 on the site was created 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.419
 just give two clicks 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.619
 and our site is ready 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.359
 beauty the boson 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.899
 That's why you fucking piss the screen off the block just so we can understand what 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.639
 It happened 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.880
 in title we define my html site 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.150
 it will appear in this field here 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.539
 in that field etc. keiko yesterday the title of your site 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.519
 as well as the one I read 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.519
 was by the little window where it is there in the menu bar to start 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.469
 here at the publisher occupy this bar while editing the video 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.709
 but on the big screen 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.849
 the common computer this here you go 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.979
 you can also view the title of your site here below in the start menu 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.079
 inside the body we define this phase 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.789
 this text 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.769
 that it will actually appear 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.299
 in the body of your site 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.779
 good this is the very basic basic website 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.069
 is our first video lesson and in the next video-lessons 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:28.779
 we will be delving deeper into this wonderful html language 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.849
 so a hug to everyone and see you later
