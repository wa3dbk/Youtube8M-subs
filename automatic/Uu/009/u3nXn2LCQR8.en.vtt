00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.509
 today I will practically show you how 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 capture and popular 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.270
 be careful, though, that I don't talk about anything 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.580
 legendary spiders asylums you can 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.039
 find as unique as ever the three 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 animating monkeys best find us in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.980
 don't let this forest burn us like a cauldron 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 finding the case is better I don't know that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.160

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 pony much then I speak about something 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.000
 never after if time for I do symbiosis 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 there I recommend you take the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.189
 take them, that is, you must sell them 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 many because you arrive before you find 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 with you I wish it takes a while 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.729
 time because you are as finger as you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.869

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.040

 there were no wards a year later 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.100
 the nardò already give you some indication 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.280
 then you have to use repellent for 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.430
 walk around a lot of it until 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.330
 you will not see Terna move around the room 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 a rare and for the most part common 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.860
 sometimes it will be udine but for 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.050
 game you would see was moving 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.570

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.900

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:22.620
