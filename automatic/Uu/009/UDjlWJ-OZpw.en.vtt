it's round right now we're going to

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.600 
it's round right now we're going to
square<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.750> off<00:02:11.680> once<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.890> starts<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.400> dry

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
square that off once that starts to dry

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.770 
square that off once that starts to dry
up<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> come<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.630> we're

anything else the epoxy or some
materials<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.740> prevent<00:03:26.580> water

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
materials in this that prevent water

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.550 
materials in this that prevent water
intrusion<00:03:27.090> into<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.750> also<00:03:27.959> cover

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
intrusion into it it can also cover

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.110 
intrusion into it it can also cover
causing<00:03:29.010> surface<00:03:29.310> tension<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.670> epoxy<00:03:30.090> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
causing surface tension the epoxy to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.720 
causing surface tension the epoxy to
break<00:03:30.770> yeah<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.010> such<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> thing<00:03:32.280> as<00:03:32.550> too

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
break yeah is there such a thing as too

yeah<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:37.850> right<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.600> what<00:03:40.290> we're<00:03:40.380> going

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
yeah you just right so what we're going

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.449 
yeah you just right so what we're going
to<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.650> now<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.890> we're<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.160> mix<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
to do now is we're going to mix the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.790 
to do now is we're going to mix the
epoxy<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.480> container<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.260> top<00:03:43.530> coat

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
epoxy in this container for the top coat

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.400 
epoxy in this container for the top coat
and<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.270> metal<00:03:45.360> illusion<00:03:45.930> epoxy

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
and because it's a metal illusion epoxy

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.550 
and because it's a metal illusion epoxy
we're<00:03:46.920> going<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.250> mix<00:03:47.430> in<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:48.330> metal<00:03:49.200> effect

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
we're going to mix in the metal effect

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.150 
we're going to mix in the metal effect
product<00:03:50.190> which<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.989> white<00:03:51.989> powder<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
product which is a white powder and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.270 
product which is a white powder and
we're<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.300> mix<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.959> color<00:03:55.950> which

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
we're going to mix in the color which

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.680 
we're going to mix in the color which
today<00:03:56.580> we're<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.910> go<00:03:57.000> with<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> stainless

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
today we're going to go with a stainless

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
brush but this is a notched squeegee so

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.710 
brush but this is a notched squeegee so
it<00:04:41.040> makes<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.370> really<00:04:41.520> easy<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.820> get<00:04:42.660> the
