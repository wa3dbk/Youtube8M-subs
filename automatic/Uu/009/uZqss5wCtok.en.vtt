00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.410
 Suddenly on a sixth day 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.190
 Tour to choose a present 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.830
 Looking in Chubu 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.069
 I want to feel something wrong 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.699
 Why 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.270
 I wonder why 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.980
 I saw and thought several times 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.730
 The world of our characters and 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.439
 It is also directed to a tight call 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.439
 It is necessary not to have any change 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.149
 I made another title call 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.299
 It's not a title than when it's almost frozen 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.740
 Seougawa completely saturated with rocks 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 I wondered what I thought was wrong 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.420
 The garden is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.270
 While being greatly influenced by an overseas drama that the author likes 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.500
 Islon 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.480
 Moba 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.820
 I can not wait for the author's overseas drama 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.400
 Stop making the title we ignored the world view 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.330
 I want to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.330
 Tone 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.120
 lost 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.710
 Leader 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.810
 I was saying monotonous things now 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 71 there 5 days 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.550
 Money 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 Have a day 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.180
 Proposal 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.540
 In the Kansai area 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 Smiling 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.050
 Siena 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.200
 I understood 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.120
 Nakadai dialogue 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 The big brothers and so on 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 Let's follow this rule 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 That's good 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.679
 Such 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.989
 To that 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.559
 It was 8 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.419
 Leading into ptop5 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.669
 First ball 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.319
 Even though I have a functional resin business, I continued to use last time 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.499
 Because I completely forgot that 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.499
 Let's end the setting that the law is doing 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.529
 that is 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.959
 Then 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.209
 Consent 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.309
 Be beaten 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:08.859
 Western countries still have management functions 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:09.780
 It's sea
