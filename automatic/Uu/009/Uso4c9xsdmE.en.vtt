 We will explain the mechanism called the account that will be introduced for the first time by saying that it will float together . 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:25.450
 I would like 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.289
 In order to use the wii u first'll need to create a user account 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.419
 There is 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:38.829
 Although game consoles are often shared by multiple people at home, 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:44.600
 User account is created for every 9 wiiu players 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:50.210
 We call user account wii u the user 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:55.629

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 Play history is also recorded for each user 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:39.400
 The only difference is that when you start wui, you choose and use your own people 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.400
 As a result you can enjoy without affecting such as to save the data of other users 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 Nintendo eShop and Meverse 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:54.970

 You can use it per Nintendo network id unit 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:19.380
 In the future, this Nintendo Network id is not only called Wii but will be released by Nintendo in the future 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:25.440
 Will continue to use various hardware 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:28.490
 Also Nintendo Network id is from devices other than Nintendo's game devices 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.820
 We also plan to use 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.110

 Many of the main functions using the network with wii u will be distributed from the day of release date 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:04:02.240
 It will be available by updating the unit with network update 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:08.990
 The capacity of the program and data to be updated has become quite large, so at home 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:11.390
 Depending on the speed of the line and the degree of congestion , it will take some time 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:17.120
 I think 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:22.940
 It is a game console that demonstrates its worth by connecting to the Internet in winter 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:28.240
 Network Update adds more features so bother with your hands 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.240
