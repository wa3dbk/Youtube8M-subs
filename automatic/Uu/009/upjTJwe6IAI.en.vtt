 The small and brave 

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:32.871
 locomotive slowly began to drag 

00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:38.578

 Everything, everyone 

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:58.375

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.743

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:32.852
 Until at last they reached the top of the mountain 

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:38.514
 and they went down to the city very happy where they celebrated all 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.645
 together and celebrated together with the children of the city. 

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:44.975
 The locomotive 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.182
 After so much effort and work 

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:58.972
