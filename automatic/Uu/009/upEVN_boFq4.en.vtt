from<00:00:09.870> good<00:00:10.110> sir<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
from good sir first that was in the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
from good sir first that was in the
first<00:00:11.759> game<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.090> actually<00:00:12.300> played<00:00:12.690> pretty

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
first game that I actually played pretty

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.070 
first game that I actually played pretty
happy<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.009> shot<00:00:14.280> but<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> didn't<00:00:15.809> record

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
happy with that shot but I didn't record

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840 
happy with that shot but I didn't record
any<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> recorded

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
any of this because it's like I recorded

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
any of this because it's like I recorded
I<00:00:18.029> guess<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:18.449> actual<00:00:18.779> gameplay<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.170> it's

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
I guess an actual gameplay because it's

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.779 
I guess an actual gameplay because it's
against<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> computer<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.640> going

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
against the computer so it's all going

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.189 
against the computer so it's all going
to<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.939> instant<00:00:21.359> replay<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.050> seems

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to be instant replay it just seems

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109 
to be instant replay it just seems
easier<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.830> me<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> way<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.939> find

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
easier for me that way I can just find

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.429
