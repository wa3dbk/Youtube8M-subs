five dollar dress that I found scrunched

five dollar dress that I found scrunched
up<00:03:09.849> on<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.060> floor<00:03:10.269> in<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.420> flea<00:03:10.569> market<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
up on the floor in a flea market and the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.780 
up on the floor in a flea market and the
fabric<00:03:11.920> was<00:03:12.010> horrible<00:03:12.370> there<00:03:12.549> was<00:03:12.640> just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
fabric was horrible there was just

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.890 
fabric was horrible there was just
something<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.180> shape<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
something in the shape of it that I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.839 
something in the shape of it that I
thought<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.410> could<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.620> better<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.310> so

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
thought this could be better and so

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.150 
thought this could be better and so
suddenly<00:03:16.209> I've<00:03:16.780> rebuilt<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.500> into<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:17.890> new

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
suddenly I've rebuilt it into this new

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.000 
suddenly I've rebuilt it into this new
style<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.230> lot<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.500> complaints<00:03:20.799> about

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
style so a lot of the complaints about

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.199 
style so a lot of the complaints about
vintage<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.579> fact<00:03:21.760> people<00:03:21.910> don't<00:03:22.120> like

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
vintage of the fact people don't like

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.430 
vintage of the fact people don't like
the<00:03:22.299> fabrics<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:22.989> there's<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.290> lot<00:03:23.410> of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
the fabrics because there's a lot of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.599 
the fabrics because there's a lot of
polyester<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> other<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.489> that

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
polyester and the other one is that

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.490 
polyester and the other one is that
people<00:03:24.670> can't<00:03:25.030> find<00:03:25.239> sizes<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.350> like

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
people can't find sizes that they like

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800 
people can't find sizes that they like
so<00:03:26.859> my<00:03:27.130> whole<00:03:27.340> ethos<00:03:27.700> was<00:03:27.850> bob<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.299> I'll<00:03:28.630> take

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
so my whole ethos was bob is I'll take

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.330 
so my whole ethos was bob is I'll take
those<00:03:28.959> classic<00:03:29.319> styles<00:03:29.680> make<00:03:29.859> them<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.069> lovely

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
those classic styles make them in lovely

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.610 
those classic styles make them in lovely
fabrics<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.180> all<00:03:31.299> sizes<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.590> a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
fabrics and in all sizes and so just a

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.009 
fabrics and in all sizes and so just a
kind<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.829> opens<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.850> style<00:03:34.209> yeah<00:03:34.750> well

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
kind of opens up that style yeah well

kind of opens up that style yeah well
and<00:03:35.920> also<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.730> just<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.750> think<00:03:38.170> because<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.530> my

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
and also I just I think because of my

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.110 
and also I just I think because of my
upbringing<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.640> fact<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:39.880> I<00:03:40.000> was

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
upbringing of the fact that I was

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.789 
upbringing of the fact that I was
brought<00:03:40.269> up<00:03:40.420> by<00:03:40.450> people<00:03:40.720> who<00:03:40.930> make<00:03:41.109> clothes<00:03:41.410> I

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
brought up by people who make clothes I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
just I couldn't resist not doing my own

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.699 
just I couldn't resist not doing my own
stuff<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:04.569> what's<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.959> look<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> label<00:04:05.650> I

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
stuff and what's the look of the label I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.170 
stuff and what's the look of the label I
mean<00:04:05.859> it<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.310> very<00:04:06.549> distinctive

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
mean it because it is very distinctive

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.809 
mean it because it is very distinctive
and<00:04:07.389> it<00:04:07.450> also<00:04:07.600> feels<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.380> it's<00:04:09.010> speaking<00:04:09.579> to

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
and it also feels like it's speaking to

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.059 
and it also feels like it's speaking to
a<00:04:10.239> kind<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.170> customer<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.620> maybe<00:04:11.889> isn't

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
a kind of customer that maybe isn't

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.400 
a kind of customer that maybe isn't
catered<00:04:12.519> for<00:04:12.730> in<00:04:13.030> other<00:04:13.239> places<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:14.019> think<00:04:14.260> that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
catered for in other places I think that

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.569 
catered for in other places I think that
well<00:04:14.620> how<00:04:14.769> would<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:14.920> describe<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.340> look<00:04:15.459> at

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
well how would I describe the look at

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.400 
well how would I describe the look at
the<00:04:15.670> label<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:16.570> obviously<00:04:17.049> vintage

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
the label like it's obviously vintage

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.110 
the label like it's obviously vintage
inspired<00:04:17.620> but<00:04:18.039> a<00:04:18.100> lot<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.370> people<00:04:18.639> do<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.940> and

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
inspired but a lot of people do that and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.340 
inspired but a lot of people do that and
I<00:04:19.150> think<00:04:19.299> what's<00:04:19.450> different<00:04:19.600> about<00:04:19.780> Bob<00:04:20.169> is

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
I think what's different about Bob is

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.170 
I think what's different about Bob is
that<00:04:20.500> I've<00:04:20.590> tried<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.370> mix<00:04:21.519> in<00:04:21.729> enough

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
that I've tried to mix in enough

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.060 
that I've tried to mix in enough
modern<00:04:22.479> vibes<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.259> that<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.650> doesn't<00:04:23.979> feel

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
modern vibes so that it doesn't feel

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.550 
modern vibes so that it doesn't feel
like<00:04:24.130> you're<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.460> fancy<00:04:24.789> dress<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.440> know

just kind of just not dress up and what

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.060 
just kind of just not dress up and what
about<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:01.389> future<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.870> know<00:05:02.080> for<00:05:02.530> vintage<00:05:02.710> do

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
about the future you know for vintage do

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.460 
about the future you know for vintage do
you<00:05:03.130> think<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.430> it's<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:04.479> trend<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.229> will

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
you think that it's a trend that will

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.249 
you think that it's a trend that will
continue<00:05:05.889> well<00:05:06.669> I<00:05:06.699> think<00:05:07.020> what<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.110> realize

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
continue well I think what you realize

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.540 
continue well I think what you realize
is<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.650> most<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:09.099> the<00:05:09.160> high<00:05:09.280> street<00:05:09.430> is

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
is that most of the high street is

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.040 
is that most of the high street is
inspired<00:05:09.910> by<00:05:10.030> something<00:05:10.599> that's<00:05:10.780> happened

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
inspired by something that's happened

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.640 
inspired by something that's happened
before<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:11.949> vintage<00:05:12.910> is<00:05:13.030> everywhere<00:05:13.479> but<00:05:14.229> it's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
before so vintage is everywhere but it's

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.070 
before so vintage is everywhere but it's
just<00:05:14.919> kind<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.400> fun<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.610> have<00:05:15.880> an<00:05:15.970> original<00:05:16.150> so

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
just kind of fun to have an original so

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.540 
just kind of fun to have an original so
I<00:05:17.110> think<00:05:17.259> people<00:05:17.590> starting<00:05:18.099> to<00:05:18.190> realize<00:05:18.520> that

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
I think people starting to realize that

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.400 
I think people starting to realize that
the<00:05:18.820> originals<00:05:19.300> are<00:05:19.570> more<00:05:19.840> unique<00:05:20.110> and

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
the originals are more unique and

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.320 
the originals are more unique and
probably<00:05:21.039> really<00:05:21.280> well<00:05:21.400> made<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.940> it's

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
probably really well made and it's

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.820 
probably really well made and it's
really<00:05:22.509> nice<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.690> walk<00:05:23.139> into<00:05:23.289> a<00:05:23.410> room<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.650> say

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
really nice to walk into a room and say

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.589 
really nice to walk into a room and say
no<00:05:24.099> one<00:05:24.220> else<00:05:24.250> got<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:24.639> dress<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.539> think

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
no one else got this dress and I think

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.149 
no one else got this dress and I think
that's<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.080> trend<00:05:26.320> that's<00:05:26.740> what<00:05:26.889> people<00:05:27.039> are

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
that's the trend that's what people are

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.310 
that's the trend that's what people are
finding<00:05:27.340> exciting<00:05:27.820> but<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> think<00:05:28.479> I<00:05:28.870> think

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
finding exciting but so I think I think

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.589 
finding exciting but so I think I think
it's<00:05:29.440> around<00:05:29.740> capes<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.150> coast<00:05:31.389> gonna

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
it's around capes and the coast gonna

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.790 
it's around capes and the coast gonna
get<00:05:31.720> older<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.110> older<00:05:32.199> and<00:05:32.409> older<00:05:32.500> which<00:05:32.770> is

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
get older and older and older which is

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.789 
get older and older and older which is
gonna<00:05:33.130> make<00:05:33.250> it<00:05:33.400> even<00:05:33.490> more<00:05:33.669> special
