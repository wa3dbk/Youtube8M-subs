00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.880
 collection on gamecube games 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.880
 gamecube 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.090
 we have it all by counting both 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.320
 have all good that both 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.550
 weeks to all happy all while 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.500
 counting both franchises have 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.419
 counting dads good when you're not 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.790
 keep at 199 euros 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.899
 and today I feel we are going to talk 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.269
 it's gamecube 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.550
 here I am because I have a career 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.379
 holy agathe 47 and me there is one 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.600
 little bit a little bit less 47 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.129
 so we start in quebec so 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.930
 so we start the gac metroid prime in 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.100
 very good condition 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.420
 the charm is a pregnancy in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 urban grass in France 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.200
 2 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:14.640
 so mario this match tennis gym gym to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.490
 okinawa apparently it's like a little 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.020
 bin like that we have the game and then once 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.670
 troy of changes he is where he is 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 not obvious but good in synod on 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 starfox adventures to a starfox a game 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.220
 so I summarize this formula it's a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 zelda 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 the game is very beautiful teeth but if we 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 compare to that of ait the zelda to 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 compare that to me I do not compare me 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 I say according then the feasts 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 cyril za have signed in time there are 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.210
 steps there is all this it is not bad yes 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.740
 after that to fill again we go glen 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.800
 how how can we track 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.899
 but jim henson 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.369
 but I 'm good at playing it's 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 interesting in this game is that at the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.560
 end of the game you have a zelda to gbagbo 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.140

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 shit and the cloudy yoke at several 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 it's better it's more fun it's for sure 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.539
 like that you can not pass your neighbor to 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.229
 side when we are rich we did 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.229
