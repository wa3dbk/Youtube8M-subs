00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.889
 hello everybody in this video here we go 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.390
 show you how to recharge 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:22.189
 of the original hp cards 46 15 46 24 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.060
 6 25 she 55 25 and some models 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.430
 similar things, it had six cartridges that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.550
 in the case of this model up to 670 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.690
 but there is also that 56 4 920 all 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.460
 recharge process the same model as the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.130
 uses cartridges that I have the chip 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.810
 original is not need to have chip fu 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.900
 the chip that you originally used 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.670
 machine even if the original cartridge that 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.710
 when I asked them for capture 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.390
 feeling cartridges and you can send it okay 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.010
 she continues to print only thing that 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.930
 have to have tried the cartridge 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.240
 then as you're refilling works 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.440
 printing there in the printer and 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.840
 suddenly began to fail to print 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.790
 You'll take what's for the impression. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.650
 remove the original cartridge or 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 loaded in the case of small load 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.820
 Original, no problem, and it's going to get 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.759
 red to recharge 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.610
 no need to drill a hole in the cartridge 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.620
 will use the paint we work here 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.470
 to try black and colorful pepper 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.850
 dye and also has the photographic black 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.550
 some models that use five 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 cartridges always use the paint run 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.790
 This is how it comes in the in hp printers 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 line will live claims that carlos hill 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.979
 will get a needle syringe and will pull 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.350
 ink in the case of the hot river is not pull 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.380
 another 15 ml per one wants to check 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.390
 original it empty it supports more or 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.070
 minus 56 ink average 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.600
 So here he has a little bit of 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.049
 then you will always recharge 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.670
 plus 36 with the syringe they are 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.930
 needle will not insert needles inside 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.610
 this sponge you will put 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.750
 that is and is squeezing the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.750
 cylinder with care 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:19.569
 I filled three months what if a 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.360
 Little ink squeezed and went wrong 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.130
 no problem just cleaning the cartridge one 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.140
 little water 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.850
 he stays here is a little paint and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.040
 started dribbling down 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 No problem, that's the way it gets 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 with a toilet paper in case it is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.340
 with water or alcohol 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 This is going to do the cleaning here. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.040
 The promise that I breathe is anyway 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
 that works 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 will get dirty here will only personnel with 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.120
 practice this will put less ink 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.070
 will realize that it will fill not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.580
 need no other material 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.290
 to do the recharge is just that and that 's it 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.510
 let it leak a little bit 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 because it is the excess paint that has the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.570
 sponge so much that between five and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 six months 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.739
 the sponge that is this size as soon as 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.720
 supports here as he already had a little 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.420
 of ink filled more 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.030
 Check it out, it 's okay. 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.040
 it will not leak into the printer 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.700
 I 'm full guard here a little let 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.350
 here o 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.600
 put some with the download pgm 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 he does a little bit of paint just to 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.130
 Stabilize does the same process in the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.440
 eight cartridges of black the price of car 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:30.160
 a little more paint will put there 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:35.860
 some 7 8 ml is not very absorbed 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.500
 there when it comes to filling you want 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.070
 do not observer that everything is already 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.070
 loaded 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.959
 so if you want to be always putting 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:04:01.390
 low ink and 236 limits only from low 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:04:09.910
 the problem took a little more 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:13.049
 a little bit a little bit 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.049
 and that's the way it 's expensive 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:23.290
 I put a little up here only for 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:31.510
 invasion and will stabilize in the same 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:42.310
 bakery obtained in their genetical skin in a 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:44.919
 FalcÃ³n little water on're ready 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.900
 recharge take care and chip at night in 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.880
 file he has something here 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.389
 This will insert and back into a 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.010
 All right printer that will pay 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:00.150
 back makes the recharging process 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:03.850
 while the cartridges in the 418 therefore 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.560
 after reloading with an agenda in case 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.419
 he did not check that it was all in color 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.370
 magenta than red 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.960
 this is the case of the recharge you took out 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.950
 the cartridge filled enough had then 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.520
 procedures make the head of 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.190
 print 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.669
 You come here is a tool for 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.860
 low 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.630
 Tools Clean the Print Head 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.340
 and makes one two three beauty by 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.550
 normalize and exit all things 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.550
 certinhas 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.240
 if it is clogged if after a few 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.669
 cleanings 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.370
 if the impression does not work 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.700
 Stupid head promise but if I 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.380
 there were still the colors here 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.960
 some things appear made me see him 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.780
 staying here is not what I paint that is fine 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.039
 complicated we use this correct paint 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.350
 We work with the black ink. 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.979
 segment and color when you do not have 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.610
 problem 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.330
 GIC is already a difference either 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.250
 they will think 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.320
 everything went wrong but it 's not just 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.450
 do a cleaning it will work 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.370
 checks the print quality on the 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.450
 page piece if the quality is 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.669
 unsatisfactory attempts to clean normally 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.830
 second level here this cleaning is a 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.210
 little deeper she'll pull ink 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.000
 for printer 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.889
 so that's what the agent has 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.249
 used 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.349
 I think this piece here, if you do not 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.960
 purchased with the kit and we recommend 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.389
 put that piece that will take care of that 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.430
 behind comes from inside the printer, right? 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.770
 so he came to check out other videos of ours. 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.659
 alloy teaches how installed it thinks 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.969
 with that noise is doing here looks 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.310
 It's throwing ink from the cartridge and it's 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.469
 throwing a sponge inside the machine 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.939
 This is going to throw everything out then. 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.770
 you will always have a clean printer 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:51.180
 in this sense of the cleaning kit after 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.490
 the other cleaning 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.039
 it came out first if you did not like it 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.349
 if and if this company is not 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:01.500
 so have to leave print 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:05.520
 the quality is ok you can give 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.659
 cancel x she will redo the 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.039
 union functions 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:13.039
