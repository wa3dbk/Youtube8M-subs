00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.580
 how to maintain the proportions of a body 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 human 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 To begin with, you have to separate the body 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.070
 human into eight equal parts head 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.220
 represents a part therefore it is necessary to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.539
 draw a vertical line and make eight 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.539
 equal segments 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.830
 we must first draw the head 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:49.489
 the neck is a quarter of the head and the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.489
 shoulders are two heads wide 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.250
 the bust represents two parts and the basin 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.250
 a part 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.750
 the legs occupy four parts at 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:33.159
 first part is separated from the second 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:35.140
 knees and the second part ends 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.009
 at the ankles giving rise to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.009
 To the feet 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.720
 now you have to draw the arms 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.970
 the first part ends by the elbow is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.970
 the second by the pulse 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:54.990
 so the head makes a session the body and the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.990
 chest take two sessions 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.000
 the other bowl 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:18.480
 the thighs two sessions and on the knees 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 of exceptions
