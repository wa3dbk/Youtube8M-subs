00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
the face of this cube to the right and I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.140 
the face of this cube to the right and I
want<00:00:51.229> to<00:00:51.320> match<00:00:51.470> that<00:00:51.500> face<00:00:52.129> up<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:52.790> face

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
want to match that face up to this face

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.270 
want to match that face up to this face
on<00:00:53.510> my<00:00:54.049> cube<00:00:55.239> it<00:00:56.239> will<00:00:56.510> rotate<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.439> Q<00:00:57.860> so<00:00:58.129> that

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
on my cube it will rotate this Q so that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.990 
on my cube it will rotate this Q so that
they're<00:00:58.430> flush<00:00:58.790> against<00:00:59.210> each<00:00:59.330> other<00:00:59.510> like<00:01:00.470> so
