so<00:00:00.960> now<00:00:01.050> moving<00:00:01.319> on<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.740> reverse<00:00:02.990> silk<00:00:03.990> really

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
so now moving on to reverse silk really

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.560 
so now moving on to reverse silk really
reverse<00:00:05.850> silk<00:00:06.150> reeling<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.830> much<00:00:07.830> similar<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
reverse silk reeling is much similar to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.740 
reverse silk reeling is much similar to
to<00:00:09.570> forward<00:00:09.900> silk<00:00:10.110> reeling<00:00:10.820> except<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.059> done

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
to forward silk reeling except it's done

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.620 
to forward silk reeling except it's done
in<00:00:13.019> reverse<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:17.400> basic<00:00:17.789> idea<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
in reverse the the basic idea is the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.910 
in reverse the the basic idea is the
same<00:00:18.830> we're<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:21.029> making<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.420> circle

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
same we're going to be making a circle

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.230 
same we're going to be making a circle
with<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.949> arm<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.880> case<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.699> one

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
with the arm but in this case the as one

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
with the arm but in this case the as one
comes<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> top<00:00:28.279> ones<00:00:29.279> leading<00:00:29.490> with

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
comes over the top ones leading with

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.100 
comes over the top ones leading with
pinky<00:00:31.579> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.210> underneath<00:00:35.930> energy<00:00:36.930> goes

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
pinky and then underneath energy goes

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.630 
pinky and then underneath energy goes
into<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.440> thumb

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.230 

exhale

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.420 

on<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.050> under<00:00:48.440> side<00:00:49.720> inhale<00:00:51.160> we're<00:00:52.160> coming

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
on the under side inhale we're coming

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:08.250 
on the under side inhale we're coming
over<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.180> circle

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:38.080 

again<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.130> eyes<00:01:09.310> follow<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.970> hand

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.029 

and<00:01:38.240> throughout<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.200> exercise<00:01:39.679> we're

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
and throughout this exercise we're

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.249 
and throughout this exercise we're
maintaining<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:41.149> figure-eight<00:01:41.869> motion<00:01:44.259> in

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
maintaining the figure-eight motion in

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:56.560 
maintaining the figure-eight motion in
the<00:01:45.500> feet

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.710 

and<00:01:57.050> as<00:01:57.470> mentioned<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:58.510> paradoxically<00:01:59.510> is

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
and as mentioned this paradoxically is

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.130 
and as mentioned this paradoxically is
creating<00:02:00.140> passageways<00:02:00.800> within<00:02:01.700> your<00:02:01.850> body<00:02:02.140> to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
creating passageways within your body to

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.130 
creating passageways within your body to
allow<00:02:03.409> eventually<00:02:04.400> allow<00:02:04.640> rapid<00:02:05.090> release<00:02:05.570> of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
allow eventually allow rapid release of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.430 
allow eventually allow rapid release of
power<00:02:06.410> or<00:02:06.770> faj<00:02:07.190> in
