a<00:01:48.119> button<00:01:48.470> Claude<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> jumping<00:01:49.950> into<00:01:50.070> our

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
a button Claude is jumping into our

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.749 
a button Claude is jumping into our
world<00:01:51.560> now<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.190> minute<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.670> were

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
world now in just one minute we were

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.400 
world now in just one minute we were
able<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.180> something<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.720> looks<00:01:54.750> great

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410

able to make something that looks great
now<00:01:56.070> let's<00:01:56.190> build<00:01:56.399> upon<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.240> create<00:01:57.660> a

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
now let's build upon that and create a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.170 
now let's build upon that and create a
simple<00:01:58.020> game<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.380> our<00:01:58.500> world<00:01:58.710> step<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.670> our

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
simple game in our world step one our

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
simple game in our world step one our
home<00:02:00.450> base<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:00.990> we'll<00:02:01.860> choose<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.220> village<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
home base so we'll choose this village I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.060 
home base so we'll choose this village I
can<00:02:03.600> place<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.899> anywhere<00:02:04.020> I'd<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.560> I'll

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.980 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll
put<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.670> this'll<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.479> our<00:02:06.509> town

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
put it right here this'll be our town

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.400 
put it right here this'll be our town
square<00:02:07.970> all<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.149> step<00:02:09.509> two<00:02:09.720> let's<00:02:09.899> add<00:02:10.170> some

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
square all right step two let's add some

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
square all right step two let's add some
behaviors<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.160> everything<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.820> projects

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
behaviors now everything in projects

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.420 
behaviors now everything in projects
part<00:02:12.570> has<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> brain<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.890> changed

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
part has a brain that can be changed

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.460 
part has a brain that can be changed
let's<00:02:15.030> bring<00:02:15.209> something<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.660> life<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.290> this

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
let's bring something to life take this

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.220 
let's bring something to life take this
rock<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:17.040> instance<00:02:17.400> its<00:02:18.209> brain's<00:02:18.510> empty<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
rock for instance its brain's empty and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.140 
rock for instance its brain's empty and
Claude<00:02:19.950> could<00:02:20.160> go<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.610> add<00:02:20.700> behaviors

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
Claude could go in and add behaviors

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.120 
Claude could go in and add behaviors
line<00:02:21.360> by<00:02:21.540> line<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:22.019> for<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.799> can<00:02:22.950> make

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
line by line but for now we can make

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.890 
line by line but for now we can make
this<00:02:23.250> rock<00:02:23.489> become<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> pet<00:02:24.269> with<00:02:24.480> something<00:02:24.810> we
