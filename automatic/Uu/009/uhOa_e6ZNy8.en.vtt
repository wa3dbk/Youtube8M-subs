 your questions I would select him 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.490
 as usual you know them the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.470
 too private questions I will not answer them 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.959
 not by cons I will tell you the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.210
 question not to ask since ben I have 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.390
 already made faq videos and and lo and behold 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.030
 it would be a little silly to rest 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.020
 same questions so I'm 32 here 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.800
 because it's the questions that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.390
 come back frequently 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.860
 so I answer questions that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.860
 come back most frequently so I have 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.540
 32 years old I live in Lyon my favorite club 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.580
 it's the madrid real 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.480
 my favorite player is karim benzema 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.930
 I play consoles since I have 10 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.120
 11 years what drove me to the envi 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.070
 videos my passion for games 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.450
 video and also the fact that I was watching 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.040
 many careers on the internet and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.280
 that ben voila I wanted to launch me 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280
 as well 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.750
 I work in a school 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.200
 here are the chickens and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.090
 this is especially yes recently I had some 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.769
 big health concerns 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.970
 do not ask any questions about it 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.239
 prefer it's one thing that I 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.769
 would prefer to forget 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.720
 so do not ask questions there 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.750
 it's useless because it's not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.370
 not important for the channel 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.700
 chickens cost and I hope you 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.379
