00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
note at a time ok so the way that it

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.240 
note at a time ok so the way that it
works<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.530> let<00:00:14.160> me<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.250> uh<00:00:14.549> closes<00:00:15.089> out

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
works is that let me just uh closes out

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
works is that let me just uh closes out
ok<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.730> that's<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.119> way<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
ok so that's the way that the way that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.750 
ok so that's the way that the way that
it<00:00:19.710> works<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.010> instead<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.400> playing<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it works is that instead of playing the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630 
it works is that instead of playing the
the<00:00:21.150> entire<00:00:21.420> board<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.960> doing<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.650> note<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.430> a

than<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:35.519> right<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.920> okay<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.310> here's

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
than this see right here okay so here's

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.530 
than this see right here okay so here's
a<00:02:38.670> C<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.170> here's<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.290> seat<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.120> same<00:02:42.359> way

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
a C and here's a seat in the same way

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.190 
a C and here's a seat in the same way
that<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.170> piano<00:02:43.560> here's<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.609> C<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.200> here's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that on the piano here's a C and here's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.819 
that on the piano here's a C and here's
see<00:02:46.700> all<00:02:47.700> right<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.639> come<00:02:50.639> on<00:02:50.819> finger<00:02:51.239> picking

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
see all right so come on finger picking

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.789 
see all right so come on finger picking
I'm<00:02:52.829> doing<00:02:53.549> is<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.989> keeping<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.380> cord

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
I'm doing is I'm just keeping the cord

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.770 
I'm doing is I'm just keeping the cord
but<00:02:56.400> instead<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:59.329> just<00:03:00.329> doing

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
but instead of going I'm just doing

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.229 
but instead of going I'm just doing
different<00:03:01.049> permutations<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.190> might<00:03:03.120> be

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
different permutations so I might be

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:12.760 
different permutations so I might be
going<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:03.630> this

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.520 

ok<00:03:13.770> now<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.180> finger-picking<00:03:15.660> pattern<00:03:15.840> there

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
ok now the finger-picking pattern there

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.860 
ok now the finger-picking pattern there
was<00:03:17.220> actually<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.640> y<00:03:18.320> 3<00:03:19.320> y<00:03:19.350> 3<00:03:19.830> notes<00:03:20.250> then

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
was actually a y 3 y 3 notes then

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.330 
was actually a y 3 y 3 notes then
because<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.320> three<00:03:22.590> notes<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.010> are<00:03:23.040> in

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
because the three notes that are in

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.520 
because the three notes that are in
accord<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:24.150> make<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> chord<00:03:24.750> major<00:03:24.990> or<00:03:25.290> minor

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
accord to make a chord major or minor

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.120 
accord to make a chord major or minor
are<00:03:25.920> always<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.940> route<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:28.020> third<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.740> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
are always the route the third and the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.840 
are always the route the third and the
fifth<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.000> will<00:03:30.180> never<00:03:30.480> ever<00:03:30.960> change<00:03:31.850> ok

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
fifth and that will never ever change ok

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.130 
fifth and that will never ever change ok
so<00:03:33.390> look<00:03:34.110> at<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.410> route<00:03:34.740> 35<00:03:35.570> do<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.600> mean<00:03:36.960> you

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
so look at this route 35 do I mean you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.250 
so look at this route 35 do I mean you
you<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.740> make<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.190> 4<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:38.700> 4<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.090> cord<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:40.110> then

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you to make it a 4 of 4 no cord but then

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.380 
you to make it a 4 of 4 no cord but then
you<00:03:40.410> start<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> change<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.310> content<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.240> this

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
you start to change the content of this

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.320 
you start to change the content of this
cord<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.470> make<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> 4<00:03:44.220> no<00:03:44.340> cord<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:45.180> would

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
cord if I make this a 4 no cord it would

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.440 
cord if I make this a 4 no cord it would
be<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.690> c<00:03:45.990> major<00:03:46.200> seven<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:47.310> something<00:03:47.580> you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
be like a c major seven or something you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.970 
be like a c major seven or something you
know<00:03:48.480> something<00:03:49.610> along<00:03:50.610> those<00:03:50.820> lines<00:03:50.880> now<00:03:51.980> why

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
know something along those lines now why

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.670 
know something along those lines now why
a<00:03:53.310> 30<00:03:53.700> cord<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:54.990> you<00:03:55.110> owe<00:03:55.140> issues

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
a 30 cord is because you owe issues

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.530 
a 30 cord is because you owe issues
unique<00:03:55.980> three<00:03:56.280> notes<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.730> make<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.180> cord

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
unique three notes to make that cord

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.650 
unique three notes to make that cord
okay<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.310> busted<00:03:59.790> three<00:04:00.150> notes<00:04:00.390> in

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
okay if you have busted three notes in

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.590 
okay if you have busted three notes in
accord<00:04:01.140> it's<00:04:01.920> like<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.610> power<00:04:03.000> cord<00:04:03.510> or

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
accord it's like a power cord or

have c e it doesn't tell me that this is
a<00:04:15.660> c-major<00:04:16.049> chord<00:04:16.230> either<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:17.460> could<00:04:17.670> be<00:04:17.820> an

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
a c-major chord either this could be an

a c-major chord either this could be an
a<00:04:18.210> minor<00:04:18.480> chord<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:19.109> all<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:19.290> know<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.770> this

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
a minor chord for all I know in this

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.880 
a minor chord for all I know in this
case<00:04:20.790> it's<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.359> minor<00:04:21.660> now<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.620> chord

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
case it's a minor now your chord

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.770 
case it's a minor now your chord
structure<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.920> 35<00:04:25.920> room<00:04:26.670> and<00:04:27.210> what<00:04:27.750> I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
structure here is 35 room and what I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.240 
structure here is 35 room and what I
mean<00:04:27.900> by<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.170> is<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.470> when<00:04:28.650> i<00:04:28.680> play<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
mean by that is that when i play on the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.700 
mean by that is that when i play on the
piano<00:04:29.840> right<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:31.400> okay<00:04:32.400> i'm<00:04:32.700> going<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.590> SI<00:04:34.590> e

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
piano right here okay i'm going a SI e

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.020 
piano right here okay i'm going a SI e
so<00:04:37.710> a's<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.610> root<00:04:39.050> ok<00:04:40.250> what's<00:04:41.250> up<00:04:41.370> here<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.790> is

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
so a's the root ok what's up here a is

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.200 
so a's the root ok what's up here a is
the<00:04:42.420> root<00:04:43.670> up<00:04:44.670> movin<00:04:45.300> higher<00:04:45.540> days<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.380> root

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
the root up movin higher days the root

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.260 
the root up movin higher days the root
sees<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.390> third<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.990> ease<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.770> fifth<00:04:50.270> okay

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
sees the third and ease the fifth okay

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.620 
sees the third and ease the fifth okay
so<00:04:51.660> that's<00:04:51.870> how<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.050> that's<00:04:52.590> members<00:04:52.980> ah<00:04:53.630> why

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
so that's how that that's members ah why

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.900 
so that's how that that's members ah why
can't<00:04:55.020> there<00:04:55.080> be<00:04:55.140> four<00:04:55.530> more<00:04:55.860> well<00:04:56.310> there<00:04:56.460> can

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
can't there be four more well there can

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.720 
can't there be four more well there can
be<00:04:56.940> i<00:04:57.150> mean<00:04:57.240> if<00:04:57.570> i<00:04:57.690> were<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:58.050> add<00:04:58.460> in<00:04:59.460> this

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
be i mean if i were to add in this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.360 
be i mean if i were to add in this
arpeggio<00:05:00.120> more<00:05:00.720> than<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.530> more<00:05:01.920> than<00:05:02.070> four

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
arpeggio more than for more than four
