 we are without gas 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 that we had to use is in the armchair 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.980

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.030
 program and others 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.869
 many things that I have here and good to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 see the helmets these are 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.729
 these are the helmets with which I comment 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.729
 OK 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 Well listen to fucking mother so I say 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.549
 has never been for 15 payment I think that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.439
 is the host this and well this is the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.299
 special part is that it is the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.700
 television now you know why not 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.010
 I can record live a TV 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.710
 lifelong drawer 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.500
 obviously does not have hdmi scale xbox 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.390
 pure logic 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.120
 all these are the drawers that I have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 basically full of shit 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.750
 and I have a few sides the truth 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 films 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.040
 here the only thing I have I think is the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.260
 hair and some some 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.640
 and good 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.950
 My little table where we eat hurts 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 I'm sorry I do not know why you left here the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.200
 jacket but fuck them 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.060
 ok and well this is typical 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 shelf that you have in your full house 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.840
 of books and then in your life you've made them 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.360
 read then this is one of those 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.730
 bookshelves here all the books that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.400
 there is not a little bit the truth 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.850
 street pasteur intellectual by the way a 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 Valencian 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.700
 valencia up here also here 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250
 I also have drawings one because I 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.410
 I have always drawn 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.860
 I do not know if you will see it but it is a baby in my 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.590
 sister indeed 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.950
 I have to teach that less than I have 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.950
 taught 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.660
 in the drawing 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.090
 here beige 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.220
 gollum is obviously goal 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 this what sees it very much the truth a 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.520
 Tiger 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.130
 how not 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.050
 and bob marley 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
 This is made of charcoal cost me 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.870
 quite the truth 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.870
 then 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.980
 the reference photo that I had 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.360
 one 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.920
 I 've always had Europe always 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.040
 he has done well 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 but the truth is that a few years ago this 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.210
 drawing already have two and a half years 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.610
 going up 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.340
 two 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.740
 basically going here movies the truth 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.260
 I do not have many 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.950
 and here, well, this is already good 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.480
 this when the tablecloth is not there 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 here in the middle and the truth that remains 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.340
 very well there I leave this a bar 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.010
 bar is true that we do not use it 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.350
 never but good looks good with the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.130
 bow this the truth to me this part of 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.680
 I love the house 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.870
 here good the truth that neither 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.350
 we tried and here I put on the street 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.080
 evidently 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.310
 and finally I'm going to teach the kitchen 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.850
 because the rest of the house does not have 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.850
 any sense 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.990
 the typical hall 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.990
 and good here is everything 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.149
 so a little more kids I hope that 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.149
