small minority of people and so we'll

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.530

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.930 
and clear the rights to the materials
it's<00:06:36.880> also<00:06:37.080> question<00:06:38.080> of<00:06:38.199> rights<00:06:38.470> which

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
it's also question of rights which

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.610 
it's also question of rights which
ironically<00:06:39.940> has<00:06:40.419> a<00:06:40.449> lot<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.690> do<00:06:40.900> with<00:06:41.050> some<00:06:41.590> of

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
ironically has a lot to do with some of

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.450 
ironically has a lot to do with some of
orson<00:06:42.100> welles

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
orson welles

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.830 
orson welles
own<00:06:42.699> efforts<00:06:44.009> now<00:06:45.210> of<00:06:46.210> course<00:06:46.419> this<00:06:46.600> never

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
own efforts now of course this never

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.670 
own efforts now of course this never
came<00:06:47.020> to<00:06:47.199> pass

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
came to pass

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.040 
came to pass
so<00:06:47.979> one<00:06:48.610> might<00:06:48.820> guess<00:06:49.060> that<00:06:49.090> interest<00:06:49.870> may

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
so one might guess that interest may

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.020 
so one might guess that interest may
have<00:06:50.229> accelerated<00:06:50.830> after<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.520> success<00:06:52.000> of
