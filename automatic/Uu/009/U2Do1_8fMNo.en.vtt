high you're going to hold it and now you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
high you're going to hold it and now you
can<00:01:25.740> reach<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:25.979> calendar<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.909> neat<00:01:27.390> little

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
can reach your calendar just neat little

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
can reach your calendar just neat little
things<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.560> again<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.159> heavily

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
things like that it's again very heavily

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
things like that it's again very heavily
modified<00:01:30.619> notification<00:01:31.619> panel<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.159> has

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
modified notification panel just has

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
modified notification panel just has
quick<00:01:32.579> toggles<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> find

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
quick toggles you're not going to find

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
quick toggles you're not going to find
any<00:01:34.710> notifications<00:01:35.369> until<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> guess<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.150> get

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
any notifications until I guess you get

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
any notifications until I guess you get
one<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.350> makes<00:01:37.500> sense<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.890> why<00:01:38.189> pull

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
one so it makes sense really why pull

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.300 
one so it makes sense really why pull
down<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> show<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.600> empty

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
down all the way and to show an empty

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.020 
down all the way and to show an empty
notification<00:01:41.310> area<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.939> no

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
notification area when there's no

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
notification area when there's no
notification<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> bottom<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
notification so on the bottom here is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.999 
notification so on the bottom here is
your<00:01:44.729> quick<00:01:44.970> settings<00:01:45.329> or<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.570> multitasking

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
your quick settings or your multitasking

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.109 
your quick settings or your multitasking
that's<00:01:47.009> how<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.220> would<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.939> most

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
