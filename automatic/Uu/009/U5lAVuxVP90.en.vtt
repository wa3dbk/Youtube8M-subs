00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
those infrared sensors so then the first

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.290 
those infrared sensors so then the first

overcoming these atmospheric distortions

its<00:02:35.670> weakest<00:02:36.060> part<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.720> fuel<00:02:36.959> tank<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.670> all

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
its weakest part the fuel tank so all

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.400 
its weakest part the fuel tank so all
you<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> do<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.360> hit<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.690> body<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.350> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you have to do is hit the body of that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.490 
you have to do is hit the body of that
tank<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.670> get<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.090> say<00:02:42.209> heat<00:02:42.450> up<00:02:42.660> unit<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
tank and get it to say heat up unit to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.039 
tank and get it to say heat up unit to
start<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> crack<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.120> he<00:02:45.239> explodes<00:02:45.780> from

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
start to crack and then he explodes from

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.150 
start to crack and then he explodes from
the<00:02:46.230> inside<00:02:46.650> out

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the inside out

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
the inside out
so<00:02:47.459> it's<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.819> catastrophic<00:02:48.209> failure<00:02:48.780> at<00:02:49.080> that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so it's a catastrophic failure at that

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.830 
so it's a catastrophic failure at that
point<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> from<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.519> time<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.330> first

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
point and from the time that that first

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.410 
point and from the time that that first
infrared<00:02:52.500> sensor<00:02:52.890> goes<00:02:53.130> off<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> time

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
infrared sensor goes off to the time

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
infrared sensor goes off to the time
that<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.810> missile<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.620> toast<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.580> be

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that that missile is toast can be

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.410 
that that missile is toast can be
anywhere<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.239> 8<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> 12<00:02:57.810> seconds
