00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
wouldn't be scientifically viable to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.070 
wouldn't be scientifically viable to
just<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.670> five<00:01:55.880> people<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.360> mean<00:01:56.540> what<00:01:56.990> are

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
just have five people I mean what are

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.609 
just have five people I mean what are
the<00:01:57.110> chances<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.330> only<00:01:59.360> ones

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the chances so we're not the only ones

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.570 
the chances so we're not the only ones
you<00:02:00.619> know<00:02:00.799> you're<00:02:00.950> not<00:02:01.040> allowed<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.310> access
