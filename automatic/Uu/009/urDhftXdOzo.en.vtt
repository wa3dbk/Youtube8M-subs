00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.700
- Have a seat, everybody.
Wow.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.100
Y'all are something else,
I'll tell you that.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.900
[cheers and applause]

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.000
Wherever that
birthday girl is...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.700
[laughter]

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.100
Yep.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.000
I think he got the present.
I don't know...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.600
[laughter]

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.966
Wow.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.033
Oh.
This is so--

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.766
oh, everybody got scooted down.
Okay.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.200
Thanks for being here.
You look like

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.066
you're in a good mood
and you're healthy and happy

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.700
and all that stuff.
And I hope you are

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.066
'cause people are sick.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.633
This is a big cold and flu
season this year, right?

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:32.800
You're all healthy?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.466
[audience agrees]
Good, I'm glad

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.566
'cause, boy, it seems like
everybody's got something.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.000
And I'll be honest,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.066
I asked if I could Skype
into this show for February.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.966
But my lawyer said
I have to show up.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.366
Or they could
take away my fortune, so...

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:51.100
[laughter]

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.533
This is a true story.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.033
Would you like to hear what
happened to me this morning?

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.366
[cheers]

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.300
Okay, true story.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.166
My barista took my order
and then sneezed everywhere.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.266
[groaning]

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.600
And I said, "Keep the change."

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.433
'Cause I didn't
want to touch it.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.900
And that sneeze cost me
$496 extra.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.666
Yes, for all days
to pay with a $500 bill.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.433
I...

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.100
True story.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.866
[laughter]

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.266
I know people get sick.
Sometimes you can't avoid it,

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.600
especially when there are
those little tiny molecules

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.966
travelling around everywhere
on every surface.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.333
Not molecules.
What are they called?

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.333
Children.
Uh...

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.966
[laughter]

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.466
Children.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.933
I think people need a refresher

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.200
on how to behave
when they're sick,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.933
so I'm here to help.
If you have to sneeze,

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.166
do the vampire sneeze.
Do it like that, in your sleeve.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.166
Then take your shirt off,
burn it.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.800
[laughter]

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.333
And then if you have a fever,
remember,

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.966
it's feed a fever,
starve a cold.

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.933
Or starve a fever, feed a cold.

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.366
Anyway, here's an easier rhyme.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:55.433
If you have a fever,
do not leaver your house.

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.500
And here's another one:
If you have a cold,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.566
do what you're told,

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:02.233
do not hold a subway poled.

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.666
They're not all gonna work.

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:04.700
Finally here's a good one.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Write this down, everybody,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.900
if you have a pen or pencil.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.433
If you don't,
just try to remember it.

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.866
Wash your hands.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:11.900
Always wash your hands.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.300
Before you eat,
after you eat,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.500
while you're eating,
between bites.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.066
If you're awake
and you're not doing something,

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:19.200
be washing your hands
the entire time.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800
And if you are sick
and you have to stay inside,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.733
I'm sorry, there's one way
you can feel better.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.033
Watch this show.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.200
It's the daytime, laughing,
smiling, learning,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.866
having fun so you can dance
medicine.
