00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi guys all right for those who do not 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.069
 You know my name is Priscilla at first. 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.210
 I still want to thank all the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.679
 new subscribers on my channel and for whom 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 want to sign up 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.760
 welcome everyone is this recipe 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 goes beyond 16 servings will give to 18 days 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.220
 being at lunch time dinner should be 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.230
 placed in containers suitable for 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 freeze baby booze 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.180
 remembering that before being frozen 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 they must be passed through the process of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 Cool it's ok, I'm going to talk about it now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.690
 the seasoning is not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 we all know that the child 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.020
 develops palate from birth 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 huh 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.329
 therefore it is necessary to temper the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.930
 foodstuffs in an appropriate manner and thus 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.800
 people stimulate or learn flavors 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 and the main rule is to use nothing a little 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 salt 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 we can season with herbs but always 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.860
 so in small amounts 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 It's like, for example, we might be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.689
 using garlic onion is olive oil 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 extra virgin right 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.590
 parsley scallion are oregano and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.350
 so will these natural seasonings not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.020
 problem since it is in small 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.890
 quantities are more careful people 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.820
 never add pepper occur by whom 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 favor 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 and then to offer the baby paps to the baby 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 Are you can adding in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.150
 each serving another type of food is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.549
 I added rice and bean stew 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 the idea for your baby in the game of 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.439
 final cup will be eight days right with the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.829
 same painted response by adding a 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 another food is always that was to offer 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.189
 baby pussy 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.460
 I also do not want to talk 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.060
 For you, the olive oil is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.610
 that being extra virgin olive oil is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.590
 in all the clothes of the Lord one 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 spoon yes but it is worth remembering that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 should be heated first by 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.800
 last to add the olive oil because 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.040
 because it is not advised to heat the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.140
 because the heat will reduce your 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.489
 functional properties, then the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.280
 tip 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.250
 and let's go to the ingredients let's go 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.160
 need a chopped tomato without skin and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.510
 seedless an onion and four cloves 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.970
 garlic, chopped 10 chopped baby potatoes 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.110
 can be any other potato 3 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.200
 shredded carrots a chopped one 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.870
 squash butter a portion of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.500
 leaf of chopped spinach and a potato 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:04.410
 sweet large chopped and 300 grams of meat 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.170
 soft and finally the pasta is a 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.640
 gourd noodles do not have a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.160
 right measurement 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.109
 usually puts it in my hand and plays it 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.820
 pot to cook then there are three 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.250
 Sometimes I do this 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.390
 so being so I would say that winning 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.900
 three hands of pasta is 3 hand full is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.519
 staff will be cooked in a pan 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.930
 separate and when the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.660
 Then I'll pour the water from the pasta and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.150
 I ambition in the chick and the last day I 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 Let's go for what matters is always good. 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.040
 remember that it is best for her to 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 cooking especially for your baby is 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.769
 the iron pot and in this recipe no 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.540
 would be using it until the day of 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.549
 video recording had not found 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.959
 To buy but thank god I 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.450
 found it 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.500
 I bought it in the next video for sure 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.900
 would be using in a pan we will put 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 oil cooking oil anyone who 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.959
 You 're there, and we'll be there. 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.220
 adoring the onion and the garlic 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.609
 then we will put the meat like this 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.239
 do not let the meat fry much, not only gives 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.959
 a light fry even had a golden 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.180
 huh 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.770
 and already there we add the grated carrots 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.090
 grated carrot we'll give too 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.289
 A trainee then she goes 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.780
 joining a normal water is not 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:46.820
 It's still necessary to have a relative go 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:49.140
 Just give a stir already joined the confiram 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.789
 now we're slowly going 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.789
 adding all the ingredients 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.120
 you should not put a lot of water you can see 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.389
 that I did not put much water and water 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.669
 always filtered water I 'm seasoned 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.970
 placing dry chives 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.160
 I'm not going to add salt to 1 more 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.090
 if you want to put it might be 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.090
 putting a little 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.569
 then the staff already with the ingredients 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.419
 all added I only put one more 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.189
 a little bit of water and a 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.860
 cover the pot and here it will stay 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:58.860
 cooking about 20 minutes 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:10.889

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.720

 pots like these 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.410
 and do the whole process right 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.840
 cooling and place in the freezer 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.970
 in this portion I added rice 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.690
 fresh a bean curd and a 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.990
