00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.299
 how nice we are half- way with 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:12.379
 new jobs and Mr. with cardboard in 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:16.460
 how to donate using the model that we 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.109
 It allows a lot to do and well it's a 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.380
 product that actually as it has 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.020
 so much acrylic base allows to have a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.210
 very good durability in the works 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.960
 that we make and apart 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.660
 generates these these things of power 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.109
 work with different materials and 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.149
 giving justice to the product what 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.879
 want to perform allows us to do 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.729
 work with sleeves to work with 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.890
 rubber brushes or bonda comb better 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.440
 said good that allows you to work what 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.739
 dries well and has very good adhesion 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.019
 so it's the model and very well if over 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.969
 cartons on cardboard ag in this case what 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.429
 I'm going to perform on wood but it's 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.309
 exactly in one of mine the utilization 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.040
 of the good product I painted it in the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.220
 yellow base so you can see 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.830
 because otherwise you would not be able to appreciate 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.240
 hold with a brush that is hard and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.750
 that allows us to generate a 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.880
 little bit of texture and texture does not go 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.980
 to be very thick so let's make a 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.460
 fine texture as if it were actually 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.260
 there are some iron that comes 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.200
 always as if it were melted and in 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.690
 actually has those reliefs good you 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.150
 we will generate that and we will wait 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.640
 that dries neither too thin nor too thick but 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.010
 let what we are going to do later 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.830
 I know what it looks like 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.170
 Once dry we'll paint 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.170
 with black all the base 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.310
 without looking exactly is all 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.740
 but I say undiluted without diluting what 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.710
 you can dilute if you want or tolerate 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.520
 perfectly but good acrylics 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.170
 from eureka have they have good runs very 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.350
 well and you can work very well with 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.690
 them so we perfectly painted it 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.060
 everything in black and there we will have one 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.490
 good basis prior to this that I did not say 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 but it is a detail only in the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.850
 work 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.710
 It has small cardboard cuts 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.110
 we are always going to paste it beforehand 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.360
 cardboard because in this case it is in a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.630
 iron but we can use it in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.960
 any other job more forming as 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.050
 if they were screws cutting cardboard 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.900
 then before that is cut it sticks 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.070
 everything is painted black included too 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.960
 the cardboard then that would stay like that 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.150
 and then in this way we can 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.320
 apply it on a wall that other 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.490
 unified wood 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.910
 one has a 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.730
 some column and can perform on 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 she with no presence whatsoever 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.340
 iron that looks great this is 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.680
 strong visually but very nice 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:16.090
 according to what he has exposed to good 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 designs 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.930
 so well then let's mix a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.739
 little bit of 100 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.370
 natural and shadow toast and mixing what 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.129
 let's let's apply it full because 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.860
 then we will dilute it if the two 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.920
 mixed colors if I want to throw it 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.950
 something more earthy or more reddish I can 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.010
 add a little bit of red then 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.180
 there we are going to play with another color more what 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.209
 we are modifying 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.120
 the rusty iron colors are many 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.109
 and very varied because we put it pure 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 because it allows us that way after 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:02.950
 play by giving 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.760
 the fall that iron has and also 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.209
 in between we can grab 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.010
 some cloth and go down the color and 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.290
 the intensity according to what you want 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.600
 because the plate notice that in the part 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.090
 back if you want you can show 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.760
 have 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.270
 also re small cuts that you 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.600
 allows you to see yourself more maybe you can see more 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.419
 there or we can not put a little more 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 from 100 to natural and in 100 to natural goes to 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.840
 also generate this a little bit more than 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.630
 lighter color and in between where 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.630
 are these little teeth cut too 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.090
 we place it and we remove it to 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.580
 that you can tell the difference between 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.560
 the cardboard above and let's say in this 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.889
 case would be a wall as would be the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.169
 iron or the product or what we want 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.389
 use it on what we want there is no no 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.889
 there is a limitation in the model in peace 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.900
 you can use it in any super 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.250
 anything in any kind after 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:09.270
 of product that you call cardboard, call yourself 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.060
 wood that is a wall is a product 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.310
 that having a low chalk content 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.050
 that is not what happens with the products of 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.000
 the real walls with which they paint 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.400
 this one has an adhesion that 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.590
 fundamental then you know that I do not know 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.600
 goes 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.940
 another detail that is important to know 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.910
 when I'm going to work on cardboard 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.770
 I'm going to give the base a white base 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.930
 white color is going to be that the cardboard does not 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.750
 I sucked automatically not of books 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.370
 because by absorbing it and the content of 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.980
 water that the product may have 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.660
 make it jump like that is not going to 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.520
 happen besides you save a little bit more 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.100
 create and save auto bouquets a little more than 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.590
 acrylic finally we would put a 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.140
 hand in a matte varnish hand because 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.410
 good the iron we want it shiny is 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.070
 old and we continue doing it how much 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.970
 everything we want to grow old if everything 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.390
 what we like the colors that are used 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.880
 to do this kind of skate is the 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:11.480
 Toasted shadow and the natural siena 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.840
 black base finishes yes and there 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.630
 we started and played a little bit what 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.970
 we stretch and I use a lot 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.750
 techniques that are watercolor given because 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.330
 allow you to play hard enough 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.009
 they are glazes 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.439
 and good is how I like to use 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.960
 they're going to see it a lot that I used that 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:34.330
 technique but good always used on 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.259
 some other material in this case the 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.810
 top secretito is this one 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.240
 celan africa to goal was not towards the 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.909
 Handle side cold porcelain modeling 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.550
 and then painted then start to 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.050
 look now all the old plates 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.449
 that they see there because there are many 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.729
 models one I can do the same in 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.830
 Larger sizes and good to play a 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.930
 little bit with this thing to decorate with 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.759
 little weight to put perhaps in a 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.159
 instant that it's light and have a 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.110
 old object an old object under 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.030
 cost has look great 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:12.060
 I will be able to do but I will not iron 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.060
 not inside
