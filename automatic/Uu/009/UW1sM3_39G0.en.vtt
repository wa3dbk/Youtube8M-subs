00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
to carry that through if at any point

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.430 
to carry that through if at any point
you<00:03:16.120> sort<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.390> lose<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.840> momentum<00:03:16.959> stop

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
you sort of lose that momentum stop

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.660 
you sort of lose that momentum stop
being<00:03:17.590> able<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.769> do<00:03:17.890> damage<00:03:18.070> things<00:03:18.400> become

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
being able to do damage things become

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.910 
being able to do damage things become
problematic<00:03:19.090> okay<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:19.810> he<00:03:20.170> can<00:03:20.350> he<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.650> get

as quickly as possible outcomes yet
another<00:04:20.570> weapon<00:04:20.930> he<00:04:21.440> may<00:04:21.590> even<00:04:21.620> choose<00:04:22.040> to

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
another weapon he may even choose to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.190 
another weapon he may even choose to
upgrade<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.820> which<00:04:23.000> would<00:04:23.180> make<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.600> 33

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
upgrade that which would make it a 33

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.110 
upgrade that which would make it a 33
which<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.500> would<00:04:24.680> be<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.830> nice<00:04:25.070> idea<00:04:25.280> indeed<00:04:25.730> he

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
which is would be a nice idea indeed he

his<00:04:49.460> own<00:04:49.700> healing<00:04:50.090> power<00:04:50.420> which<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:50.930> not<00:04:51.140> that

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
his own healing power which is not that

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
his own healing power which is not that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
good it's to health at most so this is a

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.340 
good it's to health at most so this is a
bit<00:04:55.550> awkward<00:04:55.670> now<00:04:56.060> he<00:04:56.120> can<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.630> course<00:04:56.870> nicely

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
bit awkward now he can of course nicely

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.890 
bit awkward now he can of course nicely

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
trade the for 5233 here and then still

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.240 
trade the for 5233 here and then still
get<00:05:00.050> another<00:05:00.350> creature<00:05:00.620> out<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.890> but<00:05:01.160> of

get another creature out of it but of

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.170 
get another creature out of it but of
course<00:05:01.430> he<00:05:01.520> does<00:05:01.670> leave<00:05:01.820> himself<00:05:01.940> vulnerable

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
course he does leave himself vulnerable

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.030 
course he does leave himself vulnerable
to<00:05:02.480> be<00:05:02.570> killed<00:05:02.840> by<00:05:03.080> that<00:05:03.110> 22<00:05:03.590> weapon<00:05:03.920> if<00:05:04.010> he

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
to be killed by that 22 weapon if he

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.160 
to be killed by that 22 weapon if he
does<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.270> let's<00:05:05.630> see<00:05:05.750> what<00:05:05.870> he<00:05:05.930> decides

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
does that so let's see what he decides

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.660 
does that so let's see what he decides
to<00:05:06.230> remove<00:05:06.410> there's<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:06.980> shuttle<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.340> pain<00:05:07.520> to

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
to remove there's a shuttle of pain to

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.310 
to remove there's a shuttle of pain to
get<00:05:07.790> rid<00:05:07.910> of<00:05:07.970> 33<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.720> thing<00:05:08.960> that's<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.140> much

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
get rid of 33 that thing that's a much

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.230 
get rid of 33 that thing that's a much
better<00:05:09.350> idea<00:05:09.620> then<00:05:10.310> he<00:05:10.430> kills<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.760> 22<00:05:11.030> takes

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
better idea then he kills the 22 takes

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.600 
better idea then he kills the 22 takes
one<00:05:11.480> less<00:05:11.720> damage<00:05:12.140> which<00:05:12.650> is<00:05:12.830> nice<00:05:13.040> but<00:05:13.400> he

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
one less damage which is nice but he

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.650 
one less damage which is nice but he
cause<00:05:13.820> he<00:05:13.910> doesn't<00:05:14.120> know<00:05:14.180> his<00:05:14.300> opponent<00:05:14.600> is

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
cause he doesn't know his opponent is

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.270 
cause he doesn't know his opponent is
sitting<00:05:14.870> on<00:05:14.930> upgrade<00:05:15.410> but<00:05:15.770> injured<00:05:16.100> blade

was<00:05:17.990> one<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.440> best<00:05:18.530> rom<00:05:19.070> could<00:05:19.220> have<00:05:19.310> done

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
was one of the best rom could have done

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.070 
was one of the best rom could have done
absolutely<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:20.390> was<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.600> right<00:05:20.750> thing<00:05:20.960> to

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
absolutely that was the right thing to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.890 
absolutely that was the right thing to
do<00:05:21.230> but<00:05:21.850> we<00:05:22.850> do<00:05:22.970> have<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.270> upgrade<00:05:23.630> card

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
available so okay and that does mean

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.120 
available so okay and that does mean
that<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.900> 22<00:05:27.170> weapon<00:05:27.560> that's<00:05:27.680> sitting<00:05:27.950> around
