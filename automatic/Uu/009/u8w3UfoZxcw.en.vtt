00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so I really like that a lot as you can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

within<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.790> cutout<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.170> huge<00:01:40.290> plus

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
within that cutout so that's a huge plus

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
within that cutout so that's a huge plus
one<00:01:43.020> thing<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.770> people<00:01:44.700> didn't<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.240> about

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this case was the the build I feel that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
this case was the the build I feel that
the<00:01:49.439> build<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.210> great<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.479> phone

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

here<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:58.189> where<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> plastic<00:01:59.969> seems

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
here we go where the plastic seems

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289
