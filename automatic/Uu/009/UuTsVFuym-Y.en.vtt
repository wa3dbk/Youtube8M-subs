00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
before I set this goal I thought a lot

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.670 
before I set this goal I thought a lot
of<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:23.970> climbing<00:00:24.510> goals<00:00:24.720> were<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.230> things<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of my climbing goals were just things to

do and I didn't really view a goal as
something<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> become

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.920 

climbing<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.519> fickle<00:00:52.789> thing<00:00:52.940> man<00:00:53.449> it's<00:00:53.719> a

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
could imagine myself being this

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:18.620 
could imagine myself being this
passionate<00:01:07.970> about

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.510 

over<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> last<00:01:19.840> year<00:01:20.259> as<00:01:20.680> I've<00:01:21.009> tried<00:01:21.460> to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
over the last year as I've tried to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.359 
over the last year as I've tried to
climb<00:01:21.970> every<00:01:22.689> five<00:01:22.900> 12<00:01:23.290> an<00:01:23.799> American<00:01:24.190> pop

climb every five 12 an American pop
canyon<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.440> realized<00:01:26.440> that<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:27.580> was<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
canyon I realized that that was in the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.090 
canyon I realized that that was in the
process<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.659> doing<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.110> was<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> process<00:01:29.740> of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
process of doing that was a process of

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.450 
process of doing that was a process of
becoming<00:01:31.380> working<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:32.649> goal<00:01:32.950> has<00:01:32.979> taught

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
becoming working on this goal has taught

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.749 
becoming working on this goal has taught
me<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> lot<00:01:33.820> about<00:01:33.970> what<00:01:34.240> I'm<00:01:34.330> capable<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.930> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
me a lot about what I'm capable of and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.480 
me a lot about what I'm capable of and
what<00:01:36.899> started<00:01:37.899> as<00:01:38.110> an<00:01:38.380> effort<00:01:38.490> overcoming

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
what started as an effort overcoming

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.960 
what started as an effort overcoming
injury<00:01:39.789> became<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:41.500> eye-opening

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
injury became a really eye-opening

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.660 
injury became a really eye-opening
experience<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.560> showed<00:01:44.950> me<00:01:45.130> what<00:01:45.159> I'm<00:01:45.460> capable

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
experience it showed me what I'm capable

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.380 
experience it showed me what I'm capable
of<00:01:46.119> doing<00:01:47.490> towards<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.700> latter<00:01:48.880> end<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
of doing towards the latter end of the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.899 
of doing towards the latter end of the
season<00:01:49.869> as<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.110> had<00:01:50.830> quite<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.310> few<00:01:51.550> twelves

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
season as I had quite a few twelves

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.550 
season as I had quite a few twelves
under<00:01:52.119> my<00:01:52.240> belt<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.630> started<00:01:53.020> experimenting

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
under my belt I started experimenting

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.340 
under my belt I started experimenting
with<00:01:53.800> harder<00:01:54.220> climbs<00:01:54.869> climbs<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> great

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
with harder climbs climbs and a great

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.040 
with harder climbs climbs and a great
range<00:01:56.619> I've<00:01:56.800> never<00:01:57.280> come<00:01:58.210> close<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.509> even<00:01:58.960> at

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
range I've never come close to even at

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.550 
range I've never come close to even at
my<00:01:59.170> best<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.899> connecting<00:02:01.899> moves<00:02:02.229> and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
my best and I'm connecting moves and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.210 
my best and I'm connecting moves and
feeling<00:02:03.539> progress<00:02:04.539> on<00:02:04.780> routes<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> used

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
feeling progress on routes that I used

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.999 
feeling progress on routes that I used
to<00:02:06.310> only<00:02:06.429> dream<00:02:06.729> about<00:02:07.319> but<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.440> also<00:02:08.619> helped

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
to only dream about but it also helped

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.469 
to only dream about but it also helped
me<00:02:09.100> learn<00:02:09.280> how<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.519> manage<00:02:09.819> my<00:02:10.179> expectations

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
me learn how to manage my expectations

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.009 
me learn how to manage my expectations
and<00:02:11.200> set<00:02:11.650> realistic<00:02:12.130> goals<00:02:12.660> after<00:02:13.660> my

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
and set realistic goals after my

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.740 
and set realistic goals after my
experience<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:15.370> goal<00:02:15.700> I've<00:02:16.090> decided

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
experience with this goal I've decided

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.410 
experience with this goal I've decided
to<00:02:16.900> set<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> goal<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.640> think<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.150> very

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
to set a goal that I think is very

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.589 
to set a goal that I think is very
realistic<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:03:17.270 

so<00:02:23.230> for<00:02:23.379> 2014<00:02:24.340> I'd<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.450> i'm<00:02:25.799> 5:14

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.530 

exactly<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> hard<00:03:18.000> part<00:03:18.270> for<00:03:19.070> me<00:03:20.300> there's<00:03:21.300> two

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
exactly the hard part for me there's two

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.210 
exactly the hard part for me there's two
moves

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
moves

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.420 
moves
I've<00:03:23.220> got<00:03:23.430> stick<00:03:23.960> other<00:03:24.960> than<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.260> I've<00:03:26.130> got

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
I've got stick other than that I've got

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.980 
I've got stick other than that I've got
it<00:03:26.580> all<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:27.060> three<00:03:27.330> parts<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:29.780> still<00:03:30.780> feels

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
it all in three parts so still feels

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.170 
it all in three parts so still feels
pretty<00:03:31.260> hard<00:03:31.470> right<00:03:31.590> now<00:03:31.740> but<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.220> think<00:03:32.910> it'll

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
pretty hard right now but I think it'll

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.180 
pretty hard right now but I think it'll
go<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.570> think<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.990> do<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:35.070> going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
go I think I can do it it's going

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.770 
go I think I can do it it's going
together<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.730> think<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.990> think<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:37.890> could<00:03:38.070> do<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
together I think I think I could do it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.840 
together I think I think I could do it
you<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.870> by<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.080> end<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> season<00:03:40.800> if<00:03:41.760> not

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
you know by the end of the season if not

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.410 
you know by the end of the season if not
sooner<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.410> long<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.680> keep<00:03:43.880> keep<00:03:44.880> balanced

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
sooner so long as I keep keep balanced

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.810 
sooner so long as I keep keep balanced
don't<00:03:45.840> get<00:03:45.990> it<00:03:46.080> too<00:03:46.320> obsessed<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.640> on

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
don't get it too obsessed and look on

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.910 
don't get it too obsessed and look on
other<00:03:47.940> stuff<00:03:48.270> too<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:49.350> I'll<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.830> this

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
other stuff too I think I'll do it this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.880 
other stuff too I think I'll do it this
season<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.430> fair<00:03:50.670> man
