00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 and 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.710
 check the nice thing about this kind of cars 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.209
 I always have the bond that exists with the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 everyday car if you are first with one 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.660
 Ferrari comfort ride or a thick one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 maserati or something like that are car enthusiasts 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.719
 always pressing dogs does not matter 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.730
 as far as what angle they come summer 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 but this feels more flavorful 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.339
 if you have a new wave r i think it is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.839
 nice to visit someone who is one 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.730
 has golf 4 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.199
 was in bmw m3 is nice to visit 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 someone in the old 3 series has that 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.499
 People have excitement with that brand and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.789
 they instantly fall in love with such a car 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.160
 so imagine you know someone has one 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.450
 audi a3 location you pair in says of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 dude I have a nice car come by 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.700
 so what 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.960
 the cows with this before driving to it 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 those reactions are always around 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510
 just it contained that cool cup 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.650
 downtime often suddenly sounds for the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 door is standing 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.830
 you always have a lot of fun to see at 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.450
 people who are already fans of the brand 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.740
 the anonymous as well as its always been 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 you can do an audi rs6 for example 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.970
 bank robbery is the we often made grave 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 because they are very anonymous and fast to 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.670
 Anonymous is rid of it he is super 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670
 fat 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 anyway standard 20 inch wheels to this one 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.930
 the 21 inch 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.299
 not normal well so you see all 4 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.830
 enormously widened and lowered in or wrong and 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.880
 I mean that positively 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.189
 paints saw a lot of negative comments 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.780
 about what role in the yellow I optional 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.710
 I like it personally but I am 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.180
 apparently the only one 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.770
 we have the anti lies flat the arc 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.930
 option in terms of tone mirror that people 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 see what you are wrong if you from there 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.229
 comes to drive 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 Well once again an instant computer 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.909
 this new audi rs6 is starting 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.649
 he is brilliant and why 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.630
 well especially what it is so much 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.950
 more dynamic first than the previous rss that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.240
 says about the previous car that was 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.770
 really a log thing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.630
 louis heavy engine on the nose that we 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.189
 just go straight and if you are cool 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.659
 because he is heroically spectacular 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.819
 power so I'm now not cars or 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.770
 sugar itself that wasn't nice just yes 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.000
 you know that weight that he had there 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.450
 burden of two never a nice sporty 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.459
 car 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.630
 so when I drove the RSI for half a year 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.679
 ago i thought yes this is so much 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 more fun and I'm a little worried 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.860
 about these gentlemen 6 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.479
 for he will be so nice if I rs4 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.310
 thought well that luckily he is fine 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.179
 is 100 kilos lighter than the previous one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.099
 if has thick 1900 but still and he is 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.530
 so much nicer to drive I really but 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.239
 never a that weight in very tight 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.440
 hairpins in this wet weather yes then get it 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.970
 your understeer then guidance or 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.880
 front wheels gone but in a gentle bend 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.410
 at high speed and then certainly in that 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 did not even have much of last day in it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.569
 start the highway that well for block 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.950
 to 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.170
 I was mistaken I arrived in the hills 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.579
 unbelievable that we temple you this 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.950
 device can hunt over to your liking 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.810
 don't have any pounds through which the nose and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.000
 the chin to the outside if you visit 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.319
 unless you are going to push the cent heart no 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.230
 you're going to have that and those people 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.609
 stubborn route forward and crown 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.959
 essential 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.190
 as far as distribution and that difference between 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.299
 18 and kind for torque vectoring and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.430
 Frack you send in a little under 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.739
 then send your your gas and the butt does 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.180
 him through that under the wheel 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.340
 yes and then you just have fun with one 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.579
 car of more than two tons in kilos it is possible 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.579
 so yes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.870
 I never really knew she was busy 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.180
 more excited in a negative sense about all 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 those pounds and I think back to the BMW 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.700
 m6 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.200
 and we are now in the comments too 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.560
 not grumpy but once in turns 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.820
 I thought yes he is so heavy and n log n 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.010
 have not been in this car and I think 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.550
 not that he is better than the M6 ​​country 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.300
 needs a little more 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.300
 expectation pattern 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 to say that but it does indicate 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.200
 how all this car has the market 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.550
 put that in that sense very much 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.810
 has succeeded in bidding for it 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.730
 what I expect such a car must be 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.120
 offer that which knew for nothing actually 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.120
 not 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.790
 there is the engine said it is already the uv 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.800
 fall behind from 5 to 0 14 years four 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.120
 point 0 v8 we hold two turbos and we 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.120
 supply 20 hp and 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.950
 from 580 hp 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.209
 trade in 50 newton meter torque with us 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.890
 registration to lie faster 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.890
 the sprint 3.9 to 100 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.860
 earn a second row of hope 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.319
 Ferraris and miss at the traffic light 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940
 certainly what old models yes practice brand 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.470
 you really do not hear that 20hp or more 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.470
 less that high beauty is common 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.629
 quiet high speed and gas and ethanol 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.620
 from and that extra torque of zinc is 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.670
 nice because you do that more often 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.370
 middle area is then very high in the 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.810
 fewer cars tour this and yes it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.850
 sharp edge that he has more 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 then those 14 a step over sound this one 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.949
 has a the dynamic outlet 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.949
 appoint 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.820
 almost embarrassing and singular and what not 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.820
 but with animals now 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.170
 evert total package filter actually 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.150
 almost literally the same inclusion as 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.360
 i made the half year with the rs4 avant 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.880
 back 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.110
 he has pebbles and must be audi rs 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.620
 this is not the case 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.230
 as dynamic as a jaguar xfr or something 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.150
 for that is something the plans are already 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.700
 who finds goodness of audio in design 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.170
 I fantastic even fouter than it was and 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.410
 think without complaints well fall 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.330
 fastest control it is definitely on the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.340
 highway then too is very light and then see 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.960
 you get a sword in 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.640
 this good what they mean by that 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.320
 board does not have to be difficult to 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.820
 to be sporty 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.470
 yes longer they are the right way it 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.720
 is better than before so I leave it there 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.100
 call it constructive criticism there 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.710
 go a lot through the chosen path and 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.710
 that knowledge never comes further
