00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.499
 We are in Sochi on the waterfront 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.010
 you can walk you can ride 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:49.720
 the bike path here is the promenade beach 50 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:54.620
 meters from here apartments for sale you see 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.280
 can we all rent something but how 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.280
 good quality 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:12.220
 This video is such an unusual person will put 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.220
 there are very good with children 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:36.409
 we came to the aquarium not hundreds of ski 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.740
 whether we have time to see the whole city is unlikely 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.020
 whether 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.020
 but anyway 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.790
 the fish are waiting for food and everything is fed therefore they 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.820
 all the time asking 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.770
 a bun or that kind of poop but kind 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.770
 some honestly burning this 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.620
 we are now in the very center of Sochi 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.210
 this is the city administration building here 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.460
 Olympic rings are wonderful here 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.030
 in my opinion such a pedestrian zone 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:12.620
 and see 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.620
 and palm trees and all sorts of tender trees 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.380
 shopping 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:35.390
 if anything at all surprising 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:45.750
 when you get to st. petersburg 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:49.680
 northern capital of Sochi 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.950
 here palm trees are amazingly very 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.950
 great 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.329
 impressed by our group 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.470
 It turned out that Sochi is a full-fledged resort not 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.470
 worse than any European 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.830
 magnificent hotels built mogu 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.540

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.470
 dust particles are not Georgian 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.820
 none of the mote no bulls anywhere 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.820
 not lying but just 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.090
 this is a sea ​​port building 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.670
 as I understand it was built by Stalin 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.670
 an era 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.649

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:26.149
