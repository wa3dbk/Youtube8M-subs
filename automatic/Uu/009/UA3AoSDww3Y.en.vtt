00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.060 

there's<00:00:10.670> no<00:00:10.940> really<00:00:11.270> like<00:00:11.480> clear-cut<00:00:12.080> way<00:00:12.380> as

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
there's no really like clear-cut way as

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.590 
there's no really like clear-cut way as
to<00:00:13.309> how<00:00:13.430> you<00:00:13.490> can<00:00:13.670> figure<00:00:13.880> out<00:00:14.000> your<00:00:14.150> drone

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
to how you can figure out your drone

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.200 
to how you can figure out your drone
control<00:00:15.050> range<00:00:15.350> in<00:00:16.040> EVE<00:00:16.369> Online<00:00:16.760> not<00:00:17.000> like

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
control range in EVE Online not like

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.609 
control range in EVE Online not like
there<00:00:17.450> is<00:00:17.600> like<00:00:17.630> how<00:00:18.110> you<00:00:18.170> can<00:00:18.350> figure<00:00:18.529> out

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
there is like how you can figure out

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.089 
there is like how you can figure out
your<00:00:18.740> targeting<00:00:19.369> range<00:00:19.580> or<00:00:20.110> or<00:00:21.110> your<00:00:21.349> DPS<00:00:21.860> or

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
your targeting range or or your DPS or

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.850 
your targeting range or or your DPS or
whatever<00:00:22.420> you<00:00:23.420> have<00:00:23.570> to<00:00:23.689> actually<00:00:23.860> undock

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
whatever you have to actually undock

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.660 
whatever you have to actually undock
your<00:00:25.430> ship<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.710> then<00:00:27.710> target<00:00:28.130> something<00:00:28.369> like

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
your ship and then target something like

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.369 
your ship and then target something like
a<00:00:28.699> ship<00:00:29.420> or<00:00:29.890> structure<00:00:30.890> with<00:00:31.490> your<00:00:31.670> drones<00:00:31.970> and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
a ship or structure with your drones and

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.049 
a ship or structure with your drones and
then<00:00:33.379> you<00:00:33.590> start<00:00:33.830> moving<00:00:33.980> away<00:00:34.280> from<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.820> at

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
then you start moving away from it at

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.600 
then you start moving away from it at
like<00:00:35.600> with<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.780> micro<00:00:36.140> warp<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.890> once<00:00:37.460> you

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
like with a micro warp on and once you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.960 
like with a micro warp on and once you
get<00:00:37.730> out<00:00:37.910> of<00:00:38.059> your<00:00:38.239> drone<00:00:38.449> control<00:00:38.840> range

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
get out of your drone control range

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.360 
get out of your drone control range
it'll<00:00:40.970> say<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.079> can't<00:00:42.320> are<00:00:42.920> your<00:00:43.130> drones

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
it'll say that you can't are your drones

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.760 
it'll say that you can't are your drones
can't<00:00:43.730> engage<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.630> target<00:00:44.989> because<00:00:45.380> you're

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
can't engage the target because you're

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.160 
can't engage the target because you're
too<00:00:46.040> far<00:00:46.280> away<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:47.329> you're<00:00:47.540> at<00:00:47.930> a<00:00:47.960> certain

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
too far away that you're at a certain

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.979 
too far away that you're at a certain
distance<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.130> then<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.300> have<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.600> be<00:00:50.750> within

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
distance and then you have to be within

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.560 
distance and then you have to be within
this<00:00:51.290> distance<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.309> have<00:00:53.120> your<00:00:53.270> drones

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
this distance to have your drones

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.110 
this distance to have your drones
engaged<00:00:54.020> target<00:00:54.770> that's<00:00:55.340> one<00:00:55.640> way<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> figure

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
engaged target that's one way to figure

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.430 
engaged target that's one way to figure
it<00:00:56.300> out

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
it out

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.889 
it out
another<00:00:58.100> way<00:00:58.309> which<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.910> like<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.180> use<00:00:59.539> is

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
another way which I like to use is

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.040 
another way which I like to use is
actually<00:01:00.410> use<00:01:00.920> an<00:01:01.190> external<00:01:01.840> fitting<00:01:02.840> tool

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
actually use an external fitting tool

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.100 
actually use an external fitting tool
where<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:03.530> can<00:01:03.649> kind<00:01:04.009> of<00:01:04.509> see<00:01:05.509> all<00:01:05.630> your<00:01:05.780> stats

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
where you can kind of see all your stats

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.520 
where you can kind of see all your stats
anyway<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.570> yeah<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:08.899> very<00:01:08.960> useful<00:01:09.500> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
anyway and and yeah it's very useful to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.130 
anyway and and yeah it's very useful to
have<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.130> what<00:01:10.399> I'm<00:01:10.550> using<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:11.060> pupae<00:01:11.509> Python

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
have so what I'm using is pupae Python

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.350 
have so what I'm using is pupae Python
fitting<00:01:12.500> assistant<00:01:13.009> I<00:01:13.220> think<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.209> can

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
fitting assistant I think you can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.840 
fitting assistant I think you can
probably<00:01:14.869> also<00:01:15.380> do<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.649> on<00:01:15.860> EFT<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.399> haven't

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
probably also do this on EFT I haven't

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.650 
probably also do this on EFT I haven't
used<00:01:17.090> EFT<00:01:17.569> in<00:01:17.899> a<00:01:18.410> very<00:01:18.740> long<00:01:19.009> time<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.450> have

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
used EFT in a very long time here I have

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.499 
used EFT in a very long time here I have
a<00:01:20.869> dominic's<00:01:21.470> fit<00:01:21.890> where<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.280> have<00:01:22.550> added<00:01:23.360> these

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
a dominic's fit where I have added these

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.960 
a dominic's fit where I have added these
two<00:01:23.990> modules<00:01:24.259> strong<00:01:24.890> link<00:01:25.130> arm<00:01:25.369> enters<00:01:25.729> which

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
two modules strong link arm enters which

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.270 
two modules strong link arm enters which
increased<00:01:26.479> my<00:01:26.599> drug<00:01:26.840> control<00:01:27.140> range<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:28.190> you

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
increased my drug control range and you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.400 
increased my drug control range and you
can<00:01:28.459> as<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:28.970> can<00:01:29.149> see<00:01:29.270> here<00:01:29.509> character<00:01:30.140> have

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
can as you can see here character have

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.070 
can as you can see here character have
selected<00:01:30.800> as<00:01:30.920> all<00:01:31.160> five<00:01:31.520> which<00:01:32.390> means<00:01:32.690> it's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
selected as all five which means it's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.800 
selected as all five which means it's
the<00:01:33.649> stats<00:01:33.920> are<00:01:34.130> four<00:01:34.369> if<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.270> were<00:01:35.630> to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
the stats are four if I were to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.620 
the stats are four if I were to
hypothetically<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.679> levels<00:01:37.640> five<00:01:38.179> skills

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
hypothetically have levels five skills

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.949 
hypothetically have levels five skills
across<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.349> board<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.580> can<00:01:40.759> also<00:01:40.910> add<00:01:41.300> my

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
across the board but I can also add my

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.520 
across the board but I can also add my
characters<00:01:42.500> via<00:01:42.800> API<00:01:43.250> keys<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.349> can

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
characters via API keys so that I can

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.770 
characters via API keys so that I can
import<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.490> skills<00:01:46.789> into<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.209> program<00:01:47.599> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
import the skills into the program and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.490 
import the skills into the program and
it<00:01:47.869> can<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.349> figure<00:01:48.530> out<00:01:48.709> all<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.729> stats<00:01:50.000> for

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it can like figure out all the stats for

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.150 
it can like figure out all the stats for
for<00:01:51.500> whatever<00:01:51.890> shape<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.340> want<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.670> fit<00:01:52.989> so<00:01:54.160> as

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
for whatever shape I want to fit so as

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.339 
for whatever shape I want to fit so as
you<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:55.459> see<00:01:55.520> here<00:01:55.940> down<00:01:56.420> here<00:01:56.479> drone<00:01:57.050> range

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
you can see here down here drone range

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.520 
you can see here down here drone range
is<00:01:57.739> 100<00:01:58.280> kilometers<00:01:58.660> with<00:01:59.660> this<00:01:59.869> fit<00:02:00.170> and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
is 100 kilometers with this fit and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.609 
is 100 kilometers with this fit and
these<00:02:00.709> skills<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> yeah<00:02:02.929> it's<00:02:03.170> pretty<00:02:03.410> useful

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
these skills and yeah it's pretty useful

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.660 
these skills and yeah it's pretty useful
