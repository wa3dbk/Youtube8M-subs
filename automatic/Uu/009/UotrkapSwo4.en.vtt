00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
divide it look at all these roots where

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.400 
divide it look at all these roots where
we<00:00:30.849> already<00:00:31.029> cut<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.360> foliage<00:00:31.629> back<00:00:32.079> as<00:00:32.290> you

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410

out to the drip line you can see how big

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.049 
out to the drip line you can see how big
this<00:00:41.410> plant<00:00:41.739> is<00:00:41.950> so<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.219> drip<00:00:42.430> line<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.820> at<00:00:42.940> the

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
this plant is so the drip line is at the

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.590 
this plant is so the drip line is at the
end<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:44.170> leaf<00:00:44.410> structure<00:00:45.010> here<00:00:45.600> Carol

exactly how you divide a painting on
right<00:00:59.950> how<00:01:00.309> far<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.760> roots<00:01:01.000> radiate<00:01:01.540> out

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
right how far the roots radiate out

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.049 
right how far the roots radiate out
beyond<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.590> plant<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:03.399> want<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.700> try<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.910> get

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
beyond the plant we want to try to get

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.670 
beyond the plant we want to try to get
as<00:01:04.180> much<00:01:04.329> work<00:01:04.509> as<00:01:04.659> possible<00:01:05.079> right<00:01:05.199> for

better success next year oh wow that is
a<00:01:09.759> big<00:01:10.000> one<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.969> this<00:01:12.969> is<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.149> good<00:01:13.329> time<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.659> do

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
a big one so this is a good time to do

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.709 
a big one so this is a good time to do
it<00:01:13.840> September<00:01:14.140> October<00:01:14.439> yes<00:01:15.310> uh-huh<00:01:15.670> oh<00:01:16.149> and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
they like to be moved so we don't have

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.889 
they like to be moved so we don't have
to<00:01:18.640> wait<00:01:18.789> for<00:01:18.999> the<00:01:19.060> foliage<00:01:19.299> to<00:01:19.420> go<00:01:19.539> completely

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
to wait for the foliage to go completely

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.629 
to wait for the foliage to go completely
down<00:01:20.259> you<00:01:20.499> can<00:01:20.649> just<00:01:20.679> start<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.130> now<00:01:21.310> that's

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:21.639 
down you can just start it now that's

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.029 
down you can just start it now that's
correct<00:01:21.969> and<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.329> we'll<00:01:23.020> have<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.259> couple<00:01:23.920> of

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
correct and so we'll have a couple of

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.620 
correct and so we'll have a couple of
plants<00:01:24.310> for<00:01:24.399> next<00:01:24.639> year<00:01:24.850> let's<00:01:25.329> go<00:01:25.450> over<00:01:25.569> to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
plants for next year let's go over to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.999 
plants for next year let's go over to
that<00:01:25.689> table<00:01:25.929> we<00:01:26.229> could<00:01:26.380> show<00:01:26.530> how<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:26.709> divide

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
that table we could show how to divide

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.889 
that table we could show how to divide
it<00:01:27.189> sure<00:01:29.069> okay<00:01:30.069> Carol<00:01:30.310> what's<00:01:30.759> next<00:01:31.179> well<00:01:31.869> this

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it sure okay Carol what's next well this

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.289 
it sure okay Carol what's next well this
has<00:01:32.200> been<00:01:32.469> all<00:01:32.950> washed<00:01:33.279> up<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.729> ready<00:01:33.939> for<00:01:34.209> us

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
has been all washed up and ready for us

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.179 
has been all washed up and ready for us
to<00:01:34.479> look<00:01:34.600> out<00:01:34.779> a<00:01:34.810> little<00:01:35.049> closer<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.560> we'll<00:01:36.009> cut

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
to look out a little closer so we'll cut

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.519 
to look out a little closer so we'll cut
the<00:01:36.340> stems<00:01:36.609> off<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.509> can<00:01:37.719> see<00:01:38.079> that<00:01:38.319> the

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
the stems off you can see that the

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.039 
the stems off you can see that the
growing<00:01:39.340> eyes<00:01:39.609> grew<00:01:40.029> on<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.240> sides<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.810> last

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
growing eyes grew on the sides of last

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.800 
growing eyes grew on the sides of last
year<00:01:41.319> stems<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.189> growing<00:01:42.490> eyes<00:01:42.759> make<00:01:43.569> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
year stems and the growing eyes make the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.080 
year stems and the growing eyes make the
stems<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.889> leaves<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.459> flowers<00:01:45.849> for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
stems and the leaves in the flowers for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.819 
stems and the leaves in the flowers for
next<00:01:46.389> year<00:01:46.569> so<00:01:46.599> it's<00:01:47.020> real<00:01:47.229> important<00:01:47.709> to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
next year so it's real important to

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.099 
next year so it's real important to
leave<00:01:48.009> those<00:01:48.249> on<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.819> we'll<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.659> cut<00:01:49.869> down

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
leave those on and we'll just cut down

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.289 
leave those on and we'll just cut down
right<00:01:50.439> above<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.829> eyes<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.429> we<00:01:51.880> want<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.149> make

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
right above the eyes and we want to make

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.359 
right above the eyes and we want to make
some<00:01:52.539> divisions<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.319> leave<00:01:53.499> eyes<00:01:53.799> on<00:01:54.189> each

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
some divisions to leave eyes on each

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.849 
some divisions to leave eyes on each
root<00:01:54.700> piece<00:01:54.999> this<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.170> original<00:01:56.649> root

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
root piece this is the original root

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.379 
root piece this is the original root
that<00:01:57.009> we<00:01:57.130> planted<00:01:57.579> here<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.029> can<00:01:58.179> tell

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
that we planted here you can tell

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.419 
that we planted here you can tell
because<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.869> darker<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.439> color<00:01:59.679> uh-huh<00:02:00.219> and

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
because it's darker in color uh-huh and

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.849 
because it's darker in color uh-huh and
so<00:02:01.209> we're<00:02:01.479> going<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:01.630> start<00:02:01.990> with<00:02:02.169> a<00:02:02.200> knife<00:02:02.529> and

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
so we're going to start with a knife and

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.149 
so we're going to start with a knife and
we'll<00:02:03.340> just<00:02:03.579> go<00:02:04.539> right<00:02:05.229> in<00:02:05.439> bright<00:02:05.649> way<00:02:05.770> in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
we'll just go right in bright way in

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.900 
we'll just go right in bright way in
between<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:06.990> stems<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.380> eyes<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.880> you

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
between the stems in the eyes and you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.100 
between the stems in the eyes and you
want<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.179> make<00:02:10.270> sure<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.450> get<00:02:10.539> some<00:02:10.720> roots<00:02:10.899> on

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
want to make sure you get some roots on

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.479 
want to make sure you get some roots on
it<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.560> eyes<00:02:11.739> yes<00:02:12.280> both<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:14.099> nice<00:02:15.099> sharp<00:02:15.430> knife

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
it and eyes yes both a nice sharp knife

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.470 
it and eyes yes both a nice sharp knife
so<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.209> have<00:02:16.300> nice<00:02:16.450> sharp<00:02:16.660> cuts

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.440 

Wow<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.739> thick<00:02:21.040> Wow<00:02:21.640> look<00:02:21.910> at<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
Wow it's really thick Wow look at the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.040 
Wow it's really thick Wow look at the
stem<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.950> missed<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.250> there's<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.550> nice

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
stem we missed so there's a nice

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.449 
stem we missed so there's a nice
division<00:02:26.050> there<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.560> cut<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.220> one<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
division there and I cut that one a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.710 
division there and I cut that one a
little<00:02:27.790> catch<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.300> we'll<00:02:28.480> take<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.019> off<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
little catch so we'll take it off and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.050 
little catch so we'll take it off and
there<00:02:32.019> would<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.319> nice<00:02:32.560> division<00:02:33.099> there<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
there would be a nice division there and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820 
there would be a nice division there and
you<00:02:34.180> might<00:02:34.330> trim<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.870> ends<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.410> roots<00:02:35.620> off

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you might trim the ends of the roots off

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.979 
you might trim the ends of the roots off
a<00:02:35.860> little<00:02:36.130> better<00:02:36.430> it'll<00:02:36.670> help<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.780> its

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
a little better it'll help it like its

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.630 
a little better it'll help it like its
new<00:02:38.170> home<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> little<00:02:38.650> better<00:02:38.950> give<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.489> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
new home a little better give it a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.460 
new home a little better give it a
reason<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.090> start<00:02:40.360> growing<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:40.840> its<00:02:41.019> new<00:02:41.230> home

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
reason to start growing in its new home

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
reason to start growing in its new home
and<00:02:41.739> there's<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.010> real<00:02:42.220> life's<00:02:42.430> division

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and there's a real life's division

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.880 
and there's a real life's division
that's<00:02:43.660> great<00:02:43.959> look<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.290> those<00:02:44.440> points<00:02:44.680> so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's great look at all those points so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.170 
that's great look at all those points so
these<00:02:45.010> are<00:02:45.160> all<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> be<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> new<00:02:45.819> stems

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
these are all going to be the new stems

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.780 
these are all going to be the new stems
for<00:02:46.420> next<00:02:46.630> year<00:02:46.810> as<00:02:46.989> leaf<00:02:47.410> stems<00:02:47.680> right<00:02:48.190> well

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
for next year as leaf stems right well

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.240 
for next year as leaf stems right well
that's<00:02:48.879> great<00:02:49.230> now<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.680> take<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> couple

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that's great now we can do take a couple

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.860 
that's great now we can do take a couple
more<00:02:51.489> out<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.910> clump<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:55.720> be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
more out of this clump we can just be

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.750 
more out of this clump we can just be
sure<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.200> leave<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:56.440> eyes<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.489> written

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
sure to leave some eyes on some written

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.150 
sure to leave some eyes on some written
pieces<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.540> need<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.860> look<00:02:59.860> at<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
pieces so you just need to look at the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460 
pieces so you just need to look at the
structure<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:00.880> bit<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.110> strong

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
structure a little bit you're a strong

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.589 
structure a little bit you're a strong
woman<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:02.920> look<00:03:03.130> at<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.280> yeah<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.420> looks

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
woman here look at that yeah it looks

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.660 
woman here look at that yeah it looks
like<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.959> got<00:03:05.110> there<00:03:06.099> growing<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.519> between

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
like we got there growing in between

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.780 
like we got there growing in between
some<00:03:07.120> eyes<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:07.630> we'll<00:03:07.810> pull<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.640> you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
some eyes so we'll pull that out and you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.850 
some eyes so we'll pull that out and you
can<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.180> why<00:03:10.599> we<00:03:10.870> went<00:03:11.079> out<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.349> ways<00:03:11.470> from<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
can see why we went out of ways from the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.559 
can see why we went out of ways from the
plant<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.310> dig<00:03:12.549> because<00:03:12.760> these<00:03:13.090> roots<00:03:13.390> are

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
plant to dig because these roots are

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.110 
plant to dig because these roots are
long<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.769> they<00:03:14.890> tend<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.220> radiate<00:03:15.670> instead<00:03:16.030> of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
long and they tend to radiate instead of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.990 
long and they tend to radiate instead of
going<00:03:16.450> straight<00:03:16.720> down<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.489> important<00:03:18.940> to

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
going straight down so it's important to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.490 
going straight down so it's important to
really<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.750> drip<00:03:20.079> line<00:03:20.290> when

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
really go out to that drip line when

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.350 
really go out to that drip line when
you're<00:03:20.650> digging<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.190> get<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.489> many<00:03:21.760> roots<00:03:22.120> and

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
you're digging and get as many roots and

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.930 
you're digging and get as many roots and
big<00:03:22.930> roots<00:03:23.170> as<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.410> can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
big roots as you can

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.729 
big roots as you can
so<00:03:24.940> we'll<00:03:25.120> trim<00:03:25.359> it<00:03:25.480> up<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.720> little<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.260> little

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
so we'll trim it up a little a little

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.590 
so we'll trim it up a little a little
bit<00:03:26.920> more<00:03:27.190> here<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.519> it's<00:03:27.880> ready<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
bit more here so it's ready to go in a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.170 
bit more here so it's ready to go in a
hole<00:03:28.810> okay<00:03:29.590> take<00:03:30.280> off<00:03:30.459> these<00:03:30.639> little<00:03:30.819> side

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
hole okay take off these little side

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.629 
hole okay take off these little side
roots<00:03:31.859> well<00:03:32.859> now<00:03:32.980> we're<00:03:33.130> going<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.459> over

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
roots well now we're going to go over

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.879 
roots well now we're going to go over
and<00:03:33.760> show<00:03:34.200> planting<00:03:35.200> one<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.650> we're<00:03:35.739> going<00:03:35.829> to

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
and show planting one and we're going to

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.530 
and show planting one and we're going to
go<00:03:36.010> over<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.280> another<00:03:36.370> bed<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.150> we're<00:03:37.420> going
