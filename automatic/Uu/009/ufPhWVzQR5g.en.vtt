00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the shriek bins in the center and this

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.749 
the shriek bins in the center and this
one<00:01:56.940> at<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> back<00:01:57.300> this<00:01:58.110> been<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.830> gas

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
one at the back this been here it's gas

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
one at the back this been here it's gas
bottles<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.300> mainly<00:02:00.900> storage<00:02:02.840> our<00:02:03.840> middle

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
bottles and mainly storage our middle

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
bottles and mainly storage our middle
been<00:02:04.820> used<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> go-kart<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.780> but

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
been used to have a go-kart in there but

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
been used to have a go-kart in there but
that's<00:02:07.050> taking<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.100> out<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.790> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's taking that out now so we use it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.780 
that's taking that out now so we use it
for<00:02:08.940> storage<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.350> their<00:02:11.720> third<00:02:12.720> bin<00:02:13.050> got<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
for storage and their third bin got a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.479 
for storage and their third bin got a
split<00:02:14.790> system<00:02:15.209> air<00:02:15.239> conditioning<00:02:15.870> unit<00:02:16.489> which

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
split system air conditioning unit which

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.670 
split system air conditioning unit which
which<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.150> need<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.570> we're<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.260> plugged<00:02:19.560> into

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
which we need if we're not plugged into

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.890 
which we need if we're not plugged into
power<00:02:19.920> we'll<00:02:20.250> use<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.850> generator<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.720> run

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
power we'll use the generator to run

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.350 
power we'll use the generator to run
that<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.160> have<00:02:23.459> our<00:02:23.489> toilet

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that and we also have our toilet

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.790 
that and we also have our toilet
canister<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:24.959> which<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.260> slides<00:02:25.620> in

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
canister here which is just slides in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.300

this a switch inside which we destroy

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.030 
this a switch inside which we destroy
the<00:03:09.599> generator<00:03:09.750> up

well<00:03:12.040> we<00:03:12.579> have<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> slide<00:03:13.090> out<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.499> bus's<00:03:16.049> it

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
well we have a slide out in the bus's it

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.170 
well we have a slide out in the bus's it
slides<00:03:17.439> out<00:03:17.590> 600<00:03:18.189> gives<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.609> appearance<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:19.090> a

slides out 600 gives the appearance of a
lot<00:03:19.329> more<00:03:19.359> than<00:03:19.540> 600<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.379> that<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:20.829> creates

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
lot more than 600 but that just creates

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.339 
lot more than 600 but that just creates
that<00:03:21.790> extra<00:03:22.150> space<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.719> makes<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.019> easy<00:03:23.200> to

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
that extra space and makes it easy to

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.649 
that extra space and makes it easy to
living<00:03:23.739> without<00:03:24.219> that<00:03:24.700> probably<00:03:25.389> wouldn't

living without that probably wouldn't

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.830

feel<00:03:25.930> as<00:03:26.139> roomy<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:27.939> just<00:03:28.659> makes

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
feel as roomy and and it just just makes

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.270 
feel as roomy and and it just just makes
it<00:03:28.959> quite<00:03:29.170> comfortable<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.769> don't<00:03:29.889> have<00:03:30.099> to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
it quite comfortable you don't have to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.819 
it quite comfortable you don't have to
sort<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:31.079> when<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.139> pull<00:03:32.319> up<00:03:32.379> somewhere<00:03:32.590> to

hence<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.919> sign<00:03:48.159> on<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> back<00:03:48.669> of<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.909> bus<00:03:49.090> I

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
hence the sign on the back of the bus I

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.360 
hence the sign on the back of the bus I
really<00:03:49.930> did<00:03:50.169> not<00:03:50.349> want<00:03:50.409> to<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.280> it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
really did not want to do this but it

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.770 
really did not want to do this but it
was<00:03:51.459> something<00:03:51.639> close<00:03:51.939> really<00:03:52.209> wanted<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.659> do

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
was something close really wanted to do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.199 
was something close really wanted to do
so<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.799> did<00:03:53.919> a<00:03:53.949> bit<00:03:54.069> of<00:03:54.129> research<00:03:54.219> we<00:03:54.819> looked<00:03:55.060> at

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
so we did a bit of research we looked at

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.199 
so we did a bit of research we looked at
caravan<00:03:55.689> motorhomes

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
caravan motorhomes

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.420 
caravan motorhomes
anything<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.329> everything<00:03:58.389> that<00:03:58.780> had<00:03:58.870> wheeled

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
anything and everything that had wheeled

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.659 
anything and everything that had wheeled
then<00:04:00.430> decided<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:02.199> persecuted<00:04:02.859> reasons

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
then decided that I persecuted reasons

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.220 
then decided that I persecuted reasons
wanted<00:04:04.060> something<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.540> if<00:04:04.840> we<00:04:04.959> were<00:04:05.019> pulled

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
wanted something that if we were pulled

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.929 
wanted something that if we were pulled
up<00:04:05.319> on<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.469> side<00:04:05.680> of<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:05.889> road<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.519> had

through and hop behind the wheel and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.839 
through and hop behind the wheel and
drive<00:04:09.879> away<00:04:11.040> there's<00:04:12.040> no<00:04:12.219> need<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.669> sort

drive away there's no need for that sort

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.099 
drive away there's no need for that sort
of<00:04:12.969> thing<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:13.239> there's<00:04:13.540> no<00:04:13.659> trouble<00:04:13.959> out
