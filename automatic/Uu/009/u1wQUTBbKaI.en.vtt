 you will never miss any of my 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 videos asked me this video what 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 I was thinking about the two new consoles that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.859
 it's xbox one sorry my pronunciation but 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.980
 Well so no I do not understand why 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.320
 pronounced so the X and the play 4 which 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is better advantages and disadvantages what 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 I will say it is nothing else what I know no 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 I'm going to walk inventing them I'm not a 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 subject expert and I would love for the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 people rather than take it as an insult 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 towards your console or anything else 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 that tell me what they think 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 you in a peaceful quiet way 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 you do not necessarily have to get there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 attacking because well we know 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.059
 that there are quite a few people who arrive 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 Attacking without knowing is better than me 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.840
 say good look sergio is good you 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.549
 you were wrong why you said this and me 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 I think this is a way 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.160
 perfect 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.600
 sign that I am wrong but if 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.980
 they come to insult me because I'm going to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.590
 think of you who are the people 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.330
 who do not know how to talk then I'll go 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.480
 to tell them what I think of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 these two consoles first good the xbox 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.600
 xbox as you want to say one the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.120
 number one second because good since already 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.710
 there were two other consoles but good as 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.050
 who want to be the new generation 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.120
 good or that the name because the truth is not 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 the name matters a lot even 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.410
 does not matter the design of the console 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.940
 I did all the control because good the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 control you have it in your hand all the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.479
 time and it's almost the same as the control 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.860
 passed with some with some changes 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 the control is fine the truth is that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 well you can see that it will be comfortable 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940
 to adapt very well to your perfect hand 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.520
 as for the games they have taken out very 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.500
 good games but but but 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.090
 practically the games that have taken 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.550
 for play station 4 and xbox or 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.520
 practically the same only because the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.899
 exclusive differences I do not want 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 get into both the theme of the games 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.050
 but in things and I think they are 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 top 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.210
 because I really believe that practically 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.550
 It was the same until I saw the conference 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.130
 of the playstation 4 that good first 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:29.790
 that nothing the price of the xbox is going to be worth 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 500 dollars 499 dollars and the playstation 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.970
 4 vouchers 399 dollars or a difference 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.100
 of $ 100 that I think good brand 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.670
 a lot because good if they are practically 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.730
 the same and so this difference of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.820
 price as it marks a lot or I 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.710
 buy something of $ 500 something of 400 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.080
 dollars that is practically the same 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.510
 obviously I'm going to go for 400 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.360
 number 2 dollars are going to say that I am a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 fan of playstation 4 but not me I guide 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.410
 run for me for what I 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.700
 I deduce and this I am recording 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.220
 practically after seeing the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.850
 conference so they do not think I'm going 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.740
 to be super prepared the second part 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.410
 is that you do not need to be connected to the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.180
 playstation 4 and I think the xbox the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.080
 true do not correct me if I'm wrong 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.930
 it has to be at least with 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.240
 once every 24 hours something like that 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.770
 this is correct me if I'm wrong I do not 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.990
 I get angry if they correct me in a way 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.280
 kind really forgive me if I'm not 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.650
 saying as much rudeness as 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.320
 I'm used to but I try not to sound 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.940
 so bourgeois or something like that because then of 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.060
 I would really like to give you information 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.580
 well and number I do not know what number I was going 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.380
 but good the next part is that no 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.750
 necessarily have to be connected 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.400
 all the time the playstation 4 or not 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.470
 it has to be connected obviously 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 blind online and all that but does not have 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.460
 that being connected is I think 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.220
 perfect 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.620
 well I did not understand very well what of the xbox 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.690
 Well, well, you will be able to see the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.900
 television I think it's you're not going to have 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.870
 to be changing the video mode not 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.910
 I know directly from the console you go to 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.770
 to be able to watch TV or watch TV in 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.110
 your television as if you could not access 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.940
 no but less I do not care no matter 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.100
 but the games themselves the two consoles 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.820
 they are good the two consoles are very 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.420
 good but something that I think broke him 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.730
 the face straight to the xa the xbox sorry 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.830
 I'm already with the x I'm with the x sorry 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.380
 what broke his face once you can 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.750
 use games used in the playstation 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.890
 4 you can use all used or that is 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.330
 if suddenly by saying you and your friend 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.100
 francisco I do not know with me for your 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.630
 friend or your friend now does not 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.550
 determined a game and who wants it 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.590
 lend well you will be able to perfectly 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.330
 thing that in the in the xbox or you're not going to 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.160
 power is going to be a big disadvantage to 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.050
 the microsoft console at the time of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.630
 this this just happened is a great 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.550
 disadvantage for them since then neither 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.130
 how to help you with that used games 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.840
 because I do not think they should 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.880
 take it off 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.699
 I think there's still time to do it 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.770
 remove that because they are going to lose many 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.730
 customers I think the two consoles 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.620
 they're good 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.740
 here I showed the differences and I think that 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.130
 what most differentiates this is the price 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.979
 and also about the games used I think 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.630
 which is something key to this then in 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.970
 microsoft still have the opportunity 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.490
 of removing that from also removing what 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.430
 online that is or 24 hours online no no 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.660
 no no no no at least once every 24 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.639
 hours do not believe that all the time has 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.430
 to be connected then remove that 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.530
 please obviously you are not going to see this 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.810
 but I mean that that would not save 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.450
 is this competition that has been winning 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.300
 They are, in my opinion, many people think 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.820
 that the games of the company of 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.150
 microsoft are better others think that 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.550
 the sony console is not so good 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.130
 as for this but, the truth is, I 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.169
 I see that the go are very similar I see 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.990
 that the price changes I see that the 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.940
 processed as they command the games 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.139
 used and suddenly someone finishes the 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.000
 I play because there are eggs that you 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.110
 you finish so fast that he did it is good but 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.260
 because I bought it 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.760
 you can sell and this does not allow you 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.730
 microsoft then good will have to see 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.900
 this you get me with good if not 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.360
 you agree with what they 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.860
 saying tell me in a kind way not 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.170
 you necessarily have to get there 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.720
 insulting me I did not try to be what 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.670
 kindest possible subscribe if you 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.080
 liked the video leave your comment and 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.580
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.200
 he also called me quite a laugh in the 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.740
 conference that was playing the guy 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.840
 is when you are enrolled 3 I say 4 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.420
 sorry I think that's the truth 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.580
 Well, I know that 13 is the last one 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.080
 he left then he was playing 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.900
 super prototype 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.060
 like everything a killer in the game when 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.710
 suddenly the video was passed and good 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.080
 we discovered that it really was a 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.360
 playback that really sad but then 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.070
 good is funny in games like script 4 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.770
 I 'm waiting for you too much it's both 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.940

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.350
 video see you a hug and good 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.480
 comment what do you think about this and what is it 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.970
 what do you think about it because one 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.340
 consoles seems the best to you and 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.320
