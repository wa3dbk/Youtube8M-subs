 woodstock wood log high performance 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.430
 is an innovative and powerful product 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.390
 suitable for all heaters 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 with wood log 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.879
 the product is from a process 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770
 unique industrial in europe 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.280
 with a modern production cycle 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.280
 ecological 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.130
 local woods are 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.530

 enjoyed age routed to the lines 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.730
 automated production logs 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.160
 are then cut in a length 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 constant and always split in section 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.970
 very regular buses are then 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.220
 brought in a sieve rod for 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.800
 eliminate as much as possible small wood and Corsican 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.280
 lichen mosses and insects in order to 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.350
 have a clean wood drying 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.170
 allows to obtain a hygrometry of the wood 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.479
 between 15 and 20% which guarantees a power 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 very important calorific and so a 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.950
 economical and efficient fuel the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.470
 wood will iron in drums and corsair 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.700
 Before being conditioned the product is 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.680
 made available in a

 innovative and practical packaging on 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.619
 pallet optimizing storage and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.900
 handling 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.520
 delivered under waterproof film the wood what 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 is protected from the weather and from 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.970
 the humidity the opening of the ball to the east 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.970
 simple and access to the easiest 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.259
 with woodstock wood log high

 traditional wood constraints drying 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.340
 and full-bodied their firing is facilitated 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.140
 immediate heat input 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.009
 fouling and ash volume 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.009
 significantly reduced
