on<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> dyno<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> gains

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
on the dyno and see what kind of gains

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:28.830 
on the dyno and see what kind of gains
we<00:01:09.090> get

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840
