00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.319 
you know this pyramids got a great loot
and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:14.860> also<00:02:15.099> if<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.180> actually

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
and then also if you if you actually

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.080 
and then also if you if you actually
activate<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.739> T<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.310> what<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.579> I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
activate this here T so what if I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.339 
activate this here T so what if I
if<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.269> were<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.720> probably<00:02:20.230> just

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
if I were you I would probably just

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.220 
if I were you I would probably just
destroy<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.980> dig<00:02:21.519> down<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:23.200> through

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
destroy it dig down and just go through

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.130 
destroy it dig down and just go through
the<00:02:23.560> TNT<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:25.000> basically<00:02:25.120> let<00:02:26.050> me

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the TNT here but basically let me

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.990 
the TNT here but basically let me
actually<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.069> should<00:02:27.250> probably<00:02:27.370> repair<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
actually I should probably repair that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000 
actually I should probably repair that
just<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.450> show<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.810> exactly<00:02:29.080> okay

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
just so I can show you exactly okay

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.410 
just so I can show you exactly okay
let's<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.730> repair<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.090> request

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
let's actually just repair this request

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630 
let's actually just repair this request
and<00:02:31.720> Kabang<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.830> let's<00:02:33.069> watch<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.430> explode

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
and Kabang now let's watch it explode

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.390 
and Kabang now let's watch it explode
here<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> once<00:02:34.959> exploded<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:38.290> will<00:02:38.620> reveal<00:02:39.190> a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
here and once exploded it will reveal a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.300 
here and once exploded it will reveal a
ravine<00:02:40.120> from<00:02:40.870> underneath<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.099> cool

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
ravine from underneath and it's cool

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.890 
ravine from underneath and it's cool
because<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.879> actually<00:02:43.030> fall<00:02:43.420> down<00:02:43.660> you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because if you actually fall down you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.300 
because if you actually fall down you
probably<00:02:44.200> won't<00:02:44.410> die<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.620> can<00:02:44.860> actually<00:02:45.129> jump

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
probably won't die you can actually jump

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.009 
probably won't die you can actually jump
to<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.549> ledge<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.209> then<00:02:46.360> jump<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.750> like<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
to this ledge and then jump to like this

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.089 
to this ledge and then jump to like this
ledge<00:02:47.200> or<00:02:47.349> something<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:47.950> some

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
ledge or something and then you get some

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.559 
ledge or something and then you get some
bats<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:48.580> get<00:02:48.730> out<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:48.910> here<00:02:49.000> stop<00:02:49.330> trying

going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.060> go<00:03:34.209> right<00:03:34.630> first<00:03:35.019> because<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.470> comes

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
going to go right first because it comes

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.069 
going to go right first because it comes
to<00:03:36.099> an<00:03:36.220> end<00:03:36.370> over<00:03:36.609> here<00:03:36.819> we<00:03:37.599> just<00:03:37.780> got<00:03:37.900> all

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
to an end over here we just got all

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.780 
to an end over here we just got all
these<00:03:38.260> minerals<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.980> already<00:03:39.130> sort<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.549> did<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
these minerals I already sort of did a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.490 
these minerals I already sort of did a
little<00:03:40.359> bit<00:03:40.569> of<00:03:40.599> search<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.049> couldn't<00:03:41.260> find

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
little bit of search and couldn't find

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.199 
little bit of search and couldn't find
much<00:03:41.769> diamonds<00:03:42.340> there<00:03:42.519> might<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.670> some<00:03:42.970> under

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
much diamonds there might be some under

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.240 
much diamonds there might be some under
the<00:03:43.299> water<00:03:43.510> or<00:03:43.780> under<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.410> lob<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.829> here<00:03:45.040> or

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
the water or under the lob up here or

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.860 
the water or under the lob up here or
actually<00:03:45.639> if<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.819> dig<00:03:46.060> in<00:03:46.239> somewhere<00:03:46.480> there

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
actually if you dig in somewhere there

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.930 
actually if you dig in somewhere there
might<00:03:47.079> be<00:03:47.109> some<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:48.040> i<00:03:48.069> have<00:03:48.250> no<00:03:48.430> idea<00:03:48.579> cuz<00:03:48.880> I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
might be some but i have no idea cuz I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.960 
might be some but i have no idea cuz I
didn't<00:03:49.150> do<00:03:49.239> in-depth<00:03:50.230> exploration<00:03:50.799> but<00:03:51.730> yeah

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
didn't do in-depth exploration but yeah

you can come over here there's a whole

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.710 
you can come over here there's a whole
bunch<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.400> lava<00:03:54.669> down<00:03:55.000> here<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.419> bunch<00:03:55.599> of

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
bunch of lava down here a bunch of

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.080 
bunch of lava down here a bunch of
cobblestone<00:03:56.169> some<00:03:56.500> oh<00:03:56.680> butter<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.700> then<00:03:57.970> we

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
cobblestone some oh butter and then we

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.240 
cobblestone some oh butter and then we
got<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.239> coal<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.959> iron<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.470> then<00:03:59.919> if<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.130> come

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
got a coal and iron and then if we come

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.460 
got a coal and iron and then if we come
up<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:00.430> there's<00:04:00.880> tons<00:04:01.389> of<00:04:01.660> little<00:04:02.169> cave

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
up here there's tons of little cave

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.500 
up here there's tons of little cave
systems<00:04:02.919> branching<00:04:03.489> off<00:04:03.639> from<00:04:03.669> this<00:04:04.120> ravine

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
systems branching off from this ravine

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.379 
systems branching off from this ravine
you<00:04:04.720> guys<00:04:04.870> can<00:04:05.049> go<00:04:05.169> explore<00:04:05.590> those<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.639> if<00:04:07.150> we

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
you guys can go explore those but if we

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.080 
you guys can go explore those but if we
go<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:08.049> way<00:04:08.290> if<00:04:08.380> we<00:04:08.500> go<00:04:08.620> down<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.700> left

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
go this way if we go down and left

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.780 
go this way if we go down and left
instead<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:11.160> we'll<00:04:12.160> come<00:04:12.400> up<00:04:12.579> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
instead of right we'll come up to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.670 
instead of right we'll come up to
something<00:04:13.180> really<00:04:13.599> interesting<00:04:13.870> actually<00:04:14.260> so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
something really interesting actually so

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.490 
something really interesting actually so

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
as you can just see this ravine just

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.250 
as you can just see this ravine just
blended<00:04:18.310> with<00:04:18.880> another<00:04:19.389> ravine<00:04:19.810> like<00:04:20.109> a

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
blended with another ravine like a

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
blended with another ravine like a
straight<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.160> an<00:04:21.280> extra<00:04:21.729> large

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
straight on this is an extra large

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.980 
straight on this is an extra large
ravine<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:23.740> horizontally<00:04:24.490> wise<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:25.960> a

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
ravine like horizontally wise this is a

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.980 
ravine like horizontally wise this is a
pretty<00:04:26.349> big<00:04:26.650> ravine<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.370> let's<00:04:27.580> get<00:04:27.729> going<00:04:27.990> the

and we take a little right in here we'll
see<00:04:34.490> some<00:04:34.700> diamond<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.690> was<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.200> cool

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
see some diamond and I was like a cool

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080 
see some diamond and I was like a cool
Diamond<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.130> know<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.280> expected<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> see<00:04:38.060> a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
Diamond you know I expected to see a

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.330 
Diamond you know I expected to see a
little<00:04:38.270> bit<00:04:38.450> of<00:04:38.510> diamond<00:04:38.900> than<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.190> in<00:04:40.190> this

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
little bit of diamond than this in this

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.840 
little bit of diamond than this in this
ravine<00:04:40.790> but<00:04:41.200> yeah<00:04:42.200> actually<00:04:42.530> there<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.640> not

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
ravine but yeah actually there is not

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.940 
ravine but yeah actually there is not
just<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.240> little<00:04:44.630> bit<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.870> diamond<00:04:45.290> in<00:04:45.470> fact

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
just a little bit of diamond in fact

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.350 
just a little bit of diamond in fact
it's<00:04:46.910> seven<00:04:47.870> pieces<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.740> diamond<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.340> yeah<00:04:50.090> I

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
it's seven pieces of diamond and yeah I

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.080 
it's seven pieces of diamond and yeah I
know<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.900> as<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.080> lot<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.470> mean<00:04:51.650> if<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.940> is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
know that as a lot I mean if this is

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.370 
know that as a lot I mean if this is
probably<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.390> most<00:04:53.480> diamond<00:04:53.840> I've<00:04:53.990> ever<00:04:54.200> seen

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
probably the most diamond I've ever seen

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.910 
probably the most diamond I've ever seen
in<00:04:54.530> one<00:04:54.560> vein<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:55.880> not<00:04:56.410> close<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.740> most

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
in one vein if not close to the most

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.290 
in one vein if not close to the most
i've<00:04:58.100> seen<00:04:58.130> because<00:04:58.640> I<00:04:58.790> mean<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.030> don't<00:04:59.180> ever

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
i've seen because I mean I don't ever

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.400 
i've seen because I mean I don't ever
really<00:04:59.510> recall<00:04:59.960> seeing<00:05:01.630> seven<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:02.840> if<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.260> I

really recall seeing seven but if I if I

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.050 
really recall seeing seven but if I if I
did<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:03.980> probably<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.400> forgot<00:05:04.550> but<00:05:05.030> I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.930 
seven blocks of diamond there you guys
go<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.810> this<00:05:18.080> is<00:05:18.320> pretty<00:05:18.470> much<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.730> guess

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
go so this is pretty much this I guess

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.240 
go so this is pretty much this I guess
could<00:05:20.420> technically<00:05:21.140> make<00:05:21.470> up<00:05:21.680> what<00:05:22.040> that

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
could technically make up what that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.250 
could technically make up what that
ravine<00:05:22.640> doesn't<00:05:23.150> have<00:05:23.300> because<00:05:23.390> there<00:05:23.810> are<00:05:23.990> no

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260
