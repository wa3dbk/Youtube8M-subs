today it's 4pm the beta still isn't
working<00:04:34.050> now<00:04:34.919> could<00:04:35.699> my<00:04:35.819> code<00:04:36.150> be<00:04:36.449> bad<00:04:36.630> could

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
working now could my code be bad could

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.260 
working now could my code be bad could
it<00:04:36.990> be<00:04:37.080> as<00:04:37.380> simple<00:04:37.590> as<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.889> typo<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.400> my<00:04:38.610> code<00:04:39.000> I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
it be as simple as a typo on my code I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.620 
it be as simple as a typo on my code I
suppose<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.349> but<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:41.310> only<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.849> one<00:04:42.060> code<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:42.599> i

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
suppose so but I only have one code so i

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.510 
suppose so but I only have one code so i
guess<00:04:42.900> what<00:04:43.050> i'd<00:04:43.139> like<00:04:43.169> to<00:04:43.440> ask<00:04:43.860> everyone<00:04:44.069> is

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
guess what i'd like to ask everyone is

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670 
guess what i'd like to ask everyone is
