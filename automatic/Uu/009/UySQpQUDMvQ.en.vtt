00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:15.500
 friends and clear 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.779
 hello a lot 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.000
 we are already here welcome 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.489
 thank you let's continue today cold but 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.170
 let's explain a little bit then look at the wave 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.059
 of recycling is fashionable right now 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 so let's do something super nice 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.960
 which is a guacal we will use the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 crates and let's make a small 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 garden can put you from seeds and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.820
 raise your own vegetables until 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 put him 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 little flowers can peppermint 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 you can put herbs for the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 peppermint 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 since it is in the pot it perfumes very 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.120
 rich where where you have it smells very 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.190
 rich and to be mojitos is one thing 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
 someone gains citizenship a league of 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.060
 flown preparation the patita with 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 basil when you want but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.700
 other than the part that is fashionable 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 recycling 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.570
 and if the goal is very cure is very father 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.300
 but we do the planet well and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 we are all integrating into the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.880
 planet that minimal when he left loving 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.390
 to the pachamama je sex la pachamama la 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 Mother Earth 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.760
 but then what does it look like? 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 we start ready I need I need is 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.780
 a couple of muscles that we need 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.720
 many muscles to hammer for 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:50.150
 nail for many many because the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 we have no water 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.330
 and we're going to need a super sandpaper 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.370
 wait up 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.550
 for Carlos because because the vowels 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.660
 they are generally very deteriorated and 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.610
 you have to be very careful if we're 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.950
 to gloves much better 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:14.510
 we have that while I explain 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.510
 nothing the same 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.110
 the best thing is to cut it and the convert 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.580
 everything you give a little bit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.190
 I'm going to teach the other vocal and there's a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.709
 little is all a review of what I 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.930
 entered the name etc 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.670
 between our second crate which already 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.150
 I bring it butchered because it's going to 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.530
 serve much better poor and that what 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.390
 let's do let's unlock 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.920
 obviously so that times with 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.840
 work you have to look for that you do not have 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.330
 all these pieces of etiquette that we 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.490
 paste the name that does not bring anything and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.930
 Here we have what we are going to do 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.349
 a is nailing the parts 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.290
 is to nail a law was finished I like 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.969
 we're going to need all the planets not 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 I know what to modify this week here in the 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.939
 banks this the huacal believes that is this 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.950
 this is going to be our legs if you 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.340
 they are fixed is very happy or very 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.650
 fast is falling apart where 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.700
 you took out is one of the following 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.230
 subscribe envy is not we going to 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.989
 use it one hundred percent of the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.909
 projects then we need two strips 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.069
 of these are the ones that we are going to grab 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.709
 here I know how to shout and we're going to 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.450
 go see and we will need is everything 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.739
 we 're going to paint it in brown because 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.389
 is the color brown because it is a color 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.189
 rustic is fashionable and can be combined 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.169
 with many things here we are going to 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.790
 combine with a little pink we have 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.629
 green we have purple but the colors 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.930
 with chocolate coffee we are very 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.760
 fashion is already stabilized let's see 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.859
 how the difference looks the painted 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.640
 It has a lot to see, I recommend them 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.890
 who buys 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.210
 and acrylic because because if they are not going to 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.209
 take like 10 of these goals from 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.400
 difference this one resists exteriors 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.990
 also the vinyl is the biblical the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.580
 You can use acrylic only 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.220
 you would have to use a coating like 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.510
 of enamel to wear them today here do not 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160
 we are using because it is an interior 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.709
 but it's only going to be on an exterior 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.000
 put then place and let it rest 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.560
 like two days so it does not fly anymore 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.030
 face aside if we want to have it in the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.620
 yard so that endurance is better with 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.180
 vinyl and you can have it in the yard 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.710
 you can have it inside 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.140
 Well, this role will not continue in the 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.610
 surface I always have some people or 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.320
 anything because we are also going to 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.900
 use silicone let's put a little 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.449
 of water we take 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.979
 and we want the paint to run too 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.690
 we need to save a little bit of 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.560
 painting then let's start to give it 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.970
 to all our very effective crate that 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.560
 It has different 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.789
 you vein the wood then we go to 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.740
 follow them to make it much more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.240
 simple hey frida and where can we 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.699
 get a vowel for those who do not 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.830
 let's know in any market even you 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.840
 he gives it all this and the truth is that 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.240
 they charged me in four pesos and the one 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.940
 and the other one gave it to me they gave us 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.830
 because you wasted you know what it is in 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.110
 lots and lots of garbage outside 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.720
 markets and it's a shame the good ones of 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.039
 very nice things as we see is a box 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.539
 wooden and roofless 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.979
 real walker subsidy boys 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.160
 trade assured nothing else you put there 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.500
 you sit on top of me and I do not contact 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.510
 that was sure we're not going to need 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.300
 a brush this is a round brush with 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.670
 this technique is called dry brush no 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.340
 We need you to be very 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:35.170
 full of paint can be decoration 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:45.340
 from the time of finishing it 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:47.500
 the corners of hearts the portlights 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.350
 well it's fine and let's do it 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.870
 different 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:57.639
 and we put the stencil and 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.439
 we started to hit him with the brush 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.360
 This is a decoration that will remain 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:04.180
 unicorn but how were you saying that 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.530
 the stencil or extension this existence and 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.319
 we can do it ourselves 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.990
 cutting molds of figures that we 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.930
 like thanks with a pencil I do not know if 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.550
 yes yes yes is hey how nice if we leave it 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.919
 carry what you want to do one so that 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.960
 see and if you lose I would see it 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.409
 another this bigger then this 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.960
 second that is a friend of the woman ok 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.259
 I can use the little flower and the one you 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.259
 want 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.649
 I'm going to make a little flower 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:39.289
 our of the flowers what is what is your 

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:41.179
 favorite figure of frida then from there I 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.799
 The flowers that 

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:44.839
 we can even put them in one color 

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:46.879
 bat in this mode for example right now you 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:48.949
 is greening but after that 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.269
 dry we can use white nothing more 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.129
 for the corners and that's going to give 

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:54.469
 volume to my agriculture the medal table 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.479
 see, I like that combination very much 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.789
 of colors look what is exposed more and 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.009
 what I have decided to see what figure 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:04.489
 I'll give you what you think if we go 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:08.989
 fast to a good cut you see we go 

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:11.589
 we go and we return torito tarde 

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:11.589
 all innocent
