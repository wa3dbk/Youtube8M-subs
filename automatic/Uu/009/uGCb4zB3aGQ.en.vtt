00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.340
 still my hello second recording 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.200
 maybe we'll try less jerky 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.470
 just see a wonderful 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 sunset on kreft de 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 yes my name is rexe that one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.109
 player name and yes I'm watching today 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.710
 the server a few since about 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.710
 just do it 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:45.110
 since almost yes almost a day and I look 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.720
 Of course, I like the whole thing 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.940
 but also decided here on the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.860
 server to stay longer 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.360
 So it's not for me now without it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 himself on another in the forum 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 to draw attention to make the merck 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.480
 server sponsor is good now again 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.790
 a forum but sponsor search or 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.700
 sponsor board yes and the sponsor board 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.530
 I finally have the server 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.750
 description found here 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 or rather the idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.040
 servers and the feelings I actually 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.200
 very good for now nothing against the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.930
 all kids here their minecraft company 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.910
 open 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.340
 that was correctly presented that is 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.340
 one I could blissfully prepare 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.759
 where you actually go now that 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.860
 is what that actually means and 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.750
 just such servers finally zurich 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:49.330
 of course a little thing here 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.330
 to turn so questionable logoff 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.720
 Well, in any case this is mine 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.070
 neighbors and if we go here 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.159
 then we see that the whole thing actually 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.500
 much more such a small flying island 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.259
 is like yes everything reminds me 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.470
 a little bit of final fantasy 4 or something 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.410
 I think a little longer he knows 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.480
 yes in any case you get such 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:24.620
 Islands as assigned as real estate and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.140
 Of course there is still there 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.290
 my neighbor the czech all-round 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 planted how long that is there 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.190
 I do not know 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.760
 yes we we look we go with the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.760
 go on 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.430
 that does not mean business 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.160
 here is some completely own 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.110
 economic system 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.320
 the pricing of what you get 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.810
 powers and etc which is a total 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.590
 leave 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.210
 Ultimately , the offered 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 Demand is the cheapest offer 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:11.120
 Of course, slammed and yes it is 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.680
 Do not stop the true life you could 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.320
 It's almost like comparing stocks 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.790
 In any case, that kind of way turns around 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.130
 a really nice effort 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.130
 Let's write the colleague here 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.200
 get his expertise on this 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.760
 server, we will, as I said to the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.980
 Make a house once 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.659
 I've thought of the nutrients 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.299
 how I will implement the whole thing 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.890
 I would like to have such a stink normal 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.859
 rebuild house 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.860
 with a door over the over redstone 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.690
 rises 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.510
 Of course we will watch the whole thing there 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.700
 can implement time and what for me 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.980
 Of course, too, it is very crucial too 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.650
 say okay, I'll look at it all the time 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.640
 what not to switch with redstone 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:32.410
 and I'm pretty sure 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:33.820
 made this start up here 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.650
 to insist that here 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.370
 to use as a basement so to speak 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.910
 of course, it will be expanded and 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.800
 then we'll see 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.770
 heiko creates 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.180
 as far as I know you have 20 years old and 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.760
 that makes the matter all the more so 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.460
 more interesting that is nothing to do with children 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.120
 the children play in this play 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.620
 is one of them 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.000
 then we have to give them that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.000
 but that's the way it is 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.140
 that's just how it is and before I get here 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.300
 further on, I think I'll start thinking 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.220
 very easy on here for everything 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.520
 build there still needs a bit 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.650
 forces and mine and mine 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.490
 think so 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.980
 no later than when I just above the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.450
 I'll see everything then 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.140
 It will be a bit 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.140
 last 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.840
 and yes, thank you for watching 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:41.470
 and I would be happy if you just 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:46.550
 would stop by yes as I said 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.630
 on gecko gras de and yes and if you 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.310
 You are welcome to ask me questions 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.450
 write in the forum on gecko treff.de 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.040
 there I am reachable under 687 or 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.720
 but also on server sponsor not come 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.980
 and then, of course, if you look like that 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.419
 it continues here I thank you for 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.470
 listen and watch 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:12.110
 and yes the first video let's play 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:15.130
 minecraft only produces almost as well as we do 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.130
 will have us again
