00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I get a lot of questions from science

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.150 
I get a lot of questions from science
teachers<00:00:04.080> they<00:00:04.259> want<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.650> real<00:00:04.859> simple

teachers they want a real simple

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.499 
teachers they want a real simple
experiment<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.060> they<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.299> show<00:00:06.480> their

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
experiment that they can show their

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.839 
experiment that they can show their
students<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.830> one<00:00:08.069> works<00:00:08.309> everywhere

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
students and this one works everywhere

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.730 
students and this one works everywhere
from<00:00:09.120> little<00:00:09.750> kids<00:00:09.960> all<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> way<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.710> to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
from little kids all the way up to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.400 
from little kids all the way up to
college<00:00:11.309> professor<00:00:12.030> type<00:00:12.509> teaching<00:00:12.900> stuff<00:00:13.110> so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
college professor type teaching stuff so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.359 
college professor type teaching stuff so
all<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.280> need<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.360> 500<00:00:15.929> milliliter<00:00:16.379> Pyrex

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
all you need is a 500 milliliter Pyrex

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
all you need is a 500 milliliter Pyrex
container<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.619> you<00:00:19.619> fill<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
container like this one and you fill it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.410 
container like this one and you fill it
with<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.340> clear<00:00:20.580> water<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.119> probably

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
with really clear water you probably

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.939 
with really clear water you probably
have<00:00:21.570> tons<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.140> all<00:00:22.350> around<00:00:22.619> your<00:00:22.740> lab

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
have tons of these all around your lab

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
have tons of these all around your lab
and<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.760> ask<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.150> students

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and what you do is you ask your students

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
and what you do is you ask your students
if<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.010> start<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> fire<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.119> now

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
if they can start a fire with this now

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
if they can start a fire with this now
it's<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.410> easier<00:00:28.439> than<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's a lot easier than you think and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.659 
it's a lot easier than you think and
most<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.750> will<00:00:30.900> probably<00:00:31.439> try<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> come

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
most of them will probably try to come

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.440 
most of them will probably try to come
up<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> whole<00:00:32.969> bunch<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.390> different

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
up with a whole bunch of different

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.970 
up with a whole bunch of different
things<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> rules<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.829> only

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
things and the rules are you can only

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
things and the rules are you can only
use<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.700> can't<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.780> hydrogen<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
use this you can't make hydrogen out of

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
use this you can't make hydrogen out of
it<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> can't<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.160> anything<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.760> just

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it you can't do anything you just just

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
it you can't do anything you just just
use<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> show<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> how

use this now I'm going to show you how

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.020 
use this now I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:44.030> got
