00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.570 
underneath that and the whole 3d look
comes<00:02:24.210> from<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> red<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> blue<00:02:25.580> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
comes from the red and the blue that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.020 
comes from the red and the blue that
turns<00:02:27.210> into<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> gray<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> um<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.430> pretty

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
turns into the gray and um just pretty

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.270 
turns into the gray and um just pretty
much<00:02:30.210> stands<00:02:30.600> out<00:02:30.900> from<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.890> gives<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
much stands out from there and gives it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
much stands out from there and gives it
that<00:02:32.310> 3d<00:02:32.880> look<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> way<00:02:34.080> it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that 3d look so it's just the way it's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.790 
that 3d look so it's just the way it's
layered<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:35.030> guess<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.330> three<00:02:36.570> colors

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
layered I guess with the three colors

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.710 
layered I guess with the three colors
that<00:02:37.800> gives<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> pop<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.820> effect<00:02:39.240> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that gives it that pop out effect that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.160 
that gives it that pop out effect that
3d<00:02:40.140> look<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:42.000> right<00:02:42.210> one<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.720> pretty<00:02:42.960> much

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
3d look the right one was pretty much

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.070 
3d look the right one was pretty much
the<00:02:43.350> same<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.160> opposite<00:02:44.700> all<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.720> so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the same just the opposite all right so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.650 
the same just the opposite all right so
where<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> red<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.610> here<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.090> blue<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.450> on
