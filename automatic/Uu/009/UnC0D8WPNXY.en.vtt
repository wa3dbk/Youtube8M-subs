core temp says 1.25 I when I was in vice
I<00:01:06.729> set<00:01:06.939> it<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.180> 1<00:01:07.780> point<00:01:08.080> 3<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:09.159> 5<00:01:09.549> so<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:11.159> kind

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
I set it to 1 point 3 to 5 so it's kind

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.200 
I set it to 1 point 3 to 5 so it's kind
of<00:01:12.250> similar<00:01:13.000> between<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.630> old<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.220> yes<00:01:15.220> for

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
him for that point 18 I did a Oct T test

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.880 
him for that point 18 I did a Oct T test
and<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.439> was<00:01:21.090> 6<00:01:22.090> hours<00:01:22.329> when<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.869> was<00:01:23.020> sleep<00:01:23.320> for

and it was 6 hours when I was sleep for
load<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:25.090> held<00:01:25.510> out<00:01:25.659> all<00:01:25.960> those<00:01:26.140> six<00:01:26.440> hours<00:01:26.740> so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
load it held out all those six hours so

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.710 
load it held out all those six hours so
it's<00:01:27.400> kind<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.700> stable<00:01:28.060> overclock<00:01:29.670> here

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's kind of a stable overclock here

it's kind of a stable overclock here
temperatures<00:01:31.750> 39:37<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:33.340> degrees<00:01:34.000> celsius

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
temperatures 39:37 so degrees celsius

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
program running for a minute so 37 but

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.520 
program running for a minute so 37 but
like<00:01:41.620> 41<00:01:42.550> 40<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.240> maximum<00:01:43.810> i've<00:01:43.990> seen<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
like 41 40 is the maximum i've seen and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.610 
like 41 40 is the maximum i've seen and
just<00:01:44.740> sitting<00:01:45.340> we're<00:01:45.670> just<00:01:46.210> working<00:01:46.930> nothing

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
cpu on 34 degrees celsius 3937 according

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
cpu on 34 degrees celsius 3937 according
to<00:01:54.729> speed<00:01:55.510> fan<00:01:55.690> as<00:01:55.840> well<00:01:56.700> core<00:01:57.700> temps<00:01:57.970> has<00:01:58.090> also

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to speed fan as well core temps has also

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.940 
to speed fan as well core temps has also
3937<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.040> yeah<00:02:00.820> real<00:02:01.030> temp<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.360> sorcerer<00:02:01.950> 937

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
3937 and yeah real temp you sorcerer 937

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.630 
3937 and yeah real temp you sorcerer 937
so<00:02:03.159> it's<00:02:03.400> probably<00:02:04.350> kind<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.470> right<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:05.950> yeah

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
so it's probably kind of right so yeah

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.340 
so it's probably kind of right so yeah
that's<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.920> overclock<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.099> me<00:02:09.190> guys
