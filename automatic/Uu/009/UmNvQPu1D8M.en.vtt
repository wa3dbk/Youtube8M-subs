00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
all in the right hand let's take a look

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.260 
all in the right hand let's take a look
at<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:00.970> now<00:01:02.460> everything<00:01:03.460> here<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.730> happening

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
at that now everything here is happening

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.420 
at that now everything here is happening
in<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.480> right<00:01:04.690> hand<00:01:05.020> we<00:01:05.770> have<00:01:05.980> a<00:01:06.010> typical

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
in the right hand we have a typical

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.760 
in the right hand we have a typical
alternating<00:01:07.150> bass<00:01:07.330> sounds<00:01:07.960> like<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.650> are

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
alternating bass sounds like this we are

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.640 
alternating bass sounds like this we are
actually<00:01:14.950> going<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.370> start<00:01:15.850> with<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:17.020> open<00:01:17.410> g

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
actually going to start with the open g

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.560 
actually going to start with the open g
string<00:01:17.680> which<00:01:18.160> is<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.370> last<00:01:18.790> note<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.450> our

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
string which is the last note in our

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.140 
string which is the last note in our
pattern<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.710> reason<00:01:20.980> that<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.340> because<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
pattern the reason that is is because it

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.330 
pattern the reason that is is because it
makes<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.630> lot<00:01:22.840> easier<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:23.590> get<00:01:23.800> into<00:01:24.010> that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
makes it a lot easier to get into that

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.100 
makes it a lot easier to get into that
role<00:01:24.670> when<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.630> first<00:01:25.840> note

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
role when you have that first note

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.800 
role when you have that first note
starting<00:01:26.620> once<00:01:27.580> again<00:01:27.910> one<00:01:28.270> finger<00:01:28.630> per

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
starting once again one finger per

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.930 
starting once again one finger per
string<00:01:29.110> first<00:01:29.560> finger<00:01:29.800> always<00:01:30.130> plays<00:01:30.610> g

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
string first finger always plays g

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.170 
string first finger always plays g
middle<00:01:31.930> finger<00:01:32.200> always<00:01:32.380> plays<00:01:32.740> B<00:01:33.040> ring<00:01:33.820> finger

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
middle finger always plays B ring finger

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.410 
middle finger always plays B ring finger
always<00:01:34.450> plays<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.350> high<00:01:35.530> E<00:01:35.560> string<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:37.300> we

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
always plays the high E string so we

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.570 
always plays the high E string so we
start<00:01:37.810> with<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.350> open<00:01:38.619> G<00:01:39.210> player<00:01:40.210> boom<00:01:41.580> then

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
start with the open G player boom then

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.880 
start with the open G player boom then
we<00:01:42.790> do<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> roll<00:01:43.450> pattern<00:01:44.050> with<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.650> middle

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
we do a roll pattern with the middle

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.609 
we do a roll pattern with the middle
finger<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.400> B<00:01:45.550> string<00:01:46.260> first<00:01:47.260> finger<00:01:47.410> on

finger on the B string first finger on

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.340 
finger on the B string first finger on
the<00:01:47.680> G<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.820> finally<00:01:49.210> our<00:01:50.610> chick<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:52.990> sounds

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the G and finally our chick so it sounds

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.000 
the G and finally our chick so it sounds
like<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:53.710> those<00:01:53.950> notes

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.060 

we<00:02:00.010> then<00:02:00.280> play<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.940> alternating<00:02:01.450> bass<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
we then play the alternating bass and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
but with a high E string you really have

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.750 
but with a high E string you really have
to<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.300> with<00:03:07.450> your<00:03:07.570> thumb<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.050> get<00:03:08.200> it
