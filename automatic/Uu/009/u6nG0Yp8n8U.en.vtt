00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.970
 happy face is a group of dances 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.180
 approximately in 2007 they integrate 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 several people from approximately between 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.180
 16 and 23 years old almost the majority are pure 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.339
 straight dancers we danced in the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.199
 street because most of the time not 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:01:04.580
 there are places to dance and we have to 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:01:06.560
 adapt ourselves to the media that does not 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.810
 my name is that they are giovanni and they are caritas 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.750
 and I am 25 years old for me happy 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.090
 face is my club and it is my family with the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.299
 What more time a baby spends is a 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.860
 person who practices breakdance the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.180
 adrenaline that you feel at the time of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.700
 the battles when they are in the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.070
 contests or satisfactions that we say 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.229
 almost not because I ended up very tired very 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.920
 sore but the present chilo to the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.920
 time to do it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 and dancing are the stations that you feel 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.190
 in the body when you listen to the music and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.400
 it is very enjoyable to do it is a movement 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.079
 it is addictive actually dancing 6 years 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 and they keep looking at other people 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.140
 practice is also a lot of attention 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.540
 dancing has many substitutions like 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.659
 concertistas holds a lot 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.659
 for health you have fun content
