00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 I will have quite a short one today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.330
 video and in fact this is not a review to me 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.200
 answer to the question of my viewer in PM 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 regarding the quality of the stones which 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.150
 recently began to produce Ukrainian 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.279
 producer and so here is a stone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.189
 Ukrainian production of grain 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.710
 1014 microns claimed by the manufacturer 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.920
 grit means a stone of this size 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.100
 that is, 20 by 7 centimeters cost me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 in 15 dollars agree it is beautiful 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.309
 the price is super when I saw it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 offer in the market I was very happy 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.309
 immediately ordered but cheap shell cheese 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 happens only in a mousetrap 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.149
 unfortunately I donâ€™t have a knife 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 which need to be sharpened 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.930
 so it would be necessary to sharpen so I 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 just show how this stone works 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 does that mean carbide stone 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 silicon see stone soaks up 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 pretty good water that is soak 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.770
 it needs decently the bubbles go sizzle 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:27.350
 everything is as it should be but here we start 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:31.140
 just a finger to drive and you see yes how 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.750
 powder dye that is in my 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.759
 the look is to put it mildly not good 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.259
 however it would seem that this should be talking about 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.720
 the fact that the stone will shoot well 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 metal we will build navlya and suits so on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:59.000
 well let's try what we see on my 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.000
 look at my 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 the speed of work to say the least leaves 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.650
 want better with this note 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.040
 it is very often use very soft 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:25.790
 to become. plasticine here 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.989
 the response of a normal sensation is practically 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.110
 no, that is, to give the feeling that only 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.110
 sent because you can sharpen too 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.150
 that is to say the stone somehow works something he 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.730
 does but say it works well 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.660
 I can not for one simple reason even 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.209
 considering the price 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.030
 because if we take this 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.030
 good too Ukrainian production 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.370
 though a little bit more expensive but this stone 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.590
 there are difficulties up in these stones i 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.109
 I'll tell you later here is a Ukrainian stone 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:29.230
 production grain is the same 14 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:29.230
 micro so it works quite differently 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.670
 look how he removes metal 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:04:01.550
 you see it is even a pleasure to work so to 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.959
 unfortunately unfortunately this stone is me 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.970
 disappointed me for him no at all 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.470
 no use ie it is real 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:16.419
 I have a ballast where to put it 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.870
 change it to someone or sell it to me 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:24.710
 conscience does not allow yes because well 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:31.880
 slip a man something known 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:36.500
 bad I do not want in my opinion 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:40.190
 Stone of such size silicon carbide 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.820
 You see, you see, and you shoot 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:53.860
 itself something general but not removed 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:53.860
 The first speed does not suit the second 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:02.530
 it's hard to explain maybe i just 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.979
 I don't like the ceramic bundle 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.979
 Well, somehow 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.180
 perry pleasant sensations 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.650
 the island is running wacom just create 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.510
 here is a stone give the same good 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.300
 stone yes it is pleasant to grind 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.860
 you get pleasure here on this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:39.350
 Sorry there was a feeling that you were going 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:43.340
 on asphalt so this is to me i wouldn't 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:50.750
 I recommend that you take though the price from them 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:52.730
 very tempting characteristics then 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.200
 You know, while you are cooking everything on your passport 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.860
 well and in the work here did not work out 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.860
 Thank you for watching
