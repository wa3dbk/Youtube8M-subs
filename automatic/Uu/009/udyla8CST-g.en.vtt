00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the launch of the xperia m4 water shows 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 a change in the behavior of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
 companies that are now looking for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 launch handsets on the same line in less 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 one year 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.139
 the previous ex-pm 2 aqua was released in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.400
 September last year and now we have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 a new model 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 in this case as well as e3 I think it was 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 necessary because they were appliances in a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 highly competitive market and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 they sinned in many matters 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 We already talked about the present improvements. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.410
 in xperia 4 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.510
 but will 4 bring me news 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.809
 that justify the price of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.370
 1,500 reais of face it is possible to notice the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.700
 similar to the top of the brand 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.770
 c3 without picking it up is very difficult to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 distinguish one from another but as soon as 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.789
 You start to touch it. You can notice the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 The first difference is the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 plastic 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 the resemblance is not bad for me and 4 that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 now it seems a cell phone much better 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 finished even though the edges 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.230
 Plastic also it is well built 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 buttons are firm and easy to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.489
 distinguish the difference from one to the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 another without having to look at this design 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 characteristic of sony has a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 weak is ergonomics 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 How big a cell phone is it? 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 completely flat back is not as 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 comfortable on the hand and often looks 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.720
 that will escape 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.820
 the speaker is unfortunately 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 on the bottom of the device and on my 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.909
 opinion stopped wanting a little 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.500
 also power 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.450
 just not being in the front 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.799
 hinders the arrival of sound 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 The problem is that it would be even more 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.829
 similar to c3 if it were located in the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.259
 front 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 still talking about the hardware can 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.369
 that the connections are protected by 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.369
 a small door which makes it the proof 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.780
 up to 30 minutes to one meter and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.570
 half depth 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 The strange dangerous thing is that entrance to the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 charger is exposed 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
 although this will not affect at all is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 care must be taken not to place the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.060
 phone to charge with this part 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 wet 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 it has compatibility with 4g in this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 version I received for testing is possible 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 use two nano sim chips and still 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.229
 expand the internal storage that is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 16 gigabytes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.599
 in the aesthetic part om4 definitely 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 brought significant improvements 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.900
 however creative a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.819
 thing that disappointed me a lot 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.379
 the previous duel was the screen but this 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.659
 instead they decided to make a deal 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.459
 right to increase the size of the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.310
 5 inch screen 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.450
 the resolution also jumped to 1,280 per 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.069
 720 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.340
 you can believe that the previous model 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.140
 It cost a thousand reais and had no HD screen. 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.239
 something that they improved a lot was the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.579
 contrast the quality of the screen 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.319
 now things are much more faithful and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.659
 consequently it is much better to 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.620
 consume media the pixel density 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.459
 jumped from 229 to 294 pixels per 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.989
 inch 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.299
 what was once a weak point of the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.670
 device has now become a strong point 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.799
 many manufacturers were 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.769
 color fidelity of your screens 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.170
 it comes with version 5.0 of android and 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.000
 sony skin brings few changes 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.620
 only that most of them with a language 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.359
 confused design 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.489
 is different from what I killed the design of 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.280
 Google intended some applications 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.260
 were simply adapted from the kat kit 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.220
 without the slightest effort and got a little 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.200
 chilled out 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.269
 their version does not have a problem 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.379
 being heavy but not as pretty as 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.329
 it could be 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.730
 have multiple applications installed 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.889
 many of them can be 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.690
 Uninstalled I am disabled 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.250
 a great example of a small mistake 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.299
 bullshit they did to change the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.430
 middle button 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.870
 if they had left round as the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.819
 android original 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 I will remember even the control of the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.750
 playstation a missed opportunity 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.430
 the processor now snapdragon 615 that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.010
 in theory offers optimum performance 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.579
 because of its eight nuclei looked at 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.579
 2gb memory in practice I realized 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.379
 some delays in responding to the slowness 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.569
 time to open some apps 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.400
 He did not turn up as fast as I did. 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.290
 especially with these 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.909
 specifications capable of providing a 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.639
 good experience 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.040
 on the other hand, the greno adreno 405 is capable 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.930
 even heavy games with 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.790
 some frame breaks but not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.500
 prevent them from taking advantage of the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.829
 available at the playstation store 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.989
 the battery of 2400m attachment does not 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.449
 disappointed in performance and ensure a 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.609
 calm day of intense use and even 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.279
 two full days of light use 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.349
 I did not test with the internet 4g but I imagine 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.730
 that the impact should not be so great 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.440
 the average time 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.030
 with the screen attached to a battery was 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.140
 four and a half hours , which in my 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.180
 opinion is good 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.860
 sony drew attention to the camera 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.260
 device that went from 8 to 3 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.420
 megapixels and the front that now counts 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.040
 with a 5 megapixel sensor 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.260
 I noticed that the camera application a 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.970
 little slow to open sometimes 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.640
 interface has not changed much of the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.680
 previous offering some options 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.960
 I ended up getting interested not to notice 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.820
 much difference in some cases the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.830
 overall performance left a little 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.570
 you want because both the front camera 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.100
 against the rear is a bit 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.230
 unpredictable in my opinion 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.760
 sometimes you try hard to get a 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.340
 photo with a good layout and not 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.590
 can and at other times it comes out perfect 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.080
 without much effort has a device with less 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.180
 megapixels and better results 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.310
 companies need to stop selling 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.680
 this number as if it were nonino of 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.690
 Record quality on the water also showed 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.520
 be a challenge because many times the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.520
 recording because the water has the same 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.650
 effect of finger touch on the screen is enough 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.570
 implement some functionality that only 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.070
 for recording with the physical button on the 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.340
 simple camera 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.650
 the ex-pm 4 water is a much better solar 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.910
 than the previous but for the price still a 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.560
 expensive cell phone 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.720
 it can now be considered a 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.730
 good cell phone only the fact 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.960
 it's waterproof makes it worth it. 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.700
 pay more 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.860
 if you really want it on your phone for 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.610
 can lead to water and do not want to pay 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.100
 very 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.680
 this is undoubtedly the most 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.120
 but if you do not mind this maybe 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.940
 it's better to look for one with a 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.530
 better and cheaper performance if 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.570
 sign up for beta shows to watch 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.310
 all videos first hand and also 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.850
 like in this video if you liked 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.510
 his 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.510
 thanks
