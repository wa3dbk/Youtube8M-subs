00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.330
 for a while it will teach us how to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.639
 integrated into your computers first 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.669
 what they have to do is connect their 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.099
 cellular by usb you had an android and 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.450
 use it I use the anchor option for 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.619
 usb 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.800
 two programs only the native option of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.670
 dogs can download or use it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.120
 wifi spot 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:34.310
 that is connected to a program 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.310
 is sending network to the computer 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 and you have to send them to the page 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 telcel very well here appears down here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.740
 and here it is and he says he is not using 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.000
 those things 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.900
 good 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 but not 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 you have to open it 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.010
 It is not a fault because we operate 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 and now the program detects that in the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 net 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 and copy everything as I have it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.530
 mark only these three options in the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.530
 Port 88 88 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.860
 then you already know the trick 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.730
 type of the host proposes 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.730
 goes next to mx the question mark 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.970
 here add the portet to third point 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.970
 mobile and port 80 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 and to the rest they leave it as it is 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.229
 now 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.560
 they will right click on the program 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.560
 ipse 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 in a loved one 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.510
 they are going to mark mcquaid 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.010
 from this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.010
 Now what they have to do is open 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.079
 perforated 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.079
 ultrasur 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.210
 and already connected to the server but 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.100
 I'm going to put the configuration 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.720
 how do you see disconnected the network 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.070
 Let's see 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.070
 well let's go 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.739
 the option 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.019
 they mark everything as I have it here 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.960
 I'll change then 80 80 I do not know if I have something 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.220
 what to see but it's not working 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:37.120
 the next set and they're going to put this 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 127,000 point 1 and the port 88 88 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.740
 I'm already connected now we're going to 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.740
 to work 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.370
 that as they charge only where there is 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.740
 much sign why it takes to load the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.740
 pages but it works very fast 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.430
 and it works to watch video 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.570
 therefore 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.570
 or 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.410
 the facebook works also to the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.410
 perfection 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.849
 good would be everything if some doubt only 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.280
 they say and if they want to contribute how to increase 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.860
 Wheat speed gladly 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.210
 I receive it 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.210
 it would be all thanks
