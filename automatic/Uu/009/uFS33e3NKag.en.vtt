00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
okay so here we are in the vehicle we're

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.260 
okay so here we are in the vehicle we're
gonna<00:00:07.229> diagnose<00:00:07.799> any<00:00:08.100> fault<00:00:08.459> codes<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.059> may

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
gonna diagnose any fault codes that may

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.509 
gonna diagnose any fault codes that may
be<00:00:09.480> occurring<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.290> also<00:00:10.770> clear<00:00:11.070> any<00:00:11.280> fault

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
be occurring and also clear any fault

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.189 
be occurring and also clear any fault
codes<00:00:11.789> using<00:00:12.029> the<00:00:12.299> hotel<00:00:13.430> gs500<00:00:14.430> obd2<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.869> yo

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
codes using the hotel gs500 obd2 and yo

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.530 
codes using the hotel gs500 obd2 and yo
we<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:17.300> scan<00:00:18.300> tool<00:00:18.800> glasses<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> Mac<00:00:20.130> scan<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
we do scan tool glasses a Mac scan it

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.540 
we do scan tool glasses a Mac scan it
will<00:00:21.750> work<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.230> any<00:00:22.410> petrol<00:00:22.890> vehicle<00:00:23.310> from

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
will work with any petrol vehicle from

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.680 
will work with any petrol vehicle from
2001<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.170> then<00:00:25.470> he<00:00:25.560> diesel<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.950> vehicle<00:00:26.340> from

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
2001 and then he diesel a vehicle from

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.220 
2001 and then he diesel a vehicle from
2004<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.480> vehicle<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.020> it's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
2004 so we're in the vehicle now it's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.350 
2004 so we're in the vehicle now it's
plugged<00:00:31.500> into<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.860> 16<00:00:32.309> pin<00:00:32.579> diagnostic<00:00:33.180> port

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
plugged into the 16 pin diagnostic port

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.950 
plugged into the 16 pin diagnostic port
the<00:00:33.600> ignition<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.860> clicks<00:00:35.839> and<00:00:36.839> we're

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the ignition is on two clicks and we're

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.360 
the ignition is on two clicks and we're
going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.109> go<00:00:37.230> into<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> diagnostic<00:00:38.069> menu

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
going to go into the diagnostic menu

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
going to go into the diagnostic menu
here<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> doing<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.780> searching

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
here what it's doing now is searching

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
here what it's doing now is searching
through<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:40.920> many<00:00:41.269> diagnostic<00:00:42.269> protocols

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
through the many diagnostic protocols

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
through the many diagnostic protocols
within<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> vehicle<00:00:43.609> looking<00:00:44.609> for<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
within the vehicle looking for a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.239 
within the vehicle looking for a
protocol<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.569> I<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.960> connect<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
protocol that I can connect with so that

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:54.410 
protocol that I can connect with so that
I<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.640> read<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:47.940> clear<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> fault<00:00:48.870> codes<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I can read and clear the fault codes and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
I can read and clear the fault codes and
here<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.679> little<00:00:55.769> bit<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
here we have just a little bit of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.079 
here we have just a little bit of
information<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.639> tell<00:00:56.819> you<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.149> found

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
information to tell you what it's found

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.939 
information to tell you what it's found
so<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.239> mill<00:01:00.420> state<00:01:00.749> this<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.709> on<00:01:03.949> code

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
so the mill state this here is on code

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.010 
so the mill state this here is on code
found<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.799> we'll<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.990> will

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
found one so what we'll do is we will

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
found one so what we'll do is we will
try<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.469> diagnose<00:01:11.009> that<00:01:11.310> fault<00:01:13.009> see<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
try and diagnose that fault see what it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.660 
try and diagnose that fault see what it
is<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.880> asks<00:01:15.030> us<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> read<00:01:15.750> codes<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is so it asks us to read codes so I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
is so it asks us to read codes so I
think<00:01:17.880> yes<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.920> I'm<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.070> click<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
think yes to that I'm gonna click on the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.060 
think yes to that I'm gonna click on the
stored<00:01:20.820> codes<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.119> engine

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
stored codes for the engine

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
stored codes for the engine
reading<00:01:26.070> codes<00:01:26.359> so<00:01:27.359> it's<00:01:27.509> telling<00:01:27.689> us<00:01:27.960> there

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
reading codes so it's telling us there

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.179 
reading codes so it's telling us there
that<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:29.689> heater<00:01:30.689> control<00:01:31.229> circuit<00:01:31.680> bank<00:01:31.979> 1

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that the heater control circuit bank 1

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.599 
that the heater control circuit bank 1
sensor<00:01:32.219> is<00:01:33.149> faulty<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.130> produces<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
sensor is faulty and that produces a

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.490 
sensor is faulty and that produces a
cold<00:01:35.909> p<00:01:36.240> 0<00:01:36.719> 0<00:01:36.810> 3<00:01:37.530> 6<00:01:38.329> now<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.780> find<00:01:40.170> more

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
cold p 0 0 3 6 now you can find more

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.160 
cold p 0 0 3 6 now you can find more
information<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> code<00:01:41.820> means

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
information about what that code means

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.029 
information about what that code means
online<00:01:43.219> and<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.549> tell<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> exactly<00:01:46.039> what

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
online and it will tell you exactly what

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.800 
online and it will tell you exactly what
the<00:01:47.159> problem<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.609> so<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.829> want<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.219> now

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
the problem is so what we want to do now

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.459 
the problem is so what we want to do now
is<00:01:52.820> arrays<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> code<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> let's<00:01:58.049> assume<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
is arrays the code so let's assume that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
is arrays the code so let's assume that
we've<00:01:58.679> actually<00:01:58.890> fixed<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> sensor<00:01:59.999> or<00:02:00.119> fix

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
we've actually fixed the sensor or fix

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
we've actually fixed the sensor or fix
the<00:02:00.479> problem<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.020> occurring<00:02:01.549> are<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the problem that is occurring are you

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.440 
the problem that is occurring are you
sure<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.749> wish<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.140> erase<00:02:04.439> trouble<00:02:05.039> codes<00:02:05.450> I'm

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
sure you wish to erase trouble codes I'm

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.309 
sure you wish to erase trouble codes I'm
gonna<00:02:06.780> click<00:02:07.109> yes<00:02:08.929> ok<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.080> done

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
gonna click yes ok it's done

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.710 
gonna click yes ok it's done
there<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.820> what<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.570> we'll

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
there we go so what we do now is we'll

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.900 
there we go so what we do now is we'll
go<00:02:12.810> back<00:02:13.020> into<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.410> reading<00:02:13.770> codes<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
go back into the reading codes and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.670 
go back into the reading codes and
just<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.540> make<00:02:16.690> sure<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.320> has<00:02:17.470> been

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
just to make sure that it has been

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.270 
just to make sure that it has been
cleared<00:02:19.110> no<00:02:20.110> codes<00:02:20.470> are<00:02:20.590> stolen<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> module

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
cleared no codes are stolen the module

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.310 
cleared no codes are stolen the module
there<00:02:21.520> we<00:02:21.610> go<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.270> Mac<00:02:22.510> scan<00:02:22.840> has

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
there we go so the Mac scan has

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.020 
there we go so the Mac scan has
successfully<00:02:25.230> read<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> cleared<00:02:27.250> fault

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
successfully read and cleared fault

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.770 
successfully read and cleared fault
codes<00:02:29.130> for<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.250> particular<00:02:30.520> vehicle<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.750> a
