00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so that you can access your good linkage

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
so that you can access your good linkage
for<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.700> door<00:01:20.880> handle<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.390> you'll<00:01:21.509> have

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.660 

pretty<00:01:25.710> straightforward<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
pretty straightforward there's a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.300 
pretty straightforward there's a
regulator<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.220> window<00:01:29.220> motor<00:01:34.280> about<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
regulator for the window motor about a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
regulator for the window motor about a
half-hour<00:01:35.729> job<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> change<00:01:36.869> your

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
half-hour job you got to change your

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
half-hour job you got to change your
window<00:01:37.259> motor<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.130> getting<00:01:38.430> into<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
window motor I'm not getting into that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
window motor I'm not getting into that
today<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> window<00:01:40.020> actually<00:01:40.200> works

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
today because the window actually works

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
today because the window actually works
fine<00:01:40.860> typical<00:01:41.670> GM<00:01:41.970> windows<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> goes<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.930> slow

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
fine typical GM windows it goes up slow

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
fine typical GM windows it goes up slow
but<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.710> still<00:01:43.979> works<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.780> don't<00:01:45.780> need<00:01:45.869> any

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but it still works so I don't need any

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.850 
but it still works so I don't need any
window<00:01:46.380> mortar<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.740> any<00:01:46.920> means<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.770> when<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
window mortar by any means but when the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.410 
window mortar by any means but when the
motors<00:01:50.159> over<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:52.399> there's<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:54.149> also

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
motors over there there's it's also

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
motors over there there's it's also
riveted<00:01:54.990> into

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
riveted into

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.149 
riveted into
that's<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.299> different<00:01:58.600> video<00:01:58.719> if<00:01:59.590> when<00:02:00.070> the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
that's a different video if when the

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.539 
that's a different video if when the
motor<00:02:00.369> ever<00:02:00.549> goes<00:02:00.789> on<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.180> Oneg<00:02:01.420> video<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:02.549> ok

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
motor ever goes on the Oneg video on ok

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.969 
motor ever goes on the Oneg video on ok
with<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> plate<00:02:04.090> removed<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.719> can<00:02:04.750> see<00:02:04.979> two

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
with the plate removed you can see two

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.460 
with the plate removed you can see two
nuts<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.460> are<00:02:06.520> holding<00:02:06.789> it<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.149> there<00:02:07.440> need<00:02:08.440> a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
nuts that are holding it in there need a

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.300 
nuts that are holding it in there need a
small<00:02:08.800> ratchet<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.560> pain<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.920> ass<00:02:12.099> to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
small ratchet it's a pain in the ass to

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.290 
small ratchet it's a pain in the ass to
do<00:02:12.459> you're<00:02:12.790> going<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.940> have<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.970> scratch

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
do you're going to have you just scratch

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.940 
do you're going to have you just scratch
a<00:02:16.420> couple<00:02:16.660> layers<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.989> skin<00:02:17.140> off<00:02:17.319> more<00:02:17.560> likely

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
a couple layers of skin off more likely

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.530 
a couple layers of skin off more likely
getting<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.310> there<00:02:19.140> right<00:02:20.140> there<00:02:21.480> there's<00:02:22.480> a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
getting in there right there there's a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.960 
getting in there right there there's a
little<00:02:22.810> clip<00:02:23.190> holding<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.340> linkage<00:02:24.760> on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
little clip holding that linkage on

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.350 
little clip holding that linkage on
there<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.599> never<00:02:25.750> slips<00:02:26.200> off<00:02:26.440> there<00:02:27.360> you'll

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
there so it never slips off there you'll

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.530 
there so it never slips off there you'll
have<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.660> bend<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.959> clip<00:02:29.349> up<00:02:30.060> towards<00:02:31.060> toward

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
have to bend that clip up towards toward

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.069 
have to bend that clip up towards toward
left<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:33.160> order<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.700> remove<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.540> linkage<00:02:34.840> rod

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
left in order to remove the linkage rod

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.390 
left in order to remove the linkage rod
it<00:02:36.010> save<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.459> guys<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> little<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.239> time
