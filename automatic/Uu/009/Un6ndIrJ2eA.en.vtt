00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
put this in fast motion we go i SAT here

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.550 
put this in fast motion we go i SAT here
for<00:02:56.430> about<00:02:56.580> three<00:02:56.970> minutes<00:02:57.060> doing<00:02:57.360> this<00:03:00.560> now

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
for about three minutes doing this now

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.400 
for about three minutes doing this now
there<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.800> go<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.430> gone<00:03:02.580> up<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.760> little<00:03:02.940> bit

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
there we go it's gone up a little bit

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.720 
there we go it's gone up a little bit
they<00:03:04.410> might<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.860> best<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:05.280> it's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
they might not be the best way but it's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.770 
they might not be the best way but it's
gone<00:03:05.880> up<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.300> it's<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.540> pass<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.390> now<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> very

same<00:03:22.380> no<00:03:23.220> difference<00:03:23.580> let's<00:03:24.060> try<00:03:24.150> again<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.600> lot

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
same no difference let's try again a lot

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.410 
same no difference let's try again a lot
well<00:03:25.650> violently<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.590> 103<00:03:29.160> shaking<00:03:30.000> doesn't

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
well violently and 103 shaking doesn't

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.670 
well violently and 103 shaking doesn't
work<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:31.350> fail<00:03:34.880> next<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.030> bike<00:03:36.600> wheel<00:03:36.840> I've

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
work you fail next one bike wheel I've

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320 
work you fail next one bike wheel I've
got<00:03:37.860> high<00:03:37.980> hopes<00:03:38.010> for<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.820> similar

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
got high hopes for this one is similar

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.630 
got high hopes for this one is similar
to<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> fan<00:03:39.770> but<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> lot<00:03:40.980> faster<00:03:41.130> let's<00:03:41.790> go

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.510 

good<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:47.569> far<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.810> think<00:03:48.010> well<00:03:49.010> it's<00:03:49.220> not<00:03:49.310> having

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
good so far I think well it's not having

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.110 
good so far I think well it's not having
a<00:03:49.550> lot<00:03:49.640> of<00:03:49.700> movement<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.210> right<00:03:50.510> at<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.690> wheel

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
a lot of movement is right at the wheel

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.960 
a lot of movement is right at the wheel
fresh<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.240> be<00:03:53.330> on<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> side

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.060 

let<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> spin<00:04:03.870> from<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.230> get<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.830> maximum

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
let it spin from it get the maximum

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.380 
let it spin from it get the maximum
chance<00:04:05.430> speed<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.030> little<00:04:06.150> bit<00:04:06.240> more<00:04:06.480> I

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
chance speed it up a little bit more I

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:17.020 
chance speed it up a little bit more I
put<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.480> brake<00:04:09.660> on<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.990> this<00:04:10.080> happened<00:04:13.460> yep

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.400 

119<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.390> gone<00:04:18.510> up<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.690> bit<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.140> gone<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.290> a

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
119 so it's gone up a bit it's gone up a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.920 
119 so it's gone up a bit it's gone up a
bit<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.310> that'll<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> pass<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.720> going

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
bit so that'll be a pass now just going

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.740 
bit so that'll be a pass now just going
for<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.110> walk<00:04:26.420> obviously<00:04:27.420> it's<00:04:27.540> what<00:04:27.660> it's

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
for a walk obviously it's what it's

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.339 
for a walk obviously it's what it's
designed<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> let's<00:04:29.880> try<00:04:30.030> it

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.679 

so<00:04:35.349> five<00:04:35.679> minutes<00:04:35.919> later<00:04:37.799> there<00:04:38.799> it<00:04:38.889> is<00:04:39.689> and

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
so five minutes later there it is and

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.749 
so five minutes later there it is and
we've<00:04:40.839> had<00:04:40.959> a<00:04:40.989> big<00:04:41.199> increase<00:04:44.339> yeah<00:04:45.339> look<00:04:45.639> at

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
we've had a big increase yeah look at

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.589 
we've had a big increase yeah look at
that<00:04:47.069> so<00:04:48.069> I<00:04:48.099> can<00:04:48.369> say<00:04:48.399> walking<00:04:49.239> is<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.479> best

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
that so I can say walking is the best

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.299 
that so I can say walking is the best
method<00:04:49.749> unless<00:04:50.709> you<00:04:50.889> want<00:04:51.069> to<00:04:51.129> build<00:04:51.279> my

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:51.309 
method unless you want to build my

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.919 
method unless you want to build my
contraption<00:04:51.909> which<00:04:52.119> I<00:04:52.269> still<00:04:52.509> think<00:04:52.689> the<00:04:52.749> best

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:52.929 
contraption which I still think the best

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:56.429 
contraption which I still think the best
actually<00:04:53.279> so<00:04:54.279> yes<00:04:54.459> epic<00:04:54.849> pass<00:04:55.199> now<00:04:56.199> there<00:04:56.349> were

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
actually so yes epic pass now there were

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.409 
actually so yes epic pass now there were
some<00:04:56.649> more<00:04:56.799> suggestions<00:04:57.399> which<00:04:57.789> I<00:04:57.909> can't<00:04:58.209> put

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
some more suggestions which I can't put
