from<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> mother<00:00:21.689> plant<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.890> by

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
from the mother plant we do that by

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.509 
from the mother plant we do that by
cutting<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:24.300> below<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.529> ball<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> moss<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
cutting just below the ball of moss you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
cutting just below the ball of moss you
want<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> nice<00:00:27.119> sharp<00:00:27.869> knife<00:00:27.900> or

air<00:00:39.480> layering<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> difficult<00:00:40.800> process<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
air layering is a difficult process and

Moss ball dried out in some cases I
found<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.090> plant<00:00:54.530> produced<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.710> great

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
found that the plant produced a great

amount of callus tissue and just really

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
amount of callus tissue and just really
started<00:00:59.489> sealing<00:01:00.449> over<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> wound<00:01:01.289> site<00:01:01.710> you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and keep the bag over the plant for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.500 
and keep the bag over the plant for
about<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> week<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> week<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.130> half<00:02:21.510> after

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
about a week or a week and a half after

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.080 
about a week or a week and a half after
about<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.960> week<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:24.160> ahead<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.520> start<00:02:24.820> cutting

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
about a week go ahead and start cutting

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.540 
about a week go ahead and start cutting
little<00:02:25.420> holes<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.350> bag<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.430> this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
little holes in your bag and what this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.180 
little holes in your bag and what this
is<00:02:27.760> gonna<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.510> create<00:02:29.290> openings<00:02:29.860> where<00:02:30.100> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
is gonna do is create openings where the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.540 
is gonna do is create openings where the
moisture<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.880> escape<00:02:31.240> slowly<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.990> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
moisture can escape slowly and the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.220 
moisture can escape slowly and the
climate<00:02:33.550> inside<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.300> bag<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.720> slowly<00:02:35.020> start

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
climate inside the bag will slowly start

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.920 
climate inside the bag will slowly start
to<00:02:35.650> match<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.160> outside<00:02:36.730> cut<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> couple<00:02:37.780> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
to match that outside cut a couple more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.650 
to match that outside cut a couple more
holes<00:02:38.260> every<00:02:38.680> day<00:02:38.890> or<00:02:39.040> two<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.490> then

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
holes every day or two and then

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.540 
holes every day or two and then
eventually<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.140> inside<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.920> outside<00:02:42.160> are

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
eventually the inside and outside are

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.400 
eventually the inside and outside are
going<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> match<00:02:42.970> at<00:02:43.540> which<00:02:43.720> point<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.260> can

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
going to match at which point you can

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.160 
going to match at which point you can
remove<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.980> bag<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:46.120> want<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.420> keep<00:02:46.720> your<00:02:46.960> new

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
remove the bag you want to keep your new

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.280 
remove the bag you want to keep your new
plant<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.460> location<00:02:48.880> that's<00:02:49.600> protected

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
plant in a location that's protected

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.080 
plant in a location that's protected
from<00:02:50.440> direct<00:02:50.620> sunlight<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.520> put<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
from direct sunlight so put it in a

filtered sunlight or a shady spot and if

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
filtered sunlight or a shady spot and if
you're<00:02:56.500> putting<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> ground<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.940> want

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
you're putting it in the ground you want

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.920 
you're putting it in the ground you want
to<00:02:58.270> keep<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:59.400> moisture<00:03:00.400> level<00:03:01.000> constant<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
to keep the moisture level constant and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.600 
to keep the moisture level constant and
you<00:03:02.050> want<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> try<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.500> cool<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.010> soil<00:03:03.400> around

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
you want to try to cool the soil around

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.420 
you want to try to cool the soil around
the<00:03:04.390> roots<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.959> put<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> good<00:03:05.650> heavy<00:03:05.980> layer<00:03:06.250> of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the roots so put a good heavy layer of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.540 
the roots so put a good heavy layer of
mulch<00:03:06.700> over<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.330> keep<00:03:08.230> your<00:03:08.380> plant<00:03:08.650> moist

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
mulch over that keep your plant moist

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.460 
mulch over that keep your plant moist
but<00:03:09.880> not<00:03:10.030> too<00:03:10.360> wet<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.840> don't<00:03:10.989> want<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> roots

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
but not too wet you don't want the roots

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.650 
but not too wet you don't want the roots
to<00:03:11.970> rot<00:03:12.970> inside<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> container<00:03:14.320> and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
to rot inside of the container and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.550 
to rot inside of the container and
eventually<00:03:16.660> those<00:03:16.870> roots<00:03:17.200> are<00:03:17.350> going<00:03:17.500> to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
eventually those roots are going to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.199 
eventually those roots are going to
become<00:03:17.980> stronger<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.820> we're<00:03:18.910> gonna<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
become stronger and we're gonna have a

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.570 
become stronger and we're gonna have a
nicely<00:03:19.450> established<00:03:20.260> new<00:03:20.500> rows<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.340> put<00:03:21.489> out

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
nicely established new rows to put out

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.150 
nicely established new rows to put out
in<00:03:21.670> our<00:03:21.790> garden
