00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 well in this video I will talk about what 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.080
 good and bad of the operating system 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080
 android 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'll start with the 5 things that most 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 they like this operating system 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 first is the ability to configure the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.029
 team to the taste of each person with this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.550
 I mean basically on android 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.739
 it's very easy to put things where 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.770
 we love them and make them 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.660
 see how we want them in this 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.850
 operating system there are very few 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 limitations in terms of customizing the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.220
 team is concerned and this is something that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 The second ones are very pleasant 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.600
 widgets this type of applications that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 they remain open all the time in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 our screen just seem to me 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 fantastic and very useful some of the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.780
 widgets that I use most are facebook twitter 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.450
 evernote and espn sportscenter and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.640
 anyone who let me know the weather 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.320
 the third is the large amount of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 applications that we found for 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.550
 Android there is an application available 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.450
 for virtually any need 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.280
 of the user either for entertainment 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 utility or for some other aspect 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 professional and I know that in others 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.940
 operating systems there is also a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 application for everything but this does not take away 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.190
 that the android store be every day 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.140
 better and more complete the fourth thing that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.720
 more I like about android is that it's a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 open operating system with this me 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 I mean that any company that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 want to make the hardware for this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 operating system can do it and this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 generates a lot of options 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.410
 for the user when choosing a 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.750
 team and usually among more 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 purchase options we have higher will 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.870
 the competition between these and therefore 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 better quality 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.660
 the fifth thing that I like most about 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.250
 android is this is it already I know that no 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.650
 has a lot to do with the system 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.570
 operative in itself but I consider that it is 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.970
 something that many people do not give 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.160
 the necessary importance something very 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.070
 important for every product and company 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.260
 is the image and it seems to me that google does 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.560
 a splendid work with the image of 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.630
 android 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.060
 it is only necessary to see this little 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.430
 green monkey to want to have one in the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 ledge of our room or our 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.450
 work desk remember that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 when someone is not an expert in 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.620
 technology like most of the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.989
 people in general the visual aspect 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.239
 of the product and its advertising by 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.519
 call it somehow take a lot 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.110
 importance and as I mentioned before 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.150
 from my point of view 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.940
 Android manages this aspect in a way 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.830
 excellent and with the backing of one of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750
 the most important companies in the world 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.460
 at present this is not any 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.410
 surprise 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.210
 now I 'm going to talk about the three 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.550
 things that I like least about this 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.190
 operating system or that I consider 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.080
 should improve the first one is that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.900
 Android does not offer an experience of 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.180
 equal quality to all its users and with 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.950
 this I mean the following the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.320
 Android operating system is 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.720
 written or designed to need 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.610
 great technical requirements this 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 means that if your team has a great 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.440
 dual core processor a lot ram and 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 a big battery your experience of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.090
 Android user will be very good but 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.880
 when the team runs android and it's not 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.460
 a high-end or high-end equipment the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.140
 experience is not of the same quality and 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.300
 it is just for this reason that in 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.880
 Sometimes we hear people talking 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 so great android and then 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.230
 we listen to another one mentioning that it is a 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.450
 slow operating system or not so 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.640
 good quality like others 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.830
 the second thing that I do not like about 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.349
 Android equipment is the life time in 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.060
 the battery most of the equipment 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.269
 high- end of this operating system 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.040
 They have very large screens and if 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.080
 this we add that android is a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.630
 operating system very active in terms of 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.340
 multi tasking and widgets this causes that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.370
 the life time in the battery of the 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.470
 equipment is not the best an example of 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.900
 this is the motorola droid grazer 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.180
 which went on the market and only a few 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.819
 months after the motorola droid came out 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.840
 razer max which is exactly what 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.629
 same but with a better battery 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.580
 and finally the third thing that I do not 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.940
 pleases of android is the way it is 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.049
 manage system updates 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.790
 mainly when they are changes 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.550
 great how to spend android 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.229
 gingerbread android ice cream sanwich el 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.880
 user must wait for the company 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.620
 what your team produces 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.770
 configure and adapt the operating system 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.810
 new to the team from my point of view 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.460
 this causes disorganization and 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.160
 Inequality between the operating system 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.530
 android apart from having to wait in 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.740
 some occasions enough time for 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.720
 receive the update we want in 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.600
 conclusion I consider android is a 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.490
 excellent operating system its virtues 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.650
 they are many compared to their 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
 aspects to improve any system 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.790
 operative is perfect here what 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.950
 matter is that each user chooses the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.500
 operating system that best suits 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.110
 your needs and tastes and as I mentioned 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.900
 before android is a very complete option 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.850
 and of high quality 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.889
 before I finish I want to make it clear 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.630
 that all of the above is just one 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.120
 personal opinion about the system 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.370
 operative android I know there are 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.050
 quite a few good things more like 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.630
 aspects to improve in this system 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.639
 operative but the intention of the video is 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.650
 share my point of view with you 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.410
 without getting to make a very long video 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.030
 I finished them boring let me know 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.970
 in the comments what it is that most 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.889
 like android and what is less 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.289
