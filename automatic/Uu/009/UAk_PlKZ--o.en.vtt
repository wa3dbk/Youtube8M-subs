00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.270
 very good to all here the doctor and 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.459
 commenting chicken and good as you know 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.260
 today starts in my third lic tournament 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.020
 of legends the third trillion tournament 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.519
 I organize sponsored by all cases and 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.019
 well I'll explain a little bit this is going 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.699
 to be an explanatory video pretty much 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.980
 what do you have to do in each challenge 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.599
 how do you have to act as you have 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.119
 postiga 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 I explain all this moves in the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 bottom ok you have to go to the forum 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.470
 and here in the tournament section fig 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.210
 fletcher you give him ekaitz and you'll see 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.390
 how many courses did you explain that you have to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.150
 do in each one to see to know what 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 hour you play against who to play and everything 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.650
 So whenever you have to give 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.460
 screw the brackets and give it to you 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.700
 here to the bracket and it will open on the page 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 of the bracket here all the equipment comes out 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.750
 as you can see on the left we said 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.489
 that have already gone through the fact that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.890
 the other teams could not play until 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.160
 now so they have passed me directly 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.500
 well you'll have to see here against 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.170
 who touches us is worth against who touches us 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.540
 and directly play against them as 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.570
 you see the first challenge that is the 22 phase 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.140
 years will be played from 18 to 20 feel and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.020
 enjoy in that hour the phase d 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.690
 of sixteenths will be played from 8 to 10 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.300
 and the eighth phase will be played 10 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.729
 to 12 that everything and tomorrow will be the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.729
 fourth semifinals and last will be 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.280
 in the final on Sunday will be the final as well 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.259
 what good that to see that you play at 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.840
 what time do you play and who is going and 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 everything in adding that up there we go back to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.170
 to the forum to see there are certain rules for the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.300
 I do not know as I said all there 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.740
 certain standards that are these for example 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.380
 we can play remaining now that it is 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.759
 programmed yes you can play in the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.390
 room hours at six but if you speak 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.119
 with the other team and tell them 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.619
 6 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.470
 you can play at 4 for example for 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.900
 advance it and so is already judged if the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.670
 another team accepts the play and it's 4 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.099
 if you do not accept I'm sorry but you have 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.870
 to be at 6 o'clock and how to set up a 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.330
 while it's easy is in game 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 customized and put in mode 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.910
 recruitment they were already putting a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.120
 password if that showing up only 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.160
 people are me and that but basically it's 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 that way recruitment we can play 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.730
 we can play the next day this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 we can no longer can not overtake 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.260
 but not to delay not because the tournament 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.000
 has some phases that have to be 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.980
 meet and can not delay a challenge 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 because it would interfere in tornado 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.579
 would delay the entire tornado then it will not 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.530
 can teacher can be overtaken 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.690
 we have a time limit to extract 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.660
 challenges and 15 minutes if in the first 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.579
 15 minutes the plan is all trying 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.739
 contact you and you have not 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.810
 appeared then obviously they have 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.660
 that bring new ones on the way tried 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.910
 contact with you 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.270
 surely you see where now 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.950
 then I will tell you and that if the 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.900
 premium plan that we have to do once 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.170
 finished the challenge is very simple be 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 finalize is the challenge we do not imagine me 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.890
 I'm going to put again, imagine you have 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.840
 finished the challenge you see here and here 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 there is one of this mine publishing 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.160
 results come here and for example yesterday 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.160
 he played one that was advanced 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.640
 or the one that contracted at 10 10 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.290
 advance photo of victory that's 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.930
 post a challenge that's what you have 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.910
 what to do when you have finished high 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.230
 simply posted for us 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.680
 we were updating the bracket but 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.020
 good for the subject of those of the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.520
 problems that do not appear as 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.690
 they have players who are not registered 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.920
 of things like that you go to the claims 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.340
 ok you go to the section of 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.020
 claims and put a post with the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.910
 claim to dispose as this one does not 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.040
 total state will try to pass tests 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.200
 because it is not worth to say this one and not 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.820
 inem state and given nothing will try 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.950
 carry drugs we will not throw what 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.670
 we will value and act according to what 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 we have to act 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.030
 we continue apart from this what happens if not 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.750
 only in the irrigation he gets insulted without 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.520
 reason 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.190
 what's said does not post in the forum 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.930
 claims and we will act will be taken 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.009
 the necessary steps that happens is the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.650
 initial has lost in game comes out every 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.270
 song and can not enter only if this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.590
 happens during the first five 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.150
 starting minutes in this case the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 option to restart the restaurant the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.720
 team opportunity this we're going to 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.449
 change this is not going to be like that they 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.520
 inform so you have it in mind if 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.860
 a player falls at the start of the game 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.780
 I'm very sorry but you will have to go back to 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.900
 reconnect quickly and why do I say 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.310
 this because many times many times in 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.050
 the first minutes especially in the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.539
 first two minutes you can do a 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.139
 invades that can cause about 23 casualties 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.909
 and the next moment we're 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.740
 within 5 minutes someone falling 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.300
 in the unfortunately then this what 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.130
 let's remove this tax but I'm going 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.800
 to remove me so I'm sorry but 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.810
 if someone falls bad luck does not have 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.039
 the fault then the only thing that will have 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.539
 what to do is to reconnect what 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.669
 as soon as possible when the two teams 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.710
 has the physical 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.090
 in what for 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.000
 here 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.800
 in the bracket the one that is up in the 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.990
 top position in the first round 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.449
 is the one that has the treasury to the 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.910
 Left which is down in the 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.919
 second in the next phase will be the 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.280
 down the one that has the treasury and the 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.190
 physique forgiveness and the one on top in the 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.850
 second and so on here will be the 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.850
 first and the second 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.420
 if a round has gone for example 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.100
 from 8 to 10 you can perfectly well 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:01.550
 mandatory to start it at 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:04.610
 8 and 10 at 8 15 minutes late and 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.200
 our team will lose but if it pacts 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.510
 jce with the other team that you can 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.190
 start at 9 company 29 without any 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.110
 micro problem because in a less than a 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.300
 time is finished a record can be 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.700
 measure substitutes if you can go substitutes 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.080
 but you have to post not in the forum 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.890
 of the tournament that is here where all your 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.680
 point 6 and modify it 15 minutes before 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.210
 of the sinodal retor will be my name so 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.640
 I think it was pretty clear 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.870
 Posting How do the challenges and how 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.110
 this I think there does not have to be any 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.000
 good problem and I wish you the best 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.400
 limits especially they have a good time 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.390
 and that the best gentlemen greetings to all 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.950
 If you have any doubt, post it 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.170
 posting where you are seeing that you 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.190
 taught by posting and clarifying what 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.820
 soon as possible 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.460
 important 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.550
 set the ehr record just in case 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.440

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.890
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting to
