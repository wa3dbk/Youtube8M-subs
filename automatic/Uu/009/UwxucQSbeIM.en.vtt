up<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:24.880> barrel<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> cup<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.450> i<00:02:28.480> would

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
up the me barrel of the cup so i would

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.640 
up the me barrel of the cup so i would
use<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.320> one<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:29.980> big<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:32.110> there<00:02:32.350> and

use this one it's big one there and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.100 
use this one it's big one there and
we'll<00:02:33.190> put<00:02:33.580> one<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.990> then<00:02:36.390> actually<00:02:37.390> needs<00:02:38.050> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
we'll put one that then actually needs a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.910 
we'll put one that then actually needs a
level<00:02:38.350> these<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.470> problem

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920

and<00:03:15.110> then<00:03:16.110> just<00:03:16.440> drag<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.770> into<00:03:16.950> position

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:48.480 

a<00:03:19.989> lot<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.880 

then<00:03:49.090> what<00:03:49.210> you<00:03:49.270> want<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.420> do<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.840> want<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.540 
then what you want to do is you want to
line<00:03:51.130> them<00:03:51.310> up<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:52.320> equal<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.640> wheels<00:03:55.260> well

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
line them up in equal to the wheels well

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.110 
line them up in equal to the wheels well
relatively<00:03:57.550> equal<00:03:58.090> maybe<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.490> one

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
relatively equal maybe just to the one

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.080 
relatively equal maybe just to the one
side<00:04:01.330> as<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:02.050> can<00:04:02.200> see<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.670> like<00:04:03.760> exactly

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
side as you can see it's like exactly

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.120 
side as you can see it's like exactly
bangle<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.660> middle<00:04:04.870> make<00:04:05.590> sure<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:05.830> even

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
bangle in the middle make sure it's even

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.860 
bangle in the middle make sure it's even
not<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.660> content<00:04:09.450> then<00:04:10.450> we<00:04:10.630> got<00:04:10.780> to

want to see test it as you can see it's
working<00:04:38.530> really<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.550> speed<00:04:39.820> isn't<00:04:40.300> too<00:04:40.750> good

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
working really the speed isn't too good

thrusters to the gothy big one I find

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.500 
thrusters to the gothy big one I find
them<00:04:57.370> they're<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> bit<00:04:57.910> more<00:04:58.030> powerful<00:04:58.420> than

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
them they're a bit more powerful than

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.920 
them they're a bit more powerful than
the<00:04:58.660> rest<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.610> you'll<00:05:00.790> need<00:05:00.970> one<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.750> left

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
put them on this earth so that the

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.029 
put them on this earth so that the
content<00:05:11.009> will<00:05:11.249> turn<00:05:11.759> out<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:13.590> then<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.800> always

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
content will turn out and then I always

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:23.750 
content will turn out and then I always
put<00:05:14.189> one<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.610> like<00:05:14.909> this<00:05:15.030> side<00:05:15.210> here

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:33.839 

um<00:05:24.760> was<00:05:25.000> he<00:05:25.150> gonna<00:05:25.300> say<00:05:25.840> linear<00:05:25.990> site

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.119 

I<00:05:33.939> just<00:05:34.539> Ave<00:05:34.749> sure<00:05:34.899> we<00:05:35.229> can<00:05:35.379> test<00:05:35.559> it<00:05:35.740> is

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
I just Ave sure we can test it is

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.480 
I just Ave sure we can test it is
working<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.699> it<00:05:37.360> isn't<00:05:37.629> because<00:05:37.689> i<00:05:37.929> am<00:05:38.490> not

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
working and it isn't because i am not

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.859 
working and it isn't because i am not
like<00:05:39.699> let<00:05:40.059> it<00:05:40.089> go<00:05:40.240> ahead<00:05:41.999> anyway<00:05:42.999> and<00:05:43.029> as<00:05:43.719> you

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:43.869 
like let it go ahead anyway and as you

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.019 
like let it go ahead anyway and as you
can<00:05:43.990> see<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.289> is<00:05:44.379> working<00:05:44.649> at<00:05:44.919> a<00:05:45.039> slob<00:05:45.580> but<00:05:45.819> once

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
can see it is working at a slob but once

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.969 
can see it is working at a slob but once
again<00:05:46.149> you<00:05:46.300> can<00:05:46.509> always<00:05:46.719> use<00:05:46.929> more<00:05:47.439> acidity

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
again you can always use more acidity

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.059 
again you can always use more acidity
make<00:05:48.399> it<00:05:48.520> faster<00:05:48.939> what<00:05:49.899> site<00:05:50.139> is<00:05:50.169> complete<00:05:50.649> if

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
make it faster what site is complete if

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.389 
make it faster what site is complete if
you<00:05:51.819> go<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.360> i<00:05:52.659> think<00:05:52.809> is<00:05:53.050> garys<00:05:53.469> mod<00:05:53.499> org<00:05:54.099> and

working cam just to show you how

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:19.860 
working cam just to show you how
powerful<00:06:10.149> the<00:06:10.240> cannon<00:06:10.599> is

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.780 

sure<00:06:20.710> enough<00:06:22.620> like<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:23.650> said<00:06:23.830> you<00:06:23.980> can<00:06:24.010> end<00:06:24.580> it

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
sure enough like I said you can end it

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.060 
sure enough like I said you can end it
up<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.570> you<00:06:26.380> can<00:06:26.560> hear<00:06:26.680> me<00:06:26.950> down<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.860> can

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
up and you can hear me down this can

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.620 
up and you can hear me down this can
actually<00:06:30.160> cook<00:06:30.460> behalf<00:06:30.790> of<00:06:30.820> the<00:06:31.120> map<00:06:31.360> will

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
actually cook behalf of the map will

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.590 
actually cook behalf of the map will
half<00:06:31.900> of<00:06:32.110> this<00:06:32.260> map<00:06:32.470> anyone<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.730> let's<00:06:33.940> test<00:06:34.450> it
