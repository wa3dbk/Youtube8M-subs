00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.729
 hi friends my name is juan luis 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:06.680
 For some time now I have decided to buy a new next-generation console 

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.099
 but the question is simple 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.539
 of all is the best if we talk about the latest generation we are saying 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.460
 speed graphics resolution 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.579
 and others and others good if in this we vary then the last consoles 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.109
 from nintendo 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.189
 and microsoft 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.039
 we are talking about the xbox 360 and this is three since the blessed wii of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 Nintendo is a total crap 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.060
 because their graphics are something only somewhat better than twenty-one pri 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.760
 because it uses wireless controls that for me are total stupidity since 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.260
 it's like you're playing with a fucking remote control 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.039
 but for the lovers of pokémon and the mustachioed dwarf of mario shit this 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.749
 console is a good option 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.440
 in a few words you will be wearing an improved 22 with controls 

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.879
 wireless that look like a TV control stupidity 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.140
 I'm just going to spend my time talking about these last two first 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.080
 xbox presence in 33 offer removed an ass consoles and each with 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.940
 different memory but to the surprise of 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.149
 all the shit 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.619
 since 'what is the use of so many consoles and so many types of memories 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.929
 if you want to have fun for an average of hours the fucking console is going 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.689
 to warn with its red lights that is about to burn the fucked 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.969
 plate that she is the falcon jasper wave does not last you nor shit if it warns you anyway 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.349
 that is about to burn and you have to put a damp cloth so that the 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.939
 doomed do not make cheese 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.780
 now let's go to the controls 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.830
 I do not like 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.550
 they are very large and the defect that it has is that you have to be changing as 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.040
 a dumbass every two to three hours of play the blessed batteries since you're going to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.750
 spend more heartfelt than in the game point plus the reproduction of the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.890
 xbox need country to divide I find it totally stupid the new htc visit 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 they have taken out 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 total shit 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.020
 If you want to enter the internet you have to pay and also the same console 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.640
 shit is not wireless for that you have to buy an accessible antenna 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.400
 of uefa and for the interpreter to do 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.050
 in summary for me 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.220
 they loaded it with all this 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.240
 let's talk about the fight and this is three 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.960
 they have taken out the model is linke comes from 120 gigs and 250 pounds 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.360
 quite good models of memory 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 the good thing about this console is that it has uefa and you do not pay a fucking penny for 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.600
 enter the internet in addition your blu-ray system is very good 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.689
 blu-ray is not better than the slut hb divide 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.459
 if we talk about price is accessible let's say if on the street you want 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.279
 buy a blu-ray that costs $ 300 and then hire a console 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.420
 last generation I say that you are a fucking asshole 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 since the fullness that part of playing movies and games in 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.230
 blu-ray you have availability to play the latest games of the year 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.050
 that is, instead of spending extra dollars on a blu-ray player 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 with something extra of 100 dollars or more you buy the fullness is that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.990
 telephone and plays movies in blu-ray 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.380
 what else to say finally is its controls are the classic controls of the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.660
 generation of the fight and one is to say 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.009
 if you had to read one and two I do not know what he's going to do 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.339
 problem the gameplay for the fight and 3 also does not use batteries like the other 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.700
 two previous shits since they are rechargeable in their entirety 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.109
 the choice is yours 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.450
 if you're still a child and you live in a fantasy world is the uni 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.540
 if you want to make richer and millionaire abi félix is ​​the xbox presents 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.240
 and if you want to see and play good movies in blu-ray is the fight and 3 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.579
 I hope this money has been of your help 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.209
 Thank you
