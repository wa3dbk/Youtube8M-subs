00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
consideration that unlike on our phones

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
consideration that unlike on our phones
where<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> touchscreen<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:46.110> our

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
where we have a touchscreen on our

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.950 
where we have a touchscreen on our
Android<00:00:46.920> TV<00:00:47.190> boxes<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.910> our<00:00:48.120> TVs<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.719> don't

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
Android TV boxes and on our TVs we don't

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
Android TV boxes and on our TVs we don't
have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.320> touch<00:00:49.590> screen<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> interact<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have a touch screen to interact with the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
have a touch screen to interact with the
box<00:00:51.899> itself<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> rely<00:00:53.399> on

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
box itself so we will have to rely on

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
box itself so we will have to rely on
keyboards<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.480> Mouse's<00:00:55.320> remote<00:00:55.800> controls<00:00:56.250> or

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
keyboards on Mouse's remote controls or

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.330 
keyboards on Mouse's remote controls or
even<00:00:57.059> game<00:00:57.390> pads<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.770> opinion<00:00:59.039> are

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
even game pads which on my opinion are

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490 
even game pads which on my opinion are
the<00:00:59.370> best<00:00:59.670> tool<00:00:59.940> for<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.449> gaming<00:01:00.780> side<00:01:01.230> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the best tool for the gaming side of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
the best tool for the gaming side of
things<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> challenging<00:01:03.090> part<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
things now the challenging part is that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.160 
things now the challenging part is that
not<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.379> games<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:05.250> optimized<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.390> gamepad

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
not all games are optimized for gamepad

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830 
not all games are optimized for gamepad
so<00:01:07.409> many<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> them<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> my

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so many of them will not work and my

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
so many of them will not work and my
idea<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.409> objective<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.850> able<00:01:11.909> to
