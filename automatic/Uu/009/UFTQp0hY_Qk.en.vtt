Nexus device it's great news and I hope
the<00:00:23.880> experiment<00:00:24.390> expands<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> include<00:00:25.109> more

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the experiment expands to include more

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
the experiment expands to include more
and<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.070> great<00:00:26.340> devices<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.330> be

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and more great devices out there and be

with<00:01:18.750> open-source<00:01:19.170> drivers<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
with open-source drivers of what not I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
with open-source drivers of what not I
mean<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> android<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.869> license

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
mean think about it android is license

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
mean think about it android is license
with<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> apache<00:01:23.100> license<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.090> so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
with the apache license that so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.640 
with the apache license that so
companies<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.869> take<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.409> make<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
companies can take it and make it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.950 
companies can take it and make it
proprietary<00:01:25.979> software<00:01:26.580> google<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.659> about

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
proprietary software google is all about

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
proprietary software google is all about
enabling<00:01:28.259> companies<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> android<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
enabling companies here and android is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
already on the Xperia S I mean what

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
already on the Xperia S I mean what
benefit<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> company<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> putting

benefit is there to a company of putting
it<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.189> device<00:01:35.369> again<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it on that device again well I have a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
it on that device again well I have a
few<00:01:36.840> ideas<00:01:36.869> first<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> simple<00:01:38.700> fact

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
few ideas first there's the simple fact

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.450 
few ideas first there's the simple fact
that<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.420> makes<00:01:39.799> open-source<00:01:40.799> alternatives

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that this makes open-source alternatives

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.789 
that this makes open-source alternatives

this<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.410> mutually<00:03:18.950> beneficial<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.760> know

this is mutually beneficial and you know

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.729 
this is mutually beneficial and you know
it<00:03:20.030> feels<00:03:20.209> good<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> play<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> more<00:03:20.989> direct<00:03:21.350> role
