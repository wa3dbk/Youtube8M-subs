she's<00:02:19.100> kind<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.400> evil<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.330> her<00:02:20.990> skin<00:02:21.230> has

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
she's kind of evil so her skin has

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.620 
she's kind of evil so her skin has
changed<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:22.160> she<00:02:22.250> has<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> different<00:02:22.820> robe<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.300 
changed as she has a different robe and
this<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.020> just<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.380> demonstrate<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.070> fact

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
this is just to demonstrate the fact

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.740 
this is just to demonstrate the fact
that<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.030> make<00:02:26.210> those<00:02:26.420> choices

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
that we can make those choices

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.300 
that we can make those choices
throughout<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> game<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.890> turn<00:02:28.130> your

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
throughout the game to turn your

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.490 
throughout the game to turn your
character<00:02:28.490> good<00:02:28.910> or<00:02:29.030> evil<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.900> won't<00:02:30.080> see<00:02:30.380> an

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
character good or evil you won't see an

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.860 
character good or evil you won't see an
instant<00:02:31.010> switch<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.030> darker<00:02:32.390> white<00:02:32.570> side

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
instant switch to the darker white side

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.510 
instant switch to the darker white side
but<00:02:33.230> it'll<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.470> subtle<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.130> go<00:02:34.280> through

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
but it'll be subtle as you go through

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.810 
but it'll be subtle as you go through
the<00:02:34.610> game<00:02:35.620> we'll<00:02:36.620> also<00:02:36.890> be<00:02:37.190> able<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.430> affect

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
alignment of characters around you so my

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.020 
alignment of characters around you so my

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
character is glowing red that means that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.940

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
which means are neutral and if they were

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.990 
which means are neutral and if they were
good<00:03:03.500> characters<00:03:03.980> they'd<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.220> glowing<00:03:04.520> blue

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
good characters they'd be glowing blue

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.090 
good characters they'd be glowing blue
and<00:03:05.390> this<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.540> useful<00:03:06.230> if<00:03:06.590> you're<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.830> an<00:03:06.920> area
