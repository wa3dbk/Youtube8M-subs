00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
the type of flour and quality of flour

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.010 
the type of flour and quality of flour
it's<00:00:38.610> important<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.150> bring<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.840> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's important that we bring that all of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.610 
it's important that we bring that all of
those<00:00:40.080> ingredients<00:00:40.290> together<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.400> form<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
those ingredients together to form a

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.360 
those ingredients together to form a
relatively<00:00:43.620> smooth<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.220> soft<00:00:44.580> ball<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
relatively smooth and soft ball this is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
relatively smooth and soft ball this is
what<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> call<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> base<00:00:48.060> dough<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.810> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
what we call the base dough and it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860 
what we call the base dough and it's
this<00:00:49.590> dough<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.220> add<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.180> additional

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this dough that we add the additional

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.970 
this dough that we add the additional
butter<00:00:52.740> to<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:54.150> cause<00:00:54.360> they're<00:00:54.900> laminating<00:00:55.710> or

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
butter to to cause they're laminating or

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.550 
butter to to cause they're laminating or
the<00:00:56.400> many<00:00:57.210> many<00:00:57.420> layers<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.900> butter<00:00:58.380> and<00:00:58.620> fat

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
the many many layers of butter and fat

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.020 
the many many layers of butter and fat
so<00:01:01.560> in<00:01:01.950> this<00:01:02.130> case<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.580> we're<00:01:02.700> just<00:01:02.730> adding<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so in this case here we're just adding a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.399 
so in this case here we're just adding a
little<00:01:03.060> more<00:01:03.390> water<00:01:03.450> to<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.290> bit

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
little more water to it was a little bit

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.149 
little more water to it was a little bit
dry<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.869> can<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.049> they're<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.259> adding<00:01:08.009> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
dry you can see they're just adding a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:08.630 
dry you can see they're just adding a
little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.369> more

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
little bit more

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.489 
little bit more
so<00:01:09.329> there<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.719> a<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.109> variance

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:10.499 
so there will be a bit of a variance

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.459 
so there will be a bit of a variance
every<00:01:10.740> single<00:01:11.009> time<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.249> make<00:01:11.429> it<00:01:12.469> kneading

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
every single time you make it kneading

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.289 
every single time you make it kneading
it<00:01:13.560> by<00:01:13.590> hand<00:01:14.039> here<00:01:14.280> bringing<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.149> together

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it by hand here bringing it together

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.029 
it by hand here bringing it together
working<00:01:15.929> at<00:01:16.079> developing<00:01:16.229> some<00:01:16.829> of<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
working at developing some of that

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.929 
working at developing some of that
gluten<00:01:17.960> we<00:01:18.960> add<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.319> white<00:01:20.069> wine<00:01:20.100> vinegar<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
gluten we add the white wine vinegar to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
gluten we add the white wine vinegar to
the<00:01:21.030> dough<00:01:21.179> it's<00:01:21.569> quite<00:01:21.749> important<00:01:22.200> because

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the dough it's quite important because

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
the dough it's quite important because
it<00:01:22.469> actually<00:01:22.499> strengthens<00:01:23.249> the<00:01:23.490> gluten<00:01:23.850> gives

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it actually strengthens the gluten gives

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.169 
it actually strengthens the gluten gives
it<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> bit<00:01:24.749> of<00:01:24.810> elasticity<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.640> helps<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
it a bit of elasticity and helps it

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.719 
it a bit of elasticity and helps it
later<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.130> rolling<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> stretching

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
later on with the rolling and stretching

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.389 
later on with the rolling and stretching
process<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.479> dough<00:01:30.659> undergoes<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
process that the dough undergoes you can

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.520 
process that the dough undergoes you can
see<00:01:32.549> we've<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.969> done<00:01:33.210> probably<00:01:33.749> worked<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
see we've just done probably worked up

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.679 
see we've just done probably worked up
for<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.889> minute<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.249> a<00:01:35.340> half<00:01:35.369> yes<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
for about a minute and a half yes and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.260 
for about a minute and a half yes and
we've<00:01:37.109> bought<00:01:37.350> together<00:01:37.609> our<00:01:38.609> base<00:01:38.880> dough

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
we've bought together our base dough

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.419 
we've bought together our base dough
trying<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> keep<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> smooth<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.310> want

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
trying to keep it smooth we don't want

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.620 
trying to keep it smooth we don't want
to<00:01:41.490> overwork<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.149> otherwise<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.420> gonna<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
to overwork it otherwise it's gonna be

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.789 
to overwork it otherwise it's gonna be
difficult<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.049> roll<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.319> later<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:45.709> here<00:01:46.709> we

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
difficult to roll out later on here we

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
difficult to roll out later on here we
just<00:01:46.889> place<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.249> cross<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
just place a little cross on it and this

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.639 
just place a little cross on it and this
is<00:01:48.450> how<00:01:48.600> we're<00:01:48.749> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> incorporate<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is how we're going to incorporate the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.469 
is how we're going to incorporate the
butter<00:01:49.770> later<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.030> team<00:01:51.209> placed

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
butter later on and it's team placed

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
butter later on and it's team placed
into<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> fridge<00:01:52.139> and<00:01:52.380> allowed<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> sit<00:01:53.159> for

into the fridge and allowed to sit for

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.239 
into the fridge and allowed to sit for
about<00:01:53.729> half<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.299> hour<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.679> clip<00:01:55.979> here

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
about half an hour in this clip here

on the corner of a bench where it's a
little<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.429> sturdier<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.479> we've<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.779> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
little bit sturdier and we've got the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.379 
little bit sturdier and we've got the
diced<00:02:04.049> butter<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.529> we're<00:02:04.679> just<00:02:05.060> working<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
diced butter and we're just working it

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.120 
diced butter and we're just working it
with<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.990> rolling<00:02:07.170> pan<00:02:07.499> and<00:02:07.979> what

with the back of a rolling pan and what

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.230 
with the back of a rolling pan and what
we're<00:02:08.250> creating<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.729> air<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.880> sort<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.090> making

we're creating the air is sort of making

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.270 
we're creating the air is sort of making
the<00:02:09.539> butter<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.869> malleable<00:02:10.129> one<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.189> the

the butter more malleable one of the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.860 
the butter more malleable one of the
really<00:02:11.459> important<00:02:11.909> steps<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.330> making<00:02:12.480> puff

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
really important steps of making puff

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.500 
really important steps of making puff
pastry<00:02:13.319> puff<00:02:13.950> butter<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.299> base

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
pastry puff butter is that the base

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.250 
pastry puff butter is that the base
dough<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
dough in the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.350 
dough in the
at<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> same<00:02:16.860> consistency<00:02:17.730> well<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.150> same

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
at the same consistency well the same

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.559 
at the same consistency well the same
teacher<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.890> helps<00:02:20.189> of<00:02:20.340> even<00:02:20.819> rolling<00:02:21.030> layer

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
teacher this helps of even rolling layer

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.460 
teacher this helps of even rolling layer
later<00:02:21.989> on<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.829> it<00:02:22.890> also<00:02:23.040> prevents<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.610> butter

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
later on and it also prevents the butter

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
later on and it also prevents the butter
bursting<00:02:25.470> through<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.890> dough<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.549> too

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
bursting through the dough if it's too

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.819 
bursting through the dough if it's too
firm<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.989> it's<00:02:28.230> quite<00:02:28.409> an<00:02:28.530> important<00:02:28.920> step

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
firm so it's quite an important step

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.050 
firm so it's quite an important step
once<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.040> dough<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.220> rested<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.819> fridge

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
once the dough is rested in the fridge

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.580 
once the dough is rested in the fridge
for<00:02:33.269> around<00:02:33.390> about<00:02:33.750> half<00:02:34.049> an<00:02:34.260> hour<00:02:34.379> mark

called<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.860> ears<00:02:41.069> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.700> puff<00:02:41.849> pastry<00:02:42.530> and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
called the ears of the puff pastry and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.910 
called the ears of the puff pastry and
we<00:02:43.829> just<00:02:44.010> simply<00:02:44.310> pin<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.209> out

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
we just simply pin them out

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.809 
we just simply pin them out
and<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.129> we're<00:02:47.280> doing<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.549> we're<00:02:47.700> creating

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and what we're doing is we're creating

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.569 
and what we're doing is we're creating
an<00:02:48.269> envelope<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.680> then<00:02:49.829> place<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.129> butter

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
an envelope we can then place the butter

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.839 
an envelope we can then place the butter
inside<00:02:51.359> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.920> little<00:02:53.280> bump<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.670> middle

inside of the little bump in the middle

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.509 
inside of the little bump in the middle
there<00:02:54.260> we<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.379> place<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.799> butter<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
there we can place the butter in the

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.490 
there we can place the butter in the
middle<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.060> dough<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.480> fold<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.109> up<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
middle of the dough and fold it up and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.319 
middle of the dough and fold it up and
incorporate<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.489> butter<00:02:59.670> under<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> dough

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
incorporate the butter under the dough

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.140 
incorporate the butter under the dough
and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.409> we<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.620> start<00:03:01.889> proceed<00:03:02.370> proceed<00:03:03.239> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and then we can start proceed proceed to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.270 
and then we can start proceed proceed to
rolling<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.930> dough<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.409> creating<00:03:08.159> the

ready to incorporate what we called tune

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.520 
ready to incorporate what we called tune
you're<00:03:42.449> probably<00:03:42.870> once<00:03:43.169> you've<00:03:43.290> incorporated

you're probably once you've incorporated
the<00:03:43.829> butter<00:03:43.949> you'll<00:03:44.099> probably<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.760> able<00:03:44.849> to

keep even pressure across the pastry so

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.280 
keep even pressure across the pastry so

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
butter coming out and you can see in the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.390 
butter coming out and you can see in the
demonstration<00:03:58.829> here<00:03:58.949> we're<00:03:59.069> trying<00:03:59.159> to<00:03:59.280> keep

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
demonstration here we're trying to keep

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.750 
demonstration here we're trying to keep
all<00:03:59.879> of<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.299> ins<00:04:00.709> square<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:02.069> all<00:04:02.190> times<00:04:02.459> and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
all of the ins square at all times and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.220 
all of the ins square at all times and
that's<00:04:02.819> importance<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.599> we<00:04:03.720> end<00:04:03.959> up<00:04:04.079> with

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that's importance of it we end up with

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.520 
that's importance of it we end up with
an<00:04:04.349> even<00:04:04.620> rise<00:04:04.980> later<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:06.199> and<00:04:07.199> here<00:04:07.409> we<00:04:07.500> are

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
an even rise later on and here we are

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.000 
an even rise later on and here we are
incorporating<00:04:08.250> what<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.519> call<00:04:08.699> a<00:04:08.970> single<00:04:09.540> turn

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
incorporating what we call a single turn

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.110 
incorporating what we call a single turn
so<00:04:11.010> we're<00:04:11.159> following<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.549> top<00:04:11.699> down<00:04:11.909> and<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
so we're following the top down and the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.330 
so we're following the top down and the
bottom<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.449> and<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.799> single<00:04:13.979> turn<00:04:14.280> or

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
bottom up and it's a single turn or

single book fold it's also known is just

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.649 
single book fold it's also known is just
betting<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.799> out<00:04:19.919> lightly<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:21.239> will<00:04:21.329> then<00:04:21.510> go

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
betting it out lightly that will then go

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.240 
betting it out lightly that will then go
back<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.049> fridge<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.470> rest<00:04:22.949> for<00:04:23.159> about

once it's rested for about half an hour

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.760 
once it's rested for about half an hour
we<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:29.540> then<00:04:29.720> roll<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.020> pastry<00:04:30.199> over<00:04:30.410> again

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
we can then roll the pastry over again

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.100 
we can then roll the pastry over again
and<00:04:30.979> incorporate<00:04:31.760> another<00:04:32.210> turn<00:04:32.510> we<00:04:32.840> may<00:04:32.990> even

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
and incorporate another turn we may even

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.760 
and incorporate another turn we may even
be<00:04:33.229> able<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.470> incorporate<00:04:33.650> two<00:04:34.160> Tunes<00:04:35.440> in<00:04:36.440> this

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
be able to incorporate two Tunes in this

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.000 
be able to incorporate two Tunes in this
process<00:04:37.250> here<00:04:38.030> we<00:04:38.120> are<00:04:38.240> rolling<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.630> out<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:39.010> a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
process here we are rolling it out to a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.629 
process here we are rolling it out to a
long<00:04:40.490> rectangle<00:04:41.120> again<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> we<00:04:43.130> going<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.490> do

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
long rectangle again and we going to do

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.280 
long rectangle again and we going to do
a<00:04:43.880> technique<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.449> putting<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.810> single<00:04:45.139> tune

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
a technique of putting in a single tune

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.650 
a technique of putting in a single tune
again<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:46.580> see<00:04:46.760> here<00:04:46.940> bottom-up<00:04:47.449> top-down

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
end turning it clockwise that's now had

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.159 
end turning it clockwise that's now had
two<00:04:53.389> tunes<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:54.190> marking<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.220> as<00:04:55.490> appropriate

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.930 
two tunes and marking it as appropriate
we<00:04:57.169> can<00:04:57.440> incorporate<00:04:58.010> what<00:04:58.460> we<00:04:58.490> call<00:04:58.699> a<00:04:58.729> double

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
we can incorporate what we call a double

we can incorporate what we call a double
tuned<00:04:59.300> into<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.930> process<00:05:00.520> see<00:05:01.520> here<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:01.850> are

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
tuned into the process see here we are

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.250 
tuned into the process see here we are
making<00:05:02.270> what<00:05:02.389> we<00:05:02.479> call<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.720> police<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.930> gum

we<00:05:07.400> need<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.669> have<00:05:07.850> six<00:05:08.750> Tunes<00:05:09.080> we<00:05:09.530> need<00:05:09.710> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
we need to have six Tunes we need to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.800 
we need to have six Tunes we need to
risk<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.100> pastry<00:05:10.610> 20<00:05:11.120> minutes<00:05:11.419> between<00:05:11.600> each

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
risk the pastry 20 minutes between each

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
risk the pastry 20 minutes between each
tune<00:05:13.030> once<00:05:14.030> we've<00:05:14.240> incorporated<00:05:15.020> all<00:05:15.530> six

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
tune once we've incorporated all six

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.100 
tune once we've incorporated all six
Tunes<00:05:16.100> it's<00:05:16.490> now<00:05:16.699> ready<00:05:17.030> for<00:05:17.210> panning<00:05:17.660> out<00:05:17.810> for

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
Tunes it's now ready for panning out for

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.310 
Tunes it's now ready for panning out for
use<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.030> stove<00:05:20.240> here<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:20.630> head<00:05:20.810> six<00:05:21.080> turn

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
use so the stove here is head six turn

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.750 
use so the stove here is head six turn
so<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.560> process<00:05:22.010> will<00:05:22.160> take<00:05:22.220> about<00:05:22.430> four

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
so the process will take about four

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.330 
so the process will take about four
hours<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:23.180> achieve<00:05:23.479> that<00:05:23.949> from<00:05:24.949> start<00:05:25.220> to

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
hours to achieve that from start to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.400 
hours to achieve that from start to
finish<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.850> now<00:05:26.539> we're<00:05:26.690> just<00:05:26.780> putting<00:05:27.289> out

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
finish and now we're just putting out

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.950 
finish and now we're just putting out
the<00:05:27.560> pastry<00:05:27.949> and<00:05:28.940> making<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.330> ready<00:05:29.539> for<00:05:29.600> use

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
the pastry and making it ready for use

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.230 
the pastry and making it ready for use
you<00:05:30.260> can<00:05:31.220> see<00:05:31.370> it's<00:05:31.520> on<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.639> lightly<00:05:32.120> floured

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
you can see it's on a lightly floured

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.820 
you can see it's on a lightly floured
bench<00:05:33.039> and<00:05:34.270> working<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.360> pastry<00:05:35.840> evenly

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
bench and working the pastry evenly

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.339 
bench and working the pastry evenly
across<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.520> bench<00:05:37.669> again<00:05:38.599> applying<00:05:39.110> even

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
across the bench again applying even

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.840 
across the bench again applying even
pressure<00:05:39.530> which<00:05:40.099> is<00:05:40.280> quite<00:05:40.520> important

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.350 

yeah<00:05:46.340> it's<00:05:47.340> also<00:05:47.490> important<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.150> note<00:05:48.330> that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
yeah it's also important to note that

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.530 
yeah it's also important to note that
before<00:05:49.350> we<00:05:49.710> go<00:05:49.890> to<00:05:49.950> user<00:05:50.550> pastry<00:05:51.030> we<00:05:51.270> need<00:05:51.420> to

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
before we go to user pastry we need to

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.180 
before we go to user pastry we need to
after<00:05:51.750> rolling<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.290> out<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.650> before<00:05:53.010> baking

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
after rolling it out and before baking

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.330 
after rolling it out and before baking
we<00:05:53.400> need<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.700> rest<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.120> that<00:05:54.540> allows<00:05:55.340> allows

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
we need to rest it that allows allows
