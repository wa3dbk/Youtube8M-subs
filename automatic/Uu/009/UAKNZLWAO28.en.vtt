00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi guys is that vanessa sneakers 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.029
 reading center and today will be very 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 especially because I'm going to review a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.590
 book that marked me the name of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 book is the president to discover the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.080
 reverse secrets 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 it will be released by the publisher 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 next and moves I think until April 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 You 're going to have to leave so keep an eye out. 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 because so the book released you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 need to buy this book by talking 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 seriously this book will tell the story 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.810
 of the aristotle that the girl of 15 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.910
 years that is going through that phase 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.560
 life in which he is entering the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 Then everything starts to change. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.930
 Who is he becoming who he is? 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 it was before and who he wants to be at last 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.570
 all the questions that for him 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.879
 seem much more complex because it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.489
 lives with very great anger inside him 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.780
 he has an extremely 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.789
 negative pessimist of life 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.800
 he always felt half displaced him 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.420
 never been able to relate to the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 other boys his age he always 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 found the conversations of these boys very 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.480
 without notion he has much problem in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 approaching his father is also a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 war veteran and lived the war 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 inside it so it is very far 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.979
 word he can not make the connection 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 with the child then at the same time as he 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.159
 try to discover the mysteries of life he 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 tries to discover his mysteries 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 himself and the mysteries of his father, right? 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.890
 with what is live with so many ghosts 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.990
 of war inside said 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 until the moment he meets the dante is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 a boy the same age as him 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 becomes his first friend and he is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 completely different from Aristotle 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.740
 dante is described as a face that seems to 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.420
 have much joy to live a guy who 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.610
 has a good relationship with the family that has 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 great relationship of friendship with others 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.170
 people and someone fully happy but 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 although it seems like something my black in the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.860
 white as a student would be happy 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 the sad story of the story that goes 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.290
 learn with dante will become happy 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 also 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.060
 things are not quite so both are 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 well-built characters then 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 he has all that human complexity 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 same nobody is totally happy 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.040
 totally sad before you have your 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.950
 moments of weakness and look I am 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.630
 licensed 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.119
 moments in which he believes that perhaps 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.759
 there is some good in it maybe really 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.679
 there is something in it that can be called by 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.119
 other people, not only am I 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.399
 bringing dante are constructed of 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.500
 very realistic way but all the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.200
 secondary characters supporting that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.120
 appear in the father-like story and the mother of the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.510
 dante the father the oldest story they 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.310
 they are so you know these 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.319
 people these people are real 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.170
 beautiful are not characters from the book they 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.239
 really do not seem like they 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 were characters created on paper 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.200
 because they are very full of din 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.989
 perfection of a cei 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.209
 so it's very beautiful to see the thought of 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.799
 aristotle and how he will deal with 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.140
 changes that the dante will bring to life 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.209
 it is the differential of this book that 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.549
 really made me get excited about it. 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.890
 from the first page is the writing of the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.620
 author he loudly has such a 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.110
 poetic then magic so touching her so 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.060
 permeated by images strong symbolisms 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.430
 It's such a bad thing that it appeared here. 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.560
 each paragraph had a lot of poetry 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
 being imitated next to me you know 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.940
 I never got so much the book in all my 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.670
 life like that every paragraph had 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.470
 phrases that thrilled me even in the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.720
 more mundane descriptions like aristotle 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.420
 describes the storms as it is 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.430
 describes the look of someone's smile 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.019
 someone 's face he uses 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.970
 many expressions such as the person who 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.920
 carried a sun in itself or the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.470
 person carrying a river within himself 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.569
 and how the storms seem to try 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.910
 destroy the world plus one that refuses to 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.880
 be destroyed then only very passages 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.680
 powerful and yes for the weak 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.319
 The team for you book is really 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.269
 very special poetic but not 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.910
 poetic writing that will renew the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.250
 format of the 100- proof book is 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.829
 really a simple language book 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.450
 written for the young public audience 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.489
 young adult I do not know but it's a language 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.730
 very simple including the book in English 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.079
 and it's very easy English not all 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.180
 books in English I would if it is 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.519
 easier picture but that language 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.579
 Beautiful know the words used are 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.439
 beautiful words I recommend great 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.720
 Mind that you give English if you 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.530
 they know because what is that language 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.870
 very poetic that goes 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.490
 get lost in the post a translation can be 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.860
 one that does not get caught totally but 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.440
 sure something else to lose know 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.299
 they are very accurate very exact words 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.430
 for the production of a fully capture 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.530
 excellent shape and something very 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.450
 in this book as it is structured 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.700
 it is divided into think in five 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.280
 parties I do not know anything else like that and 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.350
 each part has several chapters type 20 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.660
 chapters within each part and the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.639
 chapters do not follow a pattern of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.230
 have only that they will have several 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.750
 pages that will have two 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.030
 pages and fields that will be two 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.880
 lines in the paragraph only the description 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.190
 of a feeling of a scene but the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.470
 fact of this scene of this feeling is 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.720
 being separated and a different chapter 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.040
 of the remainder makes you pay more 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.410
 attention that thing being 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.260
 writing gives a greater impact not 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.510
 I would have had at that description 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.490
 from other chapters I then understood everything 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.380
 was very well thought out by the vote author 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.610
 really is an experienced already wrote 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.160
 several other books 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.830
 this one has already received some prizes 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.070
 I do not know I at the end of the book. 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.440
 aristotle is 17 and you see how 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.760
 his vision is to really discover the 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.190
 secrets of the universe that he really 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.110
 got to discover and discover the father 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.510
 his mother all the problems that 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.370
 he has throughout the book are solved 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.740
 in the end in a way that is nothing 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.890
 man who knows the end he is not so 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.390
 predictable so anyway you imagine 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.070
 what can happen but also 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.830
 think it can not happen that 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.350
 certain thing is not so obvious 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.550
 Any of the endings are good for you and 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.890
 I could not play in the end 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.560
 absolutely nothing that this book has 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.270
 sin I think there is nothing that 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.190
 He could have taken what was 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.100
 something necessary that has remained 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.100
 lacking in explanation he is very well 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.260
 done very well done so this is it 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.260
 The book obviously received a note 5 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.539
 and if you can afford to buy 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.940
 book in English and leave comments 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.310
 What did you think when you tried? 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.260
 not even if you have already joined 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.730
 I also loved talking to you 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.950
 I can not wait to finally find 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.870
 someone who also gave you a book then 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.870
 This is a kiss and by now
