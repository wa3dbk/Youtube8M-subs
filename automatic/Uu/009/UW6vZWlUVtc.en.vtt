00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.759
 Please pay attention to the left side of the palette 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:12.110
 Could you confirm the high laser light 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:17.230
 Thus performing the set and the recognition of the work at the same time 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.230
 The type which blooms is shortened and productivity improves 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:25.610
 Then , based on the recognized work no 1 municipal administration information, the robot will carry it out 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.220
 Set of work As you can see was completed 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.360
 Good 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:46.470
 Not only is it possible to recognize the work by using the original eye 3 d 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.470
 Robots also keep the hunt from contacting other work or pallets 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:56.180
 It is also possible to do pitching 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.180
 Such interference check function is a function unique to Yaskawa Electric that knows the robot 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.620
 Yet another Tri 3 d is compliant with it 54 in an environment system 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.620
 You do not need a person who has for at all to the environment 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.880
 It was possible to prepare with the robot until it could be welded 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880
 Hmm 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.890
 Continue to the right side towards you 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 Auto ma 1400 and the new four-point Benkei 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:35.010
 Please see the actual welding demonstration by Welt r 350 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 Yaskawa Electric is ahead of the industry in development area in charge of welding this time 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.430
 Now it has become the standard for arc welding robots 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.210
 The latest robot with built-in torch cable 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.240
 The automa ama is 400 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 And the welding total in the new welding was developed each time this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 I will use the world r l 350 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.540
 In this demonstration, two major welds will be made at locations assuming automotive underbody parts 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 Do 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:12.069
 In the past, it was co2 welding that was avoided by generating solar spatter. 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.140
 If you already use the trade rl 350 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.350
 Conventional can realize stop pad welding of MAG welding navigation 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.400
 Then we will actually use section from no 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.400
 Please be careful not to look at the bad mouth as it is strong or Tokine 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:46.640
 Buramayo to low-cost two main welding in despite of the conventional bug welding comparable to that carried out 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.640
 I think that we can confirm that welding with very little spatter has been realized 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:00.240
 Robot controller all throat r 350 is of the set to stop anymore 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:04.350
 It becomes possible to operate from dx 100 programming pentane 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.010
 It operability has been significantly appeared 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:14.040
 In addition to the review of corporate structure cooling structure 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:19.810
 It becomes possible to switch to 400V without looking at the input power supply voltage. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.350
 It can be used not only in Japan but also in Asian countries . 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.830
 Said in here was booth 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:34.960
 The new welding power source realized that there was an appearance of reliability 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.960
 We have proposed a solution by robot system using 3 or more production
