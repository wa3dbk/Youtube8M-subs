and just attack him now the only real

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.730 
and just attack him now the only real
problem<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.310> he<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.409> good

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
problem is that he has some really good

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
problem is that he has some really good
evasion<00:01:17.340> skills<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.299> roll<00:01:18.720> through<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> ton

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
evasion skills he can roll through a ton

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.480 
evasion skills he can roll through a ton
of<00:01:19.470> stuff<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:21.229> be<00:01:22.229> prepared<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:23.070> miss<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
of stuff so be prepared to maybe miss a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.210 
of stuff so be prepared to maybe miss a
few<00:01:23.759> times<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.530> keep<00:01:25.680> trying<00:01:25.740> you'll

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
few times but if you keep trying you'll

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
few times but if you keep trying you'll
get<00:01:26.369> him<00:01:26.490> you'll<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.880> him

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
get him you'll get him

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
get him you'll get him
I<00:01:28.460> recommend<00:01:29.460> hitting<00:01:30.060> only<00:01:30.570> once<00:01:31.189> -<00:01:32.189> maybe

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I recommend hitting only once - maybe

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.179 
I recommend hitting only once - maybe
one<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.509> times<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.619> best<00:01:34.979> because

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
one to two times would be best because

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
one to two times would be best because
if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.390> hang<00:01:36.570> around<00:01:36.600> too<00:01:36.960> long<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.409> gonna

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
if you hang around too long you're gonna

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
if you hang around too long you're gonna
get<00:01:37.740> smashed<00:01:38.220> by<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> other<00:01:38.759> two<00:01:39.000> there<00:01:39.630> they

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
get smashed by the other two there they

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
get smashed by the other two there they
might<00:01:40.110> even<00:01:40.200> backstab<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.159> does<00:01:41.400> so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
might even backstab you which does so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
might even backstab you which does so
much<00:01:41.759> damage<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.780> Varg<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.470> stabs<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
much damage it if Varg back stabs you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219 
much damage it if Varg back stabs you
you<00:01:44.189> pretty<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:45.000> dead<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.899> it

Mark are usually like just grouped

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.670 
Mark are usually like just grouped
together<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.840> be<00:03:49.959> kind<00:03:50.169> of<00:03:50.230> tricky<00:03:50.410> you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
together so it can be kind of tricky you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.909 
together so it can be kind of tricky you
want<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:50.980> try<00:03:51.669> to<00:03:51.730> space<00:03:52.000> them<00:03:52.209> out<00:03:52.329> if<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.569> can

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
want to try to space them out if you can

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.559 
want to try to space them out if you can
use<00:03:53.919> blind<00:03:54.250> spots<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.849> just<00:03:55.090> did<00:03:55.269> there

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
use blind spots like I just did there

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.930 
use blind spots like I just did there
that<00:03:56.169> spot<00:03:56.799> up<00:03:56.980> there<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.519> there's<00:03:57.669> a<00:03:57.730> few

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
you want and then just jump off the edge

you want and then just jump off the edge
and<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:08.169> enemies<00:04:08.530> they<00:04:08.680> don't<00:04:08.859> jump<00:04:09.129> off<00:04:09.280> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.050 
and the enemies they don't jump off the
edge<00:04:09.579> after<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:10.569> not<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.410> there<00:04:11.620> at<00:04:11.739> least

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
edge after you so not up there at least

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.309 
edge after you so not up there at least
they<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.359> walk<00:04:13.569> back<00:04:13.750> down<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.109> pathway

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
they have to walk back down the pathway

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.189 
they have to walk back down the pathway
for<00:04:14.769> whatever<00:04:15.220> reason<00:04:15.820> because<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.539> puts<00:04:17.139> the

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
for whatever reason because it puts the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.159 
for whatever reason because it puts the
AIS<00:04:17.739> on<00:04:18.009> Rails<00:04:18.310> essentially<00:04:19.000> so

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
I didn't want to do that because that

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.860 
I didn't want to do that because that
dragon<00:05:28.449> tooth<00:05:28.599> does<00:05:28.779> a<00:05:28.810> lot<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.050> damage<00:05:29.199> so

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
dragon tooth does a lot of damage so

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.360 
dragon tooth does a lot of damage so
yeah<00:05:31.870> now<00:05:32.259> when<00:05:32.500> it's<00:05:32.650> just<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:32.979> and<00:05:33.009> Varg

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.079 
yeah now when it's just you and Varg
comes<00:05:33.819> down<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.710> just<00:05:35.710> back<00:05:36.009> stabs<00:05:36.370> backstabs

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
comes down to just back stabs backstabs

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.969 
comes down to just back stabs backstabs
and<00:05:37.270> parries<00:05:37.479> I<00:05:37.870> would<00:05:38.500> not<00:05:38.740> recommend

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
and parries I would not recommend

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.119 
and parries I would not recommend
attacking<00:05:39.879> normally<00:05:40.599> because<00:05:41.020> his<00:05:41.529> poise<00:05:41.830> is

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
attacking normally because his poise is

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.529 
attacking normally because his poise is
just<00:05:42.339> too<00:05:42.490> much<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:43.000> he's<00:05:43.120> gonna<00:05:43.240> break

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
just too much and he's gonna break

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:44.790 
just too much and he's gonna break
through<00:05:43.779> it's<00:05:44.080> gonna<00:05:44.169> break<00:05:44.409> right<00:05:44.440> through

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
through it's gonna break right through

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.769 
through it's gonna break right through
and<00:05:44.979> hit<00:05:45.069> you<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:46.000> and<00:05:46.479> then<00:05:46.599> you're<00:05:46.690> gonna

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
and hit you so and then you're gonna

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.149 
and hit you so and then you're gonna
take<00:05:46.990> more<00:05:47.199> damage<00:05:47.560> because<00:05:47.680> you're<00:05:47.919> in<00:05:48.039> the

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
take more damage because you're in the

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.429
