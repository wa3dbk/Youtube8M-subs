it<00:00:05.730> sounds<00:00:06.060> silly<00:00:06.240> but<00:00:06.509> one<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> most

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
it sounds silly but one of the most

it sounds silly but one of the most
important<00:00:07.410> things<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.429> really

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
important things you can do is is really

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.049 
important things you can do is is really
handle<00:00:09.450> these<00:00:09.570> patients<00:00:10.110> gently<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.059> I've

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
handle these patients gently and I've

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.430 
handle these patients gently and I've
been<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> lot<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> rescues<00:00:13.019> where<00:00:13.170> people

been on a lot of rescues where people
get<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:13.620> excited<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:15.420> severely

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
get really excited and a severely

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.920 
get really excited and a severely
hypothermic<00:00:16.020> patient<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:17.630> picked<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:18.900> a

these<00:00:21.420> patients<00:00:21.930> gently<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:23.310> don't

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
these patients gently and I don't

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
these patients gently and I don't
believe<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.730> helicopters<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.779> always<00:00:25.260> the

they<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.480> dangerous<00:00:27.769> but

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
they can be really dangerous but

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.500 
they can be really dangerous but

handle<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.280> gently<00:00:47.539> well<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.660> you're<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
handle them gently well if you're a

intravenous fluids if you have them and

intravenous fluids if you have them and
the<00:00:55.440> amount<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:56.699> no<00:00:56.940> absolute<00:00:57.239> consensus

hundred to a thousand cc's of
crystalloid<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:04.619> question<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.369> fluid

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
crystalloid the question is what fluid

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
crystalloid the question is what fluid
and<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.290> theoretical

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and there's some theoretical

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
and there's some theoretical
consideration<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> hypothermic<00:01:10.049> liver

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
consideration that the hypothermic liver

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859 
consideration that the hypothermic liver
does<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.799> metabolize<00:01:11.310> lactate<00:01:11.820> very<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
does not metabolize lactate very well so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
does not metabolize lactate very well so
using<00:01:13.619> something<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.920> normal<00:01:14.310> sailing<00:01:14.700> or

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
using something like normal sailing or

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.899 
using something like normal sailing or
maybe<00:01:15.000> even<00:01:15.060> better<00:01:15.420> d5<00:01:16.350> normal<00:01:16.950> saline<00:01:17.250> give

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
maybe even better d5 normal saline give

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
maybe even better d5 normal saline give
these<00:01:18.060> patients<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.659> sugar<00:01:19.220> it's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
these patients a little sugar it's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
these patients a little sugar it's
probably<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> best<00:01:21.000> choice<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> don't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
probably the best choice well you don't

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
probably the best choice well you don't
want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> give<00:01:23.000> intravenous<00:01:24.000> ice<00:01:24.210> cubes<00:01:24.540> but

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
want to give intravenous ice cubes but

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
want to give intravenous ice cubes but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what most search and rescue groups do is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
what most search and rescue groups do is
they<00:01:27.210> carry<00:01:27.770> intravenous<00:01:28.770> bags<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.369> their

skin and your skin temperatures usually

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
skin and your skin temperatures usually
in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> mid<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> high<00:01:32.040> 80s<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.970> these

patients with severe hypothermia have

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
patients with severe hypothermia have
core<00:01:35.970> temperatures<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.170> typically<00:01:37.619> in

core temperatures that are typically in
the<00:01:37.829> 80s<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.090> patients<00:01:39.509> need

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the 80s and I think these patients need

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.270 
the 80s and I think these patients need
a<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.140> bit<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> volume<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.189> I'm

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
a little bit of volume more than I'm

a little bit of volume more than I'm
worried<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:42.329> theoretical<00:01:43.200> decrease

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
worried about some theoretical decrease

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.399 
worried about some theoretical decrease
in<00:01:44.040> their<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.610> their<00:01:45.270> core<00:01:45.479> temperature<00:01:45.990> which

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
in their in their core temperature which

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
in their in their core temperature which
probably<00:01:46.649> won't<00:01:46.950> happen<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.520> your

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
probably won't happen because your

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
probably won't happen because your
fluids<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.420> probably<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:49.049> their<00:01:49.259> core

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
fluids are probably at their core

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.740 
fluids are probably at their core
temperature<00:01:49.890> anyway<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:51.030> you've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.329> oxygen

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
temperature anyway if you've got oxygen

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.350 
temperature anyway if you've got oxygen
I<00:01:52.110> would<00:01:52.439> definitely<00:01:52.920> give<00:01:53.100> oxygen<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I would definitely give oxygen if the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.440 
I would definitely give oxygen if the

patient shows indications for intubation

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
patient shows indications for intubation
you<00:01:57.810> should<00:01:57.990> intubate<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> some<00:01:59.430> people

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you should intubate them and some people

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
you should intubate them and some people
worry<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.079> intubation<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.590> stimulate

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
worry that intubation could stimulate

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.069 
worry that intubation could stimulate
and<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:03.450> cause<00:02:03.750> ventricular
