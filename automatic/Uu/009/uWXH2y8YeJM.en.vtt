 install a program on your computer 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.140
 and then you give up you say something that is there but this program 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 did not want to have it installed if you create a restore point 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 before speaking that program 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.749
 You can send this time to your system, right? 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.100
 it will restore your system with the same settings as before 

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:02.149
 he was or 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.680
 it will have to be automatically that program that you did not want 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.750
 have spoken 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.810
 which is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.240
 that's it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.960
 Do you believe in end of contract or avoid 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 you come here an allowance that system and security 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.460
 then the secretariat in a system 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.550
 sister 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.100
 nor did he know that on the left and that side of that product the panel he

 the current date date is automatically added 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:36.910
 It is here, for example, that attacked because on my computer it was 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.449
 It's the time 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.639

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.560
 'memorial 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 at the time you send it with my system this time 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.780
 it will restore from this date of this time 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.249
 will vote the same settings 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.769
 that I am now at this very moment in these acts, according to the child's birth 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.560

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.749
 I opened this little box here. 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.809
 and will train up creating a point from him 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.419
 if you save it for a few seconds 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.749
 that the elderly created restore point for you 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:36.359
 what

 hockey per restore point is already played 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.690
 now 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.439
 let's just imagine 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.089
 other brothers egeac image you

 and allows 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.609
 was that certain program on my computer can install itself more 1 1 a 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.910
 much more efficient and secure way 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.289
 are you restoring your system you have already created the restore point of the 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.269
 now 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.650
 You go there 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.919
 in the start menu again 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.729
 meeting panel the link is there 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.819
 system and security 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:30.710
 which is 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.759
 the sicredi has system 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.520
 there again 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.740
 same way 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.639
 system protection is ok 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.900
 now you will send 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.180

 our box that you closed with what you click here 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.369
 that's what he's going to look for 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.520
 normally 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.970
 You're always asking me 'are you warning if you really want 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.700
 to make it come to the surface is once 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.670
 system installation is started can not be interrupted sometimes I 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.869
 were going to continue 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:26.009
 in my case it is that I will not continue but you can click on top continues 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.530

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.580
 and will remove that program that programmed 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.529
 that you did not want to have installed the ocde 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.569
 this is what is a 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.400
 a restore point 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.819
 so this is where you create a pum a restore point is not 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.009

 from that point 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.439
 ocde will also reset everything 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:58.219
 and your with the computer where to stay with the same settings that fabric 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.610
