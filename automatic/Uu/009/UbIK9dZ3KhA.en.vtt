00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello together because of the film factory it 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.950
 is again a new episode 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.779
 movie what for you the last in this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.820
 year but this time again 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.800
 moderately interesting and sugar jennifer 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.019
 Lawrence has gone back to the news 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.019
 deleted as the whole looks the same 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.920
 sony pictures gets this whole 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 like the interview, do not worry about the movie 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 completely out of the press after he 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 movie city in america has been canceled 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 now also reads sony pictures 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 germany announce it will be for the time being 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 Do not want to give a movie city itself 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.309
 Do not comment on whether this movie ever 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 is shown at the same time but says one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.059
 lawyer of sony pictures of this movie 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.960
 will someday be the light of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 to behold the world 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 we can be curious, we have then 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.980
 By the way, already seen and if you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.719
 be sure to have a review on the film 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 Want to write it in any case in the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 I have comments right now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 extremely restrained a bit but 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 we were actually allowed to see him 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 So if you have that, we'll write it in 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 the comments as well as the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 opinion on this whole thing would be 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 you bring out the movie if you like that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 Niewerth or if you were It's also only 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 once carefully think about it on everyone 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.539
 case a matter we are discussing 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.479
 can and where do we do that of course 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.640
 in the comments long it was unclear whether 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.170
 it is a new transformers part of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.150
 new occupation at all 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 after he probably also mark 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 Wahlberg again counted the little ones 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 after of course this fourth 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.759
 Partly again successful 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 was he now announcing yes I was 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.590
 definitely in a fifth part 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 and I also like to see if michael bay 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 even now the fifth time one already 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.829
 likes to stage two styles 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.720
 By the way, not yet fixed but there too 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.150
 I assume that at 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.009
 the same gage the lust for everyone 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.540
 case can be increased by you 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.110
 I would like to know he still needs 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 once a fifth time the transformers 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.860
 destroy everything and in the end it will be 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 but all right or you have on 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.920
 then enough of this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.920
 franchise writes that too 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.409
 yes, this year were a few coaches 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.960
 properly held by the blanket too 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.829
 you clicked hard and all two 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.750
 It was different somehow during the weeks 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.759
 average to the height of the new trailer 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.229
 I'm looking forward to the movie this year 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.359
 but most of it has malware 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.060
 convinced with you I mean the whole 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.190
 93 million times was in this world 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.430
 Trailer accessed on the internet close 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.170
 followed by star wars with 81 million 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 awakening is the power too 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.030
 not so long outside and avengers 2 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.709
 with 78 million so were trailer 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.269
 really very popular this year 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.120
 and I would like to know from you 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.560
 all this trailer wave what has you 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.660
 maybe the most liked 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.519
 not what is so popular what is yours 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.349
 I've been my favorite trailer 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.110
 pretty curious what is in there 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.310
 to read comments jennifer 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.019
 lawrence has this incredible 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.079
 but much also reaches her figure 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.819
 knowledge from the tribute of panem is 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.470
 still very successful she is 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.049
 now even been issued as 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 wax figure in the museum madame tussauds 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 in London is very well known so 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.180
 You can go there now and run 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.430
 direction photos but also with 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.810
 knowledge that also carries a quiver with 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.280
 very many arrow you can too 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 make a quick sign 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.630
 to be rebellion so already gone 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.329
 that figure is now the crowds like that 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
 has moved that they now have a in 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.510
 this museum already stands for that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.500
 That's why you would be lost 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.239
 travel london 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.850
 It is always worth a trip but only 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.160
 I doubt it to see this figure 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.180
 but if it does write that too 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.709
 in the comments today one is 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.340
 comment special you can do everything 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.040
 Leave a Comment 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.690
 I think we're good for the little one 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.459
 speed date what actually starts this 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.319
 week on the first christmas day in our 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.209
 I do not have any cinemas with honey in my head 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.889
 seen because til silent the press 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.510
 do not be informed about it 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.940
 I can not say that accordingly 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.260
 but in third place I would have bibi and 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.150
 tina is fully bewitched so actually 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.530
 no bad not bad 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.030
 call start date I found the movie with 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.889
 Although not outstanding, one can but 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 give if you found the first good 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.310
 just people still so retro temperate 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.470
 on it are and the old times 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.150
 afterwards mourn as I would the 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.250
 filming but rather left to lie 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.530
 but then maybe the discovery 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.959
 infinity beat a movie 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.759
 the overall solid craftsmanship 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.650
 but it has been designed for me 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.580
 a bit too cheesy would like more 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.590
 about the story of stephen hawking 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.880
 actually I do not experience anything I do 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.140
 I did not know that anyway 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.870
 a bit of a shame because of the out 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.430
 I have my 2 in first place then 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.080
 but exodus also a movie of 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.660
 in between, of course, has its lengths 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.019
 but overall it was very convincing 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.790
 just visually just a great one 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.680
 madhouse movie has become and I'm happy 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.090
 me even if he is now almost the same 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.130
 moment in the community preview and 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.690
 Frankfurt with many of you 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.820
 watching the movie are curious as you 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.920
 but the movie is finally there 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.940
 my first recommendation to this film 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.770
 definitely this year 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.560
 or this christmas on 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.090
 to watch every case in the cinema 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.370
 The box office was also this week 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.560
 The box office stormed again worldwide 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.140
 was fantastic and we start with 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.000
 Germany 975 1000 visitors have 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.850
 on thursday friday saturday and 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.590
 sunday the hobbit 3 looked at the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.490
 But the most successful newcomer was at night 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.440
 in the museum 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.600
 he could not top that result 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.120
 with 230,000 visitors but quite 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.550
 solid started and penning in ours 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.770
 sweet little lover who with 210 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.360
 still a really strong place 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.430
 three and I have to be honest too 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.140
 you will admit me holy evening 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.610
 I'll see myself in the cinema then 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.230
 preach also look again 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.060
 We'll look over there for America 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.750
 yes, the hobbit is only this week 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.220
 started namely Wednesday has in five 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.260
 90 million dollars were recorded 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.370
 is also very good from there 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.710
 got started 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.080
 also started there at night 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.570
 museum with scarcely 17 to 18 million 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.160
 dollar sales and also annie's with us 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.650
 now laid from christmas in january 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.690
 There has also been a strong there 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.070
 double-digit result though both 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.110
 films with security far below the 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.030
 expectations are not started but so 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.070
 worldwide what else happened 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.870
 Of course , the hobbit was 105 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.340
 million in total 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.260
 successful when I say worldwide 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.300
 I always mean the results 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.860
 america that when i do it all in all 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.510
 international result is now one 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.710
 but it gets a bit complicated 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.260
 indeed worldwide then too 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.450
 has $ 105 million 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.120
 hobbit recorded there and is whole 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.580
 crazy that a chinese movie is on 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.620
 second place is well over 50 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.410
 million dollar sales would be seen here 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.390
 can be really good but also piquet 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.540
 in india as the most successful film there 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.600
 started and has 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.440
 in america in the top ten arrives 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.990
 is already crazy is the 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.670
 most successful movie of all time from 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.560
 state of america with over three 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.120
 million dollar turnover is so 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.770
 crazy what happened this week 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.120
 I'm curious how the box on 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.400
 This week is still turning though 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.340
 Christmas is a known one 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.900
 very successful weekend and the 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.210
 you're all going to the cinemas, too 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.980
 I'm also curious what I am 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.480
 tell you then in two weeks 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.190
 next week, filming is going on 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.600
 a little christmas holiday you will 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.030
 but here of course with cool daily 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.740
 supplied videos but who says now 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.150
 so good that now everything was up much 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.950
 let's have a look at the video maybe
