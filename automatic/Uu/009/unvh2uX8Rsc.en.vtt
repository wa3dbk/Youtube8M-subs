00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.679
 how to make up a face all red with cheeks well present this is the 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:06.890
 question we asked the makeup artists amalfitano j 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.749
 who deliver us all these little merchant tips 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.719
 we have state that has a round face 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 and to see his face correct he refined and give him a little more 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.039
 character 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.670
 I'm going to proceed in three stages first step all the signs of a 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.279
 angel face with a game of shadows and light 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.640
 for once I'm going to use 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.769
 a modeler the light colors 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.680
 re-inflated parts and dark colors 13 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.040
 when we understood this rule we understood everything to work 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 relief also the maxillary 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.380
 so there I do not pose 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.810
 my shadow 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.170
 savage stone will dig 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.360
 this part 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.240
 and make his face oval 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.680
 I do not forget to go dark hair root 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.410
 manage positively to please them in the center of the forehead for precisely the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.090
 fill in second step 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.450
 in class40 the look for tyrants outside 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.150
 I'm just going to stretch the eye 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.880
 and work the eyebrow he is pulled also a light color 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 especially the entire eyelid 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.480
 bring a point of light 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.740
 so I put the color for the laundry 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.690
 I go a little outside 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.700
 and with a brush I'm going to go 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 degrade the color to have a melted result 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 and I will not accentuate its broken sides 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.240
 extend are sensitive 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.010
 why respect the rule of the perfect face 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.500
 corner of the nose 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.870
 eye corner 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.460
 and are sensitive must stop 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.640
 ie6 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 third step we bring the finishing touches on the letters to harmonize 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.330
 the oval of the face 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.730
 so I'm going to harmonize the voice in such ways so the balanced the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.730
 lower lip to 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.559
 it's beefy I did not cheat at the lower lip level at 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.679
 but on the other hand on the lip 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:24.219
 superior i'm going to work on top so i'm going to degraded the launching itself 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.119
 relative 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.559
 with the help of seeing her for just colorful 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.119
 the texture of the transparent gloss 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.940
 with 35 6 me 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.020
 the morpho makeup of the state refined his face and made him win in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.490
 femininity
