00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.649
 hello everyone I'm creative cynthia smith 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.150
 from the fashion design courses to 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.880
 distance 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 in this video I will tell you about the course 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.410
 of the collection in this biometral case 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.660
 it's more effects and color initial level 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.360
 You can see the lessons introduction 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.340
 as a demonstration so they know 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.340
 better teaching methodology 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.690
 these are the lessons that 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 we will develop in this level of the course 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 geometer them 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.940
 in the first lesson of the course 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 xumetra them more effects and color 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 we will make the base skirt in this 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.629
 introduction we will see the step by step 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.600
 we will observe that we start from a 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.930
 rectangle of the width and total height of the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.619
 skirt we will trace the form from the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.420
 bone molding of the real body and in a 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.960
 principle we will work it in a way 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.780
 geometric 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.420
 then we will shape it and once 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 ended mold to leave the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 turn him into a geometer 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 we will add cuts and seams and for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.000
 last we will also make the back 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 let's begin then with the realization 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 I recommend that you continue to see the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.930
 next video so you know better 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 the themes that develop as 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.850
 also the methodology of teaching by 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 Any questions or queries about the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.940
 courses can be contacted by this means 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.250
 via mail or telephone these are 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.700
 currently all design courses 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.290
 of fashion from a distance that they can acquire 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.920
 thank you very much and I wait for you in the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.920
 next video
