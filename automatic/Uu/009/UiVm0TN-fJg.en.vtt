rendered<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.179> game<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.870> could<00:00:13.019> save

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
rendered in this game as you could save

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.680 
rendered in this game as you could save
so<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.730> tier<00:00:15.030> 2<00:00:15.410> TD<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.980> Germany<00:00:17.690> it's

looks pretty beast it's going to be easy

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
looks pretty beast it's going to be easy
to<00:00:30.330> pen<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.890> take<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> look<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to pen now as we take a look at this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.470 
to pen now as we take a look at this
armor<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.239> 15<00:00:33.780> millimeter<00:00:34.140> thin<00:00:34.620> sheet

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
armor it's all 15 millimeter thin sheet

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
armor it's all 15 millimeter thin sheet
the<00:00:36.480> front<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> tank<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.290> 50<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the front of the tank is 50 which is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.340 
the front of the tank is 50 which is
surprising<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:39.960> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
surprising so is down here which that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
surprising so is down here which that
could<00:00:40.500> withstand<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:41.460> stuff<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.239> was

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
could withstand some stuff that it was

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.889 
could withstand some stuff that it was
sansom<00:00:42.750> punishment<00:00:43.460> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.760> angled<00:00:45.180> pretty

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
sansom punishment this is angled pretty

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.160 
sansom punishment this is angled pretty
ferociously<00:00:46.890> obviously<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> equates<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
ferociously obviously so it equates to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
ferociously obviously so it equates to
around<00:00:49.379> 50<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.520> 15<00:00:51.239> with

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
around 50 but it is actually 15 with

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
around 50 but it is actually 15 with
some<00:00:52.260> tracks<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> front<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.309> counters

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
some tracks on the front which counters

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
some tracks on the front which counters
kind<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> buffers<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:56.180> spaced<00:00:57.180> armor<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.649> side

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
kind of buffers or spaced armor the side

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
kind of buffers or spaced armor the side
is<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.219> 15<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.090> rears<00:01:00.359> 10<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> 15<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is all 15 the rears 10 and 15 in the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
is all 15 the rears 10 and 15 in the
back<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> tank<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
back so this tank is not going to be a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
back so this tank is not going to be a
brawler<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:05.640> knew<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.450> want

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
brawler but we already knew that we want

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.780 
brawler but we already knew that we want
to<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> gun<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.580> we're

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to know about the gun don't we so we're

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.030 
to know about the gun don't we so we're
going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> ammo<00:01:09.390> real<00:01:09.659> quick<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
going to look at the ammo real quick so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
going to look at the ammo real quick so
it<00:01:11.130> has<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> ready<00:01:11.460> rack<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> right<00:01:12.240> side

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it has a ready rack on the right side

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.000 
it has a ready rack on the right side
and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> left<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.650> rounds<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and the left side only two rounds of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.969 
and the left side only two rounds of the
left<00:01:14.159> side<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.540> ammo<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.590> big

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
left side of ammo and it it's big

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
left side of ammo and it it's big
stowage<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
stowage is right to the right of the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.910 
stowage is right to the right of the
driver<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> shouldn't<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
driver so if you shouldn't have this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
driver so if you shouldn't have this
thing<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> front<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.479> if

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
thing from the front right here and if

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.090 
thing from the front right here and if
you're<00:01:21.960> flunking<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.590> try<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.009> on

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you're flunking this thing try to get on

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're flunking this thing try to get on
its<00:01:23.250> left<00:01:23.700> side<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.210> shoot<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.869> down

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
its left side and shoot it right down

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
its left side and shoot it right down
there<00:01:25.320> there's<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.479> stowage<00:01:27.479> along<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
there there's also stowage along the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.830 
there there's also stowage along the
whole<00:01:28.500> bottom<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.549> between<00:01:29.700> both<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
whole bottom and in between both the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
whole bottom and in between both the
loader<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> gunner<00:01:32.750> we're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
loader and the gunner we're going to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.069 
loader and the gunner we're going to
look<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.290> these<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> ammo<00:01:36.509> tickets

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
look at this these are the ammo tickets

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.780 
look at this these are the ammo tickets
so<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.829> PCR<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.670> was

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
so it can get a PCR which I was

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
so it can get a PCR which I was
interested<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.360> which<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> same<00:01:40.170> gun

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
interested in which is the same gun

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.300 
interested in which is the same gun
pretty<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> F<00:01:41.579> 2<00:01:42.680> pans<00:01:43.680> before<00:01:44.040> and
