00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.820
 The liver belongs next to the skin 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.790
 our very big organs she weighs 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.029
 about two kilograms and she is located 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.160
 in the right upper abdomen to the largest 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.170
 part in the right upper abdomen 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.240
 or with her biggest rag 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.019
 in the right upper abdomen and that is the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 the logos hepatitis dexter the right 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.980
 let liver 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.370
 also see in the frontal view 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 we have the left liver rag of the logos 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.530
 hepatitis sinistre these are the two 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.410
 largest of the right ones at all 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.239
 the next big one is the left liver 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.010
 rag and when we get the liver off 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.430
 remove the upper abdomen 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.239
 then we see from below once the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.100
 Globe square foot the name says it was 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.340
 but square this flap is not 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 not at all the lupus square and the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.100
 smallest liver rag that is the lobau 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.560
 datus of the welded or blackened 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.869
 we'd better leave what we also in the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.670
 view the view from below 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.540
 this greenish structure 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.310
 that's the gallbladder the four liver 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.200
 overlap are surrounded by a capsule 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.400
 every single one of a capsule of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.220
 liver capsule 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 that is the anatomical structure of 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.500
 liver therefore has the most sensitive fibers 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.530
 can be sensitive to pain 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.570
 they prefer the liver inner ones 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.610
 liver rag own no own 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.400
 sensitive phases and that means that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 the liver does not hurt is sensitive 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.049
 like no internal organs at all 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.820
 have sensitivity to pain 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.130
 As I said, it is because we are not 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.259
 have sensitive fibers in the organs 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 but if in the right upper abdomen the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.610
 rather hurts then seems to do 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.579
 it is not the liver but it is 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.799
 the liver capsule swelling in the 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.680
 frame an inflammation, for example 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.619
 it gets so tense that we 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.510
 Remember the tension pain and then 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.720
 says one 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.760
 I think the liver as I said 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.680
 Please do not do it the liver 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.680
 but the liver capsule like 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.530
 Gallstones are in our culture 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 pretty common and that has something 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.880
 to do with that the gallstones through 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.370
 various factors are promoted 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.460
 the martin luthers are not yet 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.800
 have played a significant role 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.290
 Gallstones can be made from cholesterol 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.750
 bilirubin or calcium or 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.850
 from mixtures and there is one 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 prerequisite for gallstones 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 the Probability that the awake 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 First of all, inflammation of the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.580
 gall bladder of course then and please 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.790
 Remember it 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:06.500
 inflammations have in addition to the three 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:09.030
 cardinal symptoms cala d'or and heat 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.810
 Pain and redness also affect the tumor 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.180
 swelling but now in the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.950
 relatively fine bile because of 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 then have a swelling 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.120
 can you imagine that the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.370
 bile only harder to drain 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.180
 Inflammations are a risk factor 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.890
 then movement disorders or 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.410
 agility disorder I have to 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.030
 actually say the derivative 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.320
 bile ducts that means the bile ducts 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.830
 surrounded by smooth muscles 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.470
 transport the bile 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.519
 not good and congestion 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.040
 gall congestion is now missing 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.930
 congestion is also a 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.220
 risk factor for the emergence of 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.860
 gallstones suffer 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 and then there is this ominous 5f rule 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.900
 namely, there are five factors 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.140
 which are the result of gallstones 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:21.930
 favor in English 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.930
 forty a human is over 40 years old 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:30.449
 female advantage in pregnancy 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:46.360
 blond and fat overweight that is 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:48.570
 the so-called 5 f the one gallstones 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.729
 favor education 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.130
 and finally you have to say 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.849
 actually a sixth f to do so 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.550
 namely gallstones are given 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.380
 Familiar with the 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.009
 If you know your parents 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.090
 one of her parents or grandparents 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.030
 They had to have gallstones on it 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.310
 Make sure that you do not own one too 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.039
 set out gallstone development 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.199
 when gallstones can develop 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.310
 then it says 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:27.940
 so-called continents are formed 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:30.580
 the risk groups cholesterol that 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:39.159
 means a hyper cholesterol emi 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:44.940
 favors gallstones bilirubin 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:47.949
 the blood breakdown and calcium 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.500
 Now you could say a blanket worry 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.810
 always ask for these substances 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.789
 transported in time with the gala 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.169
 But now there will be her 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.430
 Patients, of course, ask how should I 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.800
 I should do that so small 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.110
 Friedchen pure to pull out 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.320
 no, there is a very simple thing 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.699
 which promotes the bile secretion and 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.099
 Although that is the intake and 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.520
 Regular regular consumption of 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:15.520
 so-called amara namely bitter substances 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.270
 where do we have bitter substances in many 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.270
 our native
