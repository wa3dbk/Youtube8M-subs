let's<00:01:50.350> look<00:01:50.530> at<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.710> events<00:01:50.799> leading<00:01:51.220> up<00:01:51.429> to

let's look at the events leading up to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.730 
let's look at the events leading up to
this<00:01:51.729> tragic<00:01:52.090> incident<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.960> see<00:01:53.470> how<00:01:53.619> it

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
this tragic incident and see how it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.190 
this tragic incident and see how it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.590 
could have been prevented the roof
already<00:01:56.709> had<00:01:56.920> guardrails<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.270> employer

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
already had guardrails so the employer

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
