um this is my special base floatzel the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.380 
um this is my special base floatzel the
first<00:01:38.950> turn<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.310> was<00:01:39.429> thinking<00:01:39.700> well<00:01:39.850> he<00:01:40.179> could

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
first turn I was thinking well he could

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.969 
first turn I was thinking well he could
heat<00:01:40.600> wait<00:01:40.810> or<00:01:40.990> he<00:01:41.140> could<00:01:41.289> discharge<00:01:41.530> an

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
heat wait or he could discharge an

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.309 
heat wait or he could discharge an
earthquake<00:01:42.490> because<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.929> know<00:01:44.050> it's<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
earthquake because you know it's a

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.800 
earthquake because you know it's a
pretty<00:01:44.649> common<00:01:45.280> combo<00:01:45.880> nowadays<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.660> lot

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
pretty common combo nowadays and a lot

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.180 
pretty common combo nowadays and a lot
of<00:01:46.840> people<00:01:47.140> like<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.319> do<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.679> so<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.100> that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
of people like to do that so for that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.919 
of people like to do that so for that
reason<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.640> didn't<00:01:48.970> switch<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.420> electivire

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
reason I didn't switch to electivire

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.469 
reason I didn't switch to electivire
thinking<00:01:50.649> that<00:01:50.770> he<00:01:50.860> might<00:01:50.890> discharge<00:01:51.310> or<00:01:51.880> you

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
thinking that he might discharge or you

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.290 
thinking that he might discharge or you
know<00:01:52.600> or<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.170> charge<00:01:53.830> me<00:01:53.860> Q<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.789> just

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
know or just charge me Q so I just

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.650 
know or just charge me Q so I just
decided<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.810> ice<00:01:56.410> beam<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.890> torterra

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
decided to ice beam this torterra

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.820 
decided to ice beam this torterra
because<00:01:58.660> if<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.959> doesn't<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.259> yeah<00:01:59.470> it's

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
because if it doesn't have yeah it's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.499 
because if it doesn't have yeah it's
gonna<00:01:59.979> die<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.459> if<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.640> does<00:02:00.789> have<00:02:00.910> yeah<00:02:01.149> it's

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
gonna die and if it does have yeah it's

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.900 
gonna die and if it does have yeah it's
probably<00:02:01.959> going<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.350> die<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:03.100> because<00:02:03.340> it's

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
probably going to die just because it's

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.719 
probably going to die just because it's
a<00:02:04.030> torterra<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.780> they<00:02:05.649> can't<00:02:06.039> take<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.459> step

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
a torterra and they can't take I step

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.940 
a torterra and they can't take I step
attacks<00:02:07.030> at<00:02:07.209> all<00:02:07.330> they're<00:02:07.569> like<00:02:07.920> they're<00:02:08.920> like

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.650 
attacks at all they're like they're like
they<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.490> take<00:02:09.610> ice<00:02:09.819> type<00:02:10.090> attacks<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
they can take ice type attacks like a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.199 
they can take ice type attacks like a
Jew<00:02:11.340> yeah<00:02:12.340> anyhow<00:02:12.850> um<00:02:14.400> um<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.490> don't<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:16.000> what

beam<00:02:19.360> Ben<00:02:19.870> look<00:02:20.200> at<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.950> shot<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> beam

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
beam Ben look at that I just shot a beam

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.180 
beam Ben look at that I just shot a beam
of<00:02:21.940> code<00:02:22.209> energy<00:02:22.660> at<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.200> awesome<00:02:23.770> so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
of code energy at you that's awesome so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.970 
of code energy at you that's awesome so
anyway<00:02:24.459> he<00:02:24.640> dies<00:02:25.110> which<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.230> great<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
anyway he dies which is great so the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.740 
anyway he dies which is great so the
turtle<00:02:27.310> goes<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.670> its<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.209> because<00:02:28.630> we

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
turtle goes on its back and because we

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.540 
turtle goes on its back and because we
like<00:02:28.930> turtles<00:02:29.380> he<00:02:29.830> doesn't<00:02:30.099> actually<00:02:30.220> die

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
like turtles he doesn't actually die

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.559

the<00:03:58.130> Infernape<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:58.820> know<00:03:58.970> get<00:03:59.239> some<00:03:59.420> damage

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
the Infernape you know get some damage

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.180 
the Infernape you know get some damage
on<00:03:59.900> there<00:04:00.140> maybe<00:04:00.320> i'll<00:04:00.500> get<00:04:00.590> some<00:04:00.739> accuracy

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
on there maybe i'll get some accuracy

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.280 
on there maybe i'll get some accuracy
lower<00:04:01.519> that's<00:04:02.030> why<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.269> has<00:04:02.510> mud<00:04:02.780> bomb<00:04:02.989> because

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
lower that's why it has mud bomb because

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.900 
lower that's why it has mud bomb because
it's<00:04:03.500> what<00:04:03.799> thirty<00:04:04.070> percent<00:04:04.340> chance<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.760> lower

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
it's what thirty percent chance to lower

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.360 
it's what thirty percent chance to lower
accuracy<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.780> i<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:06.079> be<00:04:06.470> an<00:04:06.560> accuracy<00:04:06.950> lower<00:04:07.250> a

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
accuracy so i can be an accuracy lower a

so<00:06:27.990> anyway<00:06:28.289> sludge<00:06:28.620> bomb<00:06:28.919> goes<00:06:29.279> off<00:06:29.460> and<00:06:29.669> it

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
so anyway sludge bomb goes off and it

so anyway sludge bomb goes off and it
doesn't<00:06:30.150> kill<00:06:30.330> I<00:06:30.659> mean<00:06:31.080> come<00:06:31.440> on<00:06:31.469> now<00:06:31.830> who<00:06:32.099> runs

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.269 
doesn't kill I mean come on now who runs
bulky<00:06:33.090> Infernape<00:06:33.599> but<00:06:34.199> on<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:34.800> plus<00:06:34.830> side<00:06:35.039> I

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:35.279 
bulky Infernape but on the plus side I

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.339 
bulky Infernape but on the plus side I
get<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.610> poison<00:06:35.789> so<00:06:36.330> you<00:06:36.840> know<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:36.990> guess

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
get the poison so you know I guess

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.140 
get the poison so you know I guess
technically<00:06:37.830> Auerbach<00:06:38.310> did<00:06:38.550> finish<00:06:38.819> it<00:06:38.909> off

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
technically Auerbach did finish it off

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.269 
technically Auerbach did finish it off
so<00:06:39.419> it<00:06:39.599> goes<00:06:39.930> for<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.169> flare<00:06:40.380> blitz<00:06:40.590> which<00:06:41.099> is

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:41.279 
so it goes for the flare blitz which is

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.909 
so it goes for the flare blitz which is
very<00:06:41.610> strange<00:06:42.029> I<00:06:42.270> have<00:06:42.990> mixtapes<00:06:43.590> don't
