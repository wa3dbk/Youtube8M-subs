00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.100
 to improve the response capacity 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.960
 in emergencies that occur in the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 cabildo community the firemen of that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.490
 city have a new car 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.140
 rescue with an approximate cost of 10 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.360
 thousand pesos 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.310
 is the commune of cabildo has increased the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.350
 automotive park but this too 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720
 carries with it the increase of accidents 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.270
 Vehicles on roads and roads 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.660
 from that commune and constantly firefighters 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.310
 of that city must resort to the rescue 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.619
 this is why today firefighters has 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.780
 a new rescue car which is coming 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.180
 to replace an adapted ambulance 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.460
 for the occasion we got this to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 usa through which arrived this day 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.670
 Saturday at the port of San Antonio is a 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.930
 truck can say a model by 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.629
 brand ford model f 450 with the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.329
 diesel fuel and which also with 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.219
 automatic transmission which as 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.809
 you can see it already has a great 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.149
 amount of compartment a large 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.670
 amount of spaces we can 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.770
 place our equipment and it's also going 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.150
 to help as I say to be able to attend 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 great need that we have for 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.360
 the emergency that we serve this commune 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.310
 as I was telling you, it's the patients 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.140
 Vehicles that have gone in a lot of increase 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.120
 in this last time 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.090
 was generated through a project with the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.500
 municipality which injures a contribution 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.930
 also for the purchase of this unit 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.760
 The idea was to buy a vehicle 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.890
 ambulance type to be able to issue here 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.050
 for the reality that our commune has 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.550
 since our commune always lacks the 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.380
 Ambulance issue not to the best 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.390
 now why not because there is not the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100
 hospital ambulance but because 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.380
 the long distance we have from the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.869
 transfer of the injured from this 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 hospital are very long then they take 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.600
 the arrival of the ambulance 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.490
 timely back to our 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 hospital that's why the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.570
 need for us to count 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.070
 with a unit that also has the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.020
 possibility therefore to transfer patients and 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.700
 support the hospital and that until this 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 moment we have been doing it for 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 all these years satisfied and happy 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.149

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.090
 that city with this new acquisition 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.789
 that had an approximate cost of 10 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.380
 millions of pesos like you can 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.720

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.670
 the new rescue car that counts 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.860
 now the cabildo fire brigade 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.450
 these last few years there have been many 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.950

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.150
