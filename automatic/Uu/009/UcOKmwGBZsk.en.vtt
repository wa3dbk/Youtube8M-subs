actually been very clinical at times
with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> defending<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> I've<00:01:01.559> given<00:01:01.980> him<00:01:02.070> 78

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
with the defending and I've given him 78

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
with the defending and I've given him 78
which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> also<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.480> same<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.870> last<00:01:04.019> year<00:01:04.290> yeah

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
which is also the same as last year yeah

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
which is also the same as last year yeah
it's<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.280> 81<00:01:05.700> pace<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> bit<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> an

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's got 81 pace which is bit of an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's got 81 pace which is bit of an
improvement<00:01:07.049> i<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.740> by<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:08.369> he's<00:01:08.850> also

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
improvement i think by three he's also

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
improvement i think by three he's also
got<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.450> defending<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:09.990> 78<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> even

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
got right defending at 78 and even

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.940 
got right defending at 78 and even
passing<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:11.970> 77<00:01:12.630> he's<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:12.810> alright<00:01:12.960> player<00:01:13.500> but

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
passing at 77 he's an alright player but

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
passing at 77 he's an alright player but
that's<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.490> class<00:01:14.850> him<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that's all I can class him as right I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
that's all I can class him as right I
don't<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.290> he's<00:01:16.409> actually<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.100> great<00:01:17.460> on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
don't think he's actually that great on

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
don't think he's actually that great on
into<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> next<00:01:18.750> player<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> Michael

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
into the next player it is Michael

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.420 
into the next player it is Michael
Dawson<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.970> yet<00:01:21.810> again<00:01:21.930> guy<00:01:22.740> who's<00:01:23.040> not

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
Dawson now yet again guy who's not

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
Dawson now yet again guy who's not
really<00:01:23.580> improved<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.360> last<00:01:24.420> season<00:01:25.049> I've

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
really improved from last season I've

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
really improved from last season I've
kept<00:01:25.560> him<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.799> 81<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
kept him an 81 I think that's what it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.969 
kept him an 81 I think that's what it
was<00:01:27.180> last<00:01:27.450> year<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:28.560> much<00:01:28.740> has<00:01:28.950> changed

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
was last year not much has changed

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
was last year not much has changed
really<00:01:29.700> his<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.570> real<00:01:30.810> pretty<00:01:30.990> poor<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
really his that's real pretty poor in

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
really his that's real pretty poor in
the<00:01:31.530> attacking<00:01:31.799> cents<00:01:32.159> worth<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> giving<00:01:32.729> him

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the attacking cents worth of giving him

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
the attacking cents worth of giving him
82<00:01:33.210> defending<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.810> 82<00:01:34.200> heading<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:35.130> he

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
82 defending an 82 heading I think he

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
82 defending an 82 heading I think he
originally<00:01:35.579> had<00:01:35.729> 80<00:01:35.970> defending<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.079> four

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
originally had 80 defending and a four

he was in the PFA Team of the Year and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
he was in the PFA Team of the Year and
as<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> centre<00:02:03.000> back<00:02:03.030> obviously<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.719> he's<00:02:03.810> done

Tottenham he's actually played

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
Tottenham he's actually played
incredible<00:02:07.799> scored<00:02:08.069> quite<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> few<00:02:08.459> goals<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
as a centre back that is very good I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
as a centre back that is very good I
think<00:02:11.250> he's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> David<00:02:12.060> Luiz<00:02:12.390> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
by three stats from last year I think

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.449 
by three stats from last year I think
I've<00:02:38.930> given<00:02:39.170> him<00:02:39.230> 82<00:02:39.800> reading<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.280> he<00:02:40.340> has

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.550 
I've given him 82 reading because he has
been<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.940> best<00:02:41.180> right<00:02:41.450> backs<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.900> the

been one of the best right backs in the
Premier<00:02:42.890> League<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.160> thought<00:02:43.430> behind<00:02:43.610> zabaleta

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
Premier League I thought behind zabaleta

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.420

this season he's got 91 pace because he

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.449

80 passing 82 dribbling and the
defending<00:03:34.130> stats<00:03:34.370> don't<00:03:34.580> really<00:03:34.850> matter<00:03:35.030> but

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
defending stats don't really matter but

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.449 
defending stats don't really matter but
here's<00:03:35.450> an<00:03:35.570> oval<00:03:35.870> very<00:03:36.290> very<00:03:36.650> good<00:03:36.860> midfielder

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.580 
people's teams especially at the start
of<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.270> year<00:04:38.300> maybe<00:04:38.599> in<00:04:38.780> some<00:04:38.870> budget<00:04:39.379> teams

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
of the year maybe in some budget teams

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.350 
of the year maybe in some budget teams
later<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:40.069> I<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:40.759> would<00:04:40.939> be<00:04:41.060> a<00:04:41.090> fair

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
later on I think that would be a fair

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.510 
later on I think that would be a fair
assumption<00:04:41.719> to<00:04:42.020> make<00:04:42.050> okay<00:04:43.009> now<00:04:43.189> on<00:04:43.219> to<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
assumption to make okay now on to the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.790 
assumption to make okay now on to the
right<00:04:43.699> wing<00:04:43.909> Aaron<00:04:44.330> Lennon<00:04:44.719> 81<00:04:45.199> rate<00:04:45.409> I<00:04:45.590> think

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
right wing Aaron Lennon 81 rate I think

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.469 
right wing Aaron Lennon 81 rate I think
the<00:04:45.919> same<00:04:46.129> as<00:04:46.280> last<00:04:46.310> year<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.879> don't<00:04:47.270> think<00:04:47.419> I've

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
the same as last year I don't think I've

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.999 
the same as last year I don't think I've
actually<00:04:47.599> changed<00:04:47.810> any<00:04:48.379> stats<00:04:48.710> on<00:04:48.860> him

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
actually changed any stats on him

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.439 
actually changed any stats on him
because<00:04:49.159> he<00:04:49.250> was<00:04:49.340> very<00:04:49.669> similar<00:04:49.909> to<00:04:50.060> last<00:04:50.240> year

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
because he was very similar to last year

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.600 
because he was very similar to last year
played<00:04:50.719> very<00:04:51.020> well<00:04:51.259> don't<00:04:51.560> get<00:04:51.710> me<00:04:51.860> wrong<00:04:52.069> very

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
played very well don't get me wrong very

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.429 
played very well don't get me wrong very
good<00:04:52.819> player<00:04:53.030> maybe<00:04:53.300> should<00:04:53.599> be<00:04:53.689> an<00:04:53.780> 82<00:04:54.169> raid

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
good player maybe should be an 82 raid

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.290 
good player maybe should be an 82 raid
but<00:04:54.800> i<00:04:54.830> thought<00:04:55.069> don't<00:04:55.310> really<00:04:55.969> want<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.180> make

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
but i thought don't really want to make

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.670 
but i thought don't really want to make
them<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:56.599> goes<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.930> know<00:04:57.050> tottenham<00:04:57.469> who

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
them that goes you know tottenham who

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.499 
them that goes you know tottenham who
yeah<00:04:58.129> i<00:04:58.159> don't<00:04:58.400> really<00:04:58.580> want<00:04:58.789> increase<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.300> by

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
yeah i don't really want increase in by

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.510 
yeah i don't really want increase in by
that<00:04:59.750> much<00:05:00.050> okay<00:05:00.860> now<00:05:01.009> under<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.340> first

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
that much okay now under the first

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.570 
that much okay now under the first
transferred<00:05:02.060> player<00:05:02.389> i<00:05:02.419> think<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.169> is

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
transferred player i think and that is

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.029 
transferred player i think and that is

this<00:05:07.789> guy's<00:05:07.969> been<00:05:08.210> speculated<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.900> come<00:05:09.169> to

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
this guy's been speculated to come to

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.899 
this guy's been speculated to come to
Tottenham<00:05:09.710> for<00:05:09.860> quite<00:05:10.099> a<00:05:10.129> while<00:05:10.370> now<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.849> I

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
Tottenham for quite a while now and I

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.390 
Tottenham for quite a while now and I
think<00:05:11.210> it's<00:05:11.360> very<00:05:11.389> possible<00:05:11.780> he's<00:05:12.740> very<00:05:13.039> very

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
think it's very possible he's very very

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.740 
think it's very possible he's very very
good<00:05:13.789> player<00:05:14.000> actually<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.539> aeries

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
good player actually in the aeries

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.300 
good player actually in the aeries
physically<00:05:15.229> strong<00:05:15.500> play<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:15.889> I<00:05:16.190> believe

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
physically strong play so I believe

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.899 
physically strong play so I believe
international<00:05:17.090> or<00:05:17.509> something<00:05:17.840> in<00:05:18.610> Brazil<00:05:19.610> and

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
international or something in Brazil and

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.580 
international or something in Brazil and
yeah<00:05:20.330> he's<00:05:20.569> a<00:05:20.599> very<00:05:20.840> good<00:05:20.960> attacking<00:05:21.229> player

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
yeah he's a very good attacking player

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.379 
yeah he's a very good attacking player
83<00:05:22.159> rate<00:05:22.340> I've<00:05:22.550> given<00:05:22.879> him<00:05:22.940> which<00:05:23.090> is<00:05:23.270> I

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
83 rate I've given him which is I

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.480 
83 rate I've given him which is I
believe<00:05:23.419> three<00:05:24.050> up<00:05:24.169> from<00:05:24.379> last<00:05:24.560> year<00:05:24.889> and<00:05:25.039> he's

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
believe three up from last year and he's

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.269 
believe three up from last year and he's
got<00:05:25.639> 87<00:05:26.150> heading<00:05:26.599> 80<00:05:26.810> shooting<00:05:27.379> in<00:05:27.529> 75

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
got 87 heading 80 shooting in 75

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.100 
got 87 heading 80 shooting in 75
dribbling<00:05:28.759> which<00:05:29.210> is<00:05:29.330> actually<00:05:29.449> really<00:05:29.840> good

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
dribbling which is actually really good

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.659 
dribbling which is actually really good
stats<00:05:30.469> and<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.710> think<00:05:30.919> if<00:05:31.009> they<00:05:31.159> had<00:05:31.340> him<00:05:31.490> he'd

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
stats and I think if they had him he'd

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.330 
stats and I think if they had him he'd
be<00:05:31.819> a<00:05:31.849> bit<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.360> better<00:05:32.569> version<00:05:32.840> man

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
be a bit of a better version man

fans<00:05:53.270> why<00:05:53.389> oh<00:05:53.599> no<00:05:53.870> here's<00:05:54.139> our<00:05:54.289> chance<00:05:54.319> of

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
fans why oh no here's our chance of

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.010 
fans why oh no here's our chance of
Champions<00:05:55.250> League<00:05:55.400> on<00:05:55.669> cuz<00:05:56.150> he's<00:05:56.270> really<00:05:56.750> not

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
Champions League on cuz he's really not

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.959 
Champions League on cuz he's really not
necessarily<00:05:57.440> one-man<00:05:57.919> team<00:05:58.190> but<00:05:58.550> he<00:05:58.729> is<00:05:58.759> just

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
necessarily one-man team but he is just

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.180 
necessarily one-man team but he is just
fantastic<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.779> without<00:05:59.960> him<00:06:00.199> I<00:06:00.379> don't<00:06:00.800> think

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
fantastic and without him I don't think

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.680 
fantastic and without him I don't think
