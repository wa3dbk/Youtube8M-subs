wasn't even worried about Katie too much

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.469 
wasn't even worried about Katie too much
as<00:01:27.410> he<00:01:27.560> gets<00:01:27.740> another<00:01:28.039> still<00:01:28.460> second<00:01:28.910> still<00:01:29.210> in

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
as he gets another still second still in

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.320 
as he gets another still second still in
two<00:01:29.720> possessions<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.460> game<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:31.910> far<00:01:32.119> but

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
two possessions in this game so far but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.420 
two possessions in this game so far but
I<00:01:32.539> didn't<00:01:32.750> really<00:01:32.869> fear<00:01:33.229> him<00:01:33.470> too<00:01:33.680> much<00:01:33.830> but<00:01:34.160> I

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
I didn't really fear him too much but I

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.430 
I didn't really fear him too much but I
came<00:01:34.970> into<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.360> game<00:01:35.420> actually<00:01:35.810> fearing<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
came into this game actually fearing the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.070 
came into this game actually fearing the
whole<00:01:36.649> team<00:01:37.009> at<00:01:37.399> like<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.119> its<00:01:38.539> entirety

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
whole team at like in its entirety

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.309 
whole team at like in its entirety
because<00:01:39.470> this<00:01:40.280> game<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:41.360> makes<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.840> Thunder

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
because this game just makes the Thunder

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.499 
because this game just makes the Thunder
so<00:01:42.679> unstoppable<00:01:43.280> kind<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.849> like<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.119> Lakers

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
so unstoppable kind of like the Lakers

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.449 
so unstoppable kind of like the Lakers
but<00:01:45.110> hopefully<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.649> weather<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.160> storm

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
but hopefully I can weather the storm

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.639 
but hopefully I can weather the storm
and<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.729> know<00:01:46.849> when<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.270> game<00:01:47.539> vs<00:01:48.020> kt<00:01:48.289> and
