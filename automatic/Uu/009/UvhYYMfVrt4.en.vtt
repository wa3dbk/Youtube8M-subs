00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
chords and i'm going to apply them in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700 
chords and i'm going to apply them in
the<00:00:38.070> key<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> F<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.390> click<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> link<00:00:39.840> below<00:00:40.140> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the key of F so click the link below so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319 
the key of F so click the link below so
you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> tab<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.579> follow<00:00:41.700> along<00:00:41.879> but

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you can get the tab and follow along but

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.950 
you can get the tab and follow along but
here<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.440> three<00:00:44.180> two<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.270> that's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
here we go one three two and then that's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:07.359 
here we go one three two and then that's
F<00:00:49.170> major<00:00:49.410> G<00:00:50.039> minor<00:00:50.520> becomes<00:00:51.090> three<00:00:51.989> five<00:00:52.350> three

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.679 

and<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:07.609> the<00:01:07.729> D<00:01:07.969> minor<00:01:08.409> is<00:01:09.409> Tammy<00:01:11.259> 12:10<00:01:13.689> and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
and then the D minor is Tammy 12:10 and

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.910 
and then the D minor is Tammy 12:10 and
then<00:01:15.020> he<00:01:15.649> diminished<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.270> can<00:01:17.450> play<00:01:17.719> 12<00:01:18.560> 13<00:01:19.399> 12

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
then he diminished you can play 12 13 12

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.649 
then he diminished you can play 12 13 12
and<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.069> would<00:01:22.219> resolve<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:25.329> discord<00:01:26.329> up<00:01:26.509> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
and that would resolve to discord up the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.849 
and that would resolve to discord up the
octave<00:01:26.810> which<00:01:27.229> would<00:01:27.350> be<00:01:27.439> 13<00:01:27.890> 15<00:01:28.459> 14<00:01:29.619> now<00:01:30.619> one

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
octave which would be 13 15 14 now one

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.289 
octave which would be 13 15 14 now one
of<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> things<00:01:31.250> that's<00:01:31.490> cool<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.909> can<00:01:32.030> of

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
of the things that's cool is you can of

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:43.290 
of the things that's cool is you can of
course<00:01:32.569> play<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.959> ascending<00:01:33.619> descending

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.100 

and<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.920> can<00:01:45.420> arpeggiate<00:01:46.420> them<00:01:46.630> like<00:01:46.930> it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and then you can arpeggiate them like it

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then you can arpeggiate them like it
was<00:01:47.820> where<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.910> can<00:01:49.060> also<00:01:49.270> work<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.750> your

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
was where you can also work on your

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.730 
was where you can also work on your
muting<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.700> just<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.060> fat<00:01:58.450> it's<00:01:58.810> like<00:01:59.080> you

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
muting it's just so fat it's like you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.920 
muting it's just so fat it's like you
own<00:01:59.920> you're<00:02:00.190> only<00:02:00.340> playing<00:02:00.640> three<00:02:01.060> notes<00:02:01.180> you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
own you're only playing three notes you

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.180 
own you're only playing three notes you
know<00:02:02.050> as<00:02:02.170> opposed<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.620> if<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.830> think<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.160> like

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
know as opposed to if you think of like

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.760 
know as opposed to if you think of like
your<00:02:03.520> C<00:02:03.820> chord<00:02:04.120> or<00:02:04.450> something<00:02:05.380> where<00:02:05.560> you're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
your C chord or something where you're

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.250 
your C chord or something where you're
you're<00:02:06.310> playing<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.210> many<00:02:07.330> notes<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.140> know

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
you're playing so many notes you know

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.890 
you're playing so many notes you know
but<00:02:08.800> most<00:02:09.130> extremes<00:02:09.640> but<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.050> cut<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.230> in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
but most extremes but you cut that in

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.870 
but most extremes but you cut that in
and<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.990> almost<00:02:14.140> sounds<00:02:14.770> bigger<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.730> know<00:02:15.850> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and it almost sounds bigger you know I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.520 
and it almost sounds bigger you know I
mean<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.210> this<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.450> something<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.170> this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
mean so this is something that this this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010 
mean so this is something that this this
style<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:18.190> chord<00:02:18.490> voicing<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.060> used<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.720> ton

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
style of chord voicing is used in a ton

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.350 
style of chord voicing is used in a ton
of<00:02:20.050> rhythm<00:02:20.530> playing<00:02:20.770> anyways<00:02:21.400> which<00:02:22.150> we've

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.110 
of rhythm playing anyways which we've
discussed<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.580> let's<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.700> through<00:02:25.000> the
