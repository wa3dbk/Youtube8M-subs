00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
okay now we are making a potato box we

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980 
okay now we are making a potato box we
took<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:17.220> how<00:00:17.789> many<00:00:17.970> how<00:00:18.270> many<00:00:18.300> gallons<00:00:18.660> um<00:00:18.869> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
took up how many how many gallons um is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.679 
took up how many how many gallons um is
this<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> 55<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.240> can't<00:00:21.510> take

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this this is 55 but you just can't take

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.029 
this this is 55 but you just can't take
any<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.140> any<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.500> any<00:00:22.619> size<00:00:23.220> drum<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.640> want

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
any to any to any size drum you want

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.920 
any to any to any size drum you want
done<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> drilled<00:00:26.460> holes<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.480> drainage

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
done we drilled holes in it for drainage

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
done we drilled holes in it for drainage
and<00:00:28.820> now<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> start<00:00:30.449> preparing

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and now we're going to start preparing

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.970 
and now we're going to start preparing
the<00:00:30.900> soil<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> putting<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the soil and putting it in there the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.450 
the soil and putting it in there the
idea<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.989> will<00:00:34.110> put<00:00:34.260> you'll<00:00:35.130> put<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
idea is that you will put you'll put the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.560 
idea is that you will put you'll put the
potatoes<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> certain<00:00:36.750> level<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
potatoes at it at a certain level as the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
potatoes at it at a certain level as the
potato<00:00:39.570> stems<00:00:39.809> rise<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> keep

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
potato stems rise you're going to keep

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.610 
potato stems rise you're going to keep
adding<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.059> soil<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.690> eventually

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
adding more and more soil and eventually

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.600 
adding more and more soil and eventually
what<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> whole

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
what we're going to have is a whole

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
what we're going to have is a whole
barrel<00:00:45.180> full<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> potatoes<00:00:46.649> how<00:00:47.160> long<00:00:47.340> will

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
barrel full of potatoes how long will

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.380 
barrel full of potatoes how long will
that<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:49.100> like<00:00:50.100> four<00:00:50.399> months<00:00:50.579> four<00:00:51.360> months

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that take like four months four months

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.119 
that take like four months four months
at<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> point<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> point<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> just

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
at that point at that point you just

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.330 
at that point at that point you just
knock<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> barrel<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.719> you'll<00:00:55.050> have

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
knock over the barrel and you'll have

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.040 
knock over the barrel and you'll have
money<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:56.820> many<00:00:56.879> potato<00:00:57.449> plant<00:00:57.780> dies

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
money but how many potato plant dies

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
money but how many potato plant dies
back<00:00:58.469> completely<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.370> we'll<00:00:59.879> knock<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> over

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
back completely then we'll knock it over

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
back completely then we'll knock it over
so<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.260> once<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> stem<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> top<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> will

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
so when once the stem is on top of will

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
so when once the stem is on top of will
ya<00:01:03.629> turn<00:01:04.229> around

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
ya turn around

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.760 
ya turn around
totally<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.339> done<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.560> knock<00:01:07.560> over

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
totally then you're done and knock over

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
totally then you're done and knock over
the<00:01:08.010> barrel<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> you'll<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.840> probably

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the barrel and you'll have probably

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
the barrel and you'll have probably
hundreds<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> potatoes<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.770> guessing<00:01:12.140> all

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hundreds of potatoes I'm guessing all

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.520 
hundreds of potatoes I'm guessing all
right

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
right

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
right
so<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> barrel<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.659> top<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so we put the barrel on top of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
so we put the barrel on top of
cinderblocks<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.460> allow<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> water<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> drain

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
cinderblocks to allow the water to drain

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.609 
cinderblocks to allow the water to drain
and<00:01:20.210> also<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> slight<00:01:21.900> angle<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and also put it at a slight angle so it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.040 
and also put it at a slight angle so it
gets<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.040> Sun

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.040 

we<00:01:31.050> just<00:01:31.260> put<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:32.010> compost<00:01:33.050> organic

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
we just put up some compost organic

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.710 
we just put up some compost organic
compost<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.170> half<00:01:37.560> quarters<00:01:38.390> next<00:01:39.390> some

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
compost and like half quarters next some

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.340 
compost and like half quarters next some
horse<00:01:39.990> bedding<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:42.120> can<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.450> whatever<00:01:42.630> soil

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
all right this thing's bagging the cubic

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.590 
all right this thing's bagging the cubic
foot<00:02:09.690> foot<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:12.110> around<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:14.330> about<00:02:15.330> less

than half of that bag in the minerals

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.310 
than half of that bag in the minerals
aeration<00:02:22.550> that's<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> third<00:02:24.980> okay<00:02:27.320> don't

breathe that not as bad as her life all
right<00:02:38.610> now<00:02:38.850> you're<00:02:39.090> gonna<00:02:39.150> mix<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.510> her<00:02:39.630> own

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.910 

we're<00:02:44.190> using<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.910> break<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> mix<00:02:46.709> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
we're using it to break up the mix of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.820 
we're using it to break up the mix of
soil<00:02:47.130> inside<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> bucket<00:02:51.350> also<00:02:52.350> added<00:02:52.590> worm

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
soil inside the bucket also added worm

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.630 
soil inside the bucket also added worm
castings<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:56.640> makes<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.090> vermicompost

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
natural mulch in the forest probably has

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.870 
natural mulch in the forest probably has
a<00:03:09.480> lot<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.660> minerals<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> stuff<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:10.880> in

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
a lot of minerals and stuff in there in

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
a lot of minerals and stuff in there in
more<00:03:12.269> than<00:03:12.420> minerals<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.019> more

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
more than minerals it's more

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.680 
more than minerals it's more

horse<00:03:15.959> leg<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:18.269> him<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.660> here<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.049> helps

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
horse leg so this him in here it helps

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.149 
horse leg so this him in here it helps
with<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> potatoes

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.509 

what's<00:03:25.159> that

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
what's that

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.199 
what's that
gypsum<00:03:26.290> salt<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.590> mean<00:03:28.129> rock<00:03:28.310> rock<00:03:28.640> dust<00:03:28.909> crack

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
gypsum salt I mean rock rock dust crack

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.020 
gypsum salt I mean rock rock dust crack
this<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.659> little<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.189> calcium<00:03:31.189> and<00:03:31.489> sulfur

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
this a little bit of calcium and sulfur

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.789 
this a little bit of calcium and sulfur
for<00:03:32.689> minerals<00:03:35.409> probably<00:03:36.409> shouldn't<00:03:36.590> inhale

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
for minerals probably shouldn't inhale

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.839 
for minerals probably shouldn't inhale
that<00:03:36.950> Oh<00:03:37.159> No<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:39.680> I'm<00:03:39.799> putting<00:03:39.829> peat<00:03:40.250> moss<00:03:40.430> by

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
that Oh No then I'm putting peat moss by

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:41.979 
that Oh No then I'm putting peat moss by
the<00:03:40.909> way<00:03:41.060> you'd<00:03:41.239> have<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.450> put<00:03:41.599> all<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.930> stuff

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
the way you'd have to put all this stuff

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.800 
the way you'd have to put all this stuff
there's<00:03:42.829> a<00:03:42.890> lot<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.189> stuff<00:03:43.400> I'm<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:44.540> telling

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
there's a lot of stuff I'm just telling

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.149 
there's a lot of stuff I'm just telling
people<00:03:45.079> they<00:03:45.409> don't<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.680> put<00:03:45.769> all<00:03:45.829> this

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
people they don't have to put all this

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.240 
people they don't have to put all this
stuff<00:03:47.409> keep<00:03:48.409> you<00:03:48.470> literally<00:03:48.739> growing<00:03:49.040> and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
stuff keep you literally growing and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.679 
stuff keep you literally growing and
probably<00:03:49.519> just<00:03:49.670> pure<00:03:49.790> compost<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.599> is

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
probably just pure compost but this is

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.390 
probably just pure compost but this is
going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> make<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.230> super<00:03:51.549> supercharged

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
going to make it a super supercharged

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.970 
going to make it a super supercharged
this<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.549> more<00:03:55.819> like<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.139> soil<00:03:57.139> base<00:03:57.500> or<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
this is more like a soil base or a

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.140 
this is more like a soil base or a
container<00:03:58.459> base<00:03:58.790> mix<00:03:59.750> soil<00:04:00.379> mix<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:02.000> we're

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
container base mix soil mix so we're

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.319 
container base mix soil mix so we're
texturizing<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.170> lot

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
texturizing it a lot

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.149 
texturizing it a lot
all<00:04:05.329> right<00:04:05.510> now<00:04:05.629> why<00:04:05.900> are<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.109> ordering<00:04:06.260> it

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.629 

water<00:04:10.159> is<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> key<00:04:10.670> essential<00:04:11.209> for<00:04:11.450> life<00:04:12.639> all

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
water is a key essential for life all

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.610 
water is a key essential for life all
right<00:04:13.790> we<00:04:13.970> want<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.420> go<00:04:14.540> there<00:04:14.750> yeah<00:04:14.959> does

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
right we want to go there yeah does

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.909 
right we want to go there yeah does
about<00:04:15.829> right<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.930> what's<00:04:18.349> next<00:04:18.500> put<00:04:18.829> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
about right and what's next put the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.490 
about right and what's next put the
potatoes<00:04:19.329> lift<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.109> mix<00:04:21.320> done

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
potatoes lift it in it is a mix done

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.469 
potatoes lift it in it is a mix done
usually<00:04:22.370> when<00:04:22.520> you're<00:04:22.639> starting<00:04:22.940> plants<00:04:23.389> you

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
usually when you're starting plants you

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.200 
usually when you're starting plants you
kind<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.750> want<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.020> start<00:04:24.320> them<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.530> moist<00:04:24.740> soil

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
kind of want to start them in moist soil

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.180 
kind of want to start them in moist soil
not<00:04:26.210> dry<00:04:26.570> stuff

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
not dry stuff

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.850 
not dry stuff
make<00:04:28.850> sense<00:04:31.750> okay<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.380> don't<00:04:33.530> want<00:04:33.770> to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
make sense okay you don't want to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.290 
make sense okay you don't want to
saturate<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.490> soil<00:04:34.640> too<00:04:34.880> much<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.180> want

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
saturate the soil too much you just want

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.320 
saturate the soil too much you just want
to<00:04:35.450> moisturize<00:04:36.760> any<00:04:37.930> tendency<00:04:38.930> that's<00:04:39.350> there

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
to moisturize any tendency that's there

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.970 
to moisturize any tendency that's there
saturate<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.450> becomes<00:04:41.690> anaerobic<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.800> want

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
saturate it becomes anaerobic you want

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.980 
saturate it becomes anaerobic you want
to<00:04:43.130> remain<00:04:43.400> Arabic<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.800> we<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.070> about<00:04:46.990> this

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
to remain Arabic so we have about this

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.450 
to remain Arabic so we have about this
many<00:04:48.260> potatoes<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.830> know<00:04:48.890> each<00:04:49.070> other

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
many potatoes you know each other

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.250 
many potatoes you know each other
only<00:04:50.030> we're<00:04:50.240> not<00:04:50.270> gonna<00:04:50.450> put<00:04:50.690> all<00:04:50.840> these<00:04:51.020> in

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
only we're not gonna put all these in

only we're not gonna put all these in
here<00:04:51.410> that's<00:04:51.770> what<00:04:51.950> half<00:04:52.130> how<00:04:52.520> many<00:04:52.760> potatoes

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
here that's what half how many potatoes

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.170 
here that's what half how many potatoes
do<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.420> need<00:04:53.570> for<00:04:53.690> something<00:04:54.110> this<00:04:54.200> size<00:04:55.180> not

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
do you need for something this size not

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.670 
do you need for something this size not
many<00:04:56.450> probably<00:04:57.260> like<00:04:57.530> what<00:04:58.100> five<00:04:59.590> depends<00:05:00.590> on

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
many probably like what five depends on

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.350 
many probably like what five depends on
the<00:05:00.770> size<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.190> your<00:05:01.280> seeds<00:05:01.610> -<00:05:01.820> yeah<00:05:04.120> you<00:05:05.120> don't

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
once we get more soil I'm thinking like

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.160 
once we get more soil I'm thinking like
two<00:06:00.890> feet<00:06:01.190> above<00:06:01.400> this<00:06:01.820> soil<00:06:02.120> we<00:06:02.870> start

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
two feet above this soil we start

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.890 
two feet above this soil we start
hilling<00:06:03.530> up<00:06:03.740> inch<00:06:04.040> by<00:06:04.370> inch

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
hilling up inch by inch

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.530 
hilling up inch by inch
to<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.320> top
