Lotus fans we've seen already this year

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.970 
Lotus fans we've seen already this year
through<00:00:12.389> various<00:00:13.110> events<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
through various events that we have a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.189 
through various events that we have a
lot<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> people<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:15.269> really<00:00:15.330> follow<00:00:15.750> loaders

lot of people are really follow loaders

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.160 
lot of people are really follow loaders
and<00:00:16.430> Lotus<00:00:17.430> means<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> lot<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.050> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
looking forward to Silverstone and I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
looking forward to Silverstone and I
think<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.689> gonna<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.869> exciting

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
think I think it's gonna be exciting

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.550 
think I think it's gonna be exciting
weekend<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> new<00:00:24.150> circuit<00:00:24.480> layout<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.170> it's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
weekend in a new circuit layout so it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.080 
weekend in a new circuit layout so it's
gonna<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> bit<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.430> challenge<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.849> Friday

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
gonna be a bit of a challenge on Friday

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.109 
gonna be a bit of a challenge on Friday
to<00:00:27.689> learn<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> circuit<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
to learn to circuit them and see how the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.420 
to learn to circuit them and see how the
how<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> setup<00:00:31.199> works<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.070> need<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> do

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
how the setup works out if we need to do

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.069 
how the setup works out if we need to do
something<00:00:32.940> different<00:00:33.090> comparing<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
something different comparing to the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
something different comparing to the
previous<00:00:34.469> years<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.910> think<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> should<00:00:36.090> be

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
previous years I think it should be

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.360 
previous years I think it should be
exciting<00:00:36.270> weekend<00:00:36.809> every<00:00:37.800> new<00:00:37.920> circuit<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
exciting weekend every new circuit that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
exciting weekend every new circuit that
I've<00:00:38.520> gone<00:00:38.700> after<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.540> few<00:00:39.840> laps<00:00:40.050> I've<00:00:40.379> always

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
I've gone after a few laps I've always

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549 
I've gone after a few laps I've always
been<00:00:41.370> able<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.760> drive<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.350> reasonably<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:43.530> in

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
been able to drive it reasonably well in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.040 
been able to drive it reasonably well in
and<00:00:43.890> i'm<00:00:44.789> sure<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.059> find<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> lines<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and i'm sure i find the lines and the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.479 
and i'm sure i find the lines and the
breaking<00:00:46.230> points<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.129> takes<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
breaking points and it just takes a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
breaking points and it just takes a
couple<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.760> runs<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
couple of runs you know to to do that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
couple of runs you know to to do that
i'll<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> circuit<00:00:52.199> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
i'll just have a look at the circuit on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
i'll just have a look at the circuit on
thursday<00:00:52.739> walk<00:00:53.039> around<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> talk<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> my

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
thursday walk around and talk to my

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
thursday walk around and talk to my
engineer<00:00:54.660> about<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.530> possible<00:00:55.710> lines<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
engineer about some possible lines and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
engineer about some possible lines and
about<00:00:57.170> various<00:00:58.170> things<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> circuits

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
about various things about the circuits

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
about various things about the circuits
of<00:00:59.219> curbs<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.149> some<00:01:00.390> bumps<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.680> know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of curbs maybe or some bumps or you know

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.439 
of curbs maybe or some bumps or you know
how<00:01:01.890> things<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.250> looking<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:03.300> on

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
how things are looking and then on

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.800 
how things are looking and then on
friday<00:01:03.949> just<00:01:04.949> go<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.369> feel<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
friday just go out and feel it and see

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.109 
friday just go out and feel it and see
what<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.229> my<00:01:07.979> brain<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> telling<00:01:08.549> me<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> do

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
what my my brain is telling me to do

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
what my my brain is telling me to do
it's<00:01:09.750> potentially<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> better<00:01:10.619> chance<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's potentially a better chance to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's potentially a better chance to
overtake<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> mean<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> past

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
overtake because I mean the past

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
overtake because I mean the past
silverstone<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> most

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
silverstone was one of the most

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.590 
silverstone was one of the most
difficult<00:01:14.369> place<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> whole<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.450> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
difficult place to whole thing it was so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
difficult place to whole thing it was so
high<00:01:15.810> speed<00:01:16.080> corners<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.590> he<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:16.890> not

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
high speed corners that he was just not

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.030 
high speed corners that he was just not
possible<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:18.420> possible<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.860> car

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
possible not possible don't take the car

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440 
possible not possible don't take the car
in<00:01:20.130> front<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.939> fact<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.299> not

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
in front of you what in fact was not

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
in front of you what in fact was not
possible<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.840> follow<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.979> car<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> front<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
possible to follow the car in front of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.410 
possible to follow the car in front of
you<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.790> sense<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> looks

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you so in that in that sense it looks

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170 
you so in that in that sense it looks
better<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.799> quick<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> whatever<00:01:29.790> car<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
better to go quick in whatever car you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.969 
better to go quick in whatever car you
you<00:01:30.869> drive<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> find<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> right

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you drive that you got to find the right

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
you drive that you got to find the right
lines<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> find<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> right

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
lines and you're going to find the right

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
lines and you're going to find the right
rhythm<00:01:33.840> through<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> high-speed<00:01:34.920> sections

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
rhythm through the high-speed sections

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.390 
rhythm through the high-speed sections
especially<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.750> first<00:01:37.130> really<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> first

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
especially the first really the first

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
especially the first really the first
seven<00:01:38.909> turns<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.200> very

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
seven turns you know they are very very

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
seven turns you know they are very very
fast<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> almost<00:01:41.610> no<00:01:42.090> breaking<00:01:42.540> oh<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
fast and the almost no breaking oh it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
fast and the almost no breaking oh it's
just<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> lifting<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> trying<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> find

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just a bit of lifting and trying to find

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.569 
just a bit of lifting and trying to find
the<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.610> line<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:45.979> apex<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the good line and the right apex and and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.149 
the good line and the right apex and and
it's<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.149> about<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:49.170> nailing<00:01:49.409> mainly<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's all about just nailing mainly the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.250 
it's all about just nailing mainly the
first<00:01:50.369> sector

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
first sector

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.350 
first sector
it's<00:01:52.800> difficult<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> any<00:01:53.730> kind<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.030> car<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's difficult in any kind of car and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.900 
it's difficult in any kind of car and
just<00:01:55.350> trying<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.650> find<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:55.980> balance<00:01:56.040> good

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
just trying to find a good balance good

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.330 
just trying to find a good balance good
confidence<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.690> pushing<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.680> high<00:01:58.800> speed<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
confidence to pushing the high speed and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.790 
confidence to pushing the high speed and
and<00:01:59.520> if<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.150> find<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.350> lap<00:02:01.590> time

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
and if you find that then the lap time

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.340 
and if you find that then the lap time
should<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:01.980> good<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:03.510> doesn't<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.050> make<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
should be good it doesn't really make a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.510 
should be good it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:05.180> with<00:02:06.180> us<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.890> dry<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.369> wet

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
difference with us you know dry or wet

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.670 
difference with us you know dry or wet
in<00:02:08.820> terms<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.210> it<00:02:09.420> being<00:02:09.450> more<00:02:09.840> difficult<00:02:10.290> more

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
in terms of it being more difficult more

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.360 
in terms of it being more difficult more
easy<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.490> think<00:02:12.560> both<00:02:13.560> conditions<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:14.160> very

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
easy I think both conditions is very

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.070 
easy I think both conditions is very
challenging<00:02:14.550> circuit<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.570> very<00:02:15.900> high

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
challenging circuit it's a very high

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.790 
challenging circuit it's a very high
speed<00:02:17.270> especially<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.750> first<00:02:19.260> sector<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
speed especially the first sector and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
speed especially the first sector and
the<00:02:19.830> old<00:02:20.190> part<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:21.180> very<00:02:21.270> high<00:02:21.480> speed

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the old part is very very high speed

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.110 
the old part is very very high speed
section<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.890> need<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.760> right

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
section so you need to get that right

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.560 
section so you need to get that right
and<00:02:24.740> in<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.890> rain<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.280> course<00:02:26.460> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> fall

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
and in the rain of course if you fall

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.300 
and in the rain of course if you fall
off<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.020> just<00:02:28.320> fall<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.500> from<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.160> higher

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
off you just fall off from a higher

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.450 
off you just fall off from a higher
speed<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.510> its<00:02:31.380> potential<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> bigger

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
speed so its potential for a bigger

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.480 
speed so its potential for a bigger
chance<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.440> maybe<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.950> sense<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.430> know

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
chance so maybe in that sense you know

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.610 
chance so maybe in that sense you know
you<00:02:35.700> can't<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.840> take<00:02:37.050> care<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.500> bit

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
you can't really take care a little bit

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.550 
you can't really take care a little bit
in<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> high<00:02:38.010> speed<00:02:38.280> corners<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> web<00:02:38.970> but

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
in the high speed corners in the web but

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
in the high speed corners in the web but
but<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.740> always<00:02:40.950> difficult<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:42.000> it's

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
but it's always difficult and it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.990 
but it's always difficult and it's
always<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.450> big<00:02:42.660> challenge<00:02:43.010> silverstone<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.190> do

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
always a big challenge silverstone to do

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.720 
always a big challenge silverstone to do
a<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.300> laptop<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.010> still<00:02:47.010> suspect<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.610> going

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
a good laptop I still suspect it's going

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.960 
a good laptop I still suspect it's going
to<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.910> quite<00:02:48.060> difficult<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.820> qualifying<00:02:50.820> is

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to be quite difficult and qualifying is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.320 
to be quite difficult and qualifying is
going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.240> be<00:02:51.360> crucial<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.050> sure
