00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.139

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.839
 I'm going to bring more people to you today. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 video of today I will bring here is what 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.590
 improved android 4.4 point 3 is in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.269
 here motorola motorola update 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 to prove you have this version 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.250
 on the phone if you want to watch the video 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 update that will have the description 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 so the video catalyzes he talks a little 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.380
 for the grade of 4.4 1.3 then they want 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 know so the modifications were not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 screams but things came there to search 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 eff sa 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.170
 the smartphone there will be optimization and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 fix the bugs in the camera I already mentioned 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 previous videos here on the channel 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 does not have a good a good quality 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 Okay, so it gives me an arrow to improve a camera. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.850
 improve the quality of it is to correct 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.340
 bugs because you kill her you 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.519
 pulling a hawk here and really 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 it takes a lot of image quality 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.780
 holy and should have made the correction 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 Sounds good, we're going to adjust 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 bluetooth and wifi or, to be sure 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.070
 improve connectivity, that is to say, 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.080
 speed that will come from your 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.119
 computer on your modem and the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.049
 bluetooth is improving wifi and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 to improve the bluetooth of motorola moto g 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.700
 Another thing was the correction in the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 missed calls 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.460
 It's either when you 're paying 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.430
 You have not seen one night, for example. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 the missed call on the target you 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 did not understand the call led wanted 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.229
 I was giving some trouble now he 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.049
 it's calibrated let's say so it is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.420
 good and camera focus in correction mode 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.530
 regular and hdr such camera focus 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 improved and hdr is also better 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.259
 made some repair of eugen connection of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.960
 data with action to restart the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.570
 random organization you motogp 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.509
 I randomly rebooted, nothing good. 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.180
 He certainly corrected that. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 data connection would connect you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
 wifi do not connect 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.600
 the right to the pension to connect the operator 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
 so small super several kilos 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.410
 small problems that presented the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.959
 g were solved with this 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.760
 small delegation of 161 mega that was 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.140
 at least the event on this engine rotates 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.640
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.260
