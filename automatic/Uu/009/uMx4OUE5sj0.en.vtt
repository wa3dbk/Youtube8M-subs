would<00:03:17.950> be<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.190> sensible<00:03:18.549> play<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.819> make<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.410> just

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
would be a sensible play to make I just

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.020 
would be a sensible play to make I just
go<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.560> super<00:03:20.950> power<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.730> would<00:03:21.849> die

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
go for super power because it would die

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.270 
go for super power because it would die
from<00:03:22.239> there<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.930> thought<00:03:23.139> wow<00:03:23.829> one

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
from there and I thought wow one

from there and I thought wow one
superpower<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.970> then<00:03:25.120> switch<00:03:25.359> out<00:03:25.599> why<00:03:25.840> not

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
superpower and then switch out why not

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.410 
superpower and then switch out why not

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
good for the trick on this thing not the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.270 
good for the trick on this thing not the
best<00:04:17.630> thing<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.900> could<00:04:18.079> have<00:04:18.109> tricked<00:04:18.470> but<00:04:18.769> you

that's<00:04:21.829> unfortunate<00:04:22.490> but<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:23.000> do<00:04:23.270> still<00:04:23.630> have

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
that's unfortunate but I do still have

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.680 
that's unfortunate but I do still have
my<00:04:24.080> bastard<00:04:24.830> on<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:26.330> would<00:04:26.480> have<00:04:26.570> actually

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
my bastard on this would have actually

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
my bastard on this would have actually
been<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.960> reasonable<00:04:27.650> opportunity<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:28.430> go<00:04:28.610> to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
been a reasonable opportunity to go to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.500 
been a reasonable opportunity to go to
malamar<00:04:30.710> although<00:04:31.100> no<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:31.940> guess<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.300> helps

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
malamar although no I guess it helps

I<00:06:06.610> don't<00:06:07.479> actually<00:06:07.690> have<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:07.840> water<00:06:08.080> move<00:06:08.349> on

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
I don't actually have a water move on

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.260 
I don't actually have a water move on
this<00:06:08.560> thing<00:06:08.800> I<00:06:08.919> just<00:06:08.949> have<00:06:09.310> Aura<00:06:09.580> Sphere<00:06:09.669> plus

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270

this thing I just have Aura Sphere plus
dark<00:06:10.660> balls<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:11.289> figured<00:06:12.250> like<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:13.210> ability

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
dark balls I figured like this ability

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.600 
dark balls I figured like this ability
brings<00:06:14.440> those<00:06:14.650> both<00:06:14.979> up<00:06:15.220> by<00:06:15.520> fifty<00:06:15.849> percent<00:06:16.349> so

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
brings those both up by fifty percent so

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.920 
brings those both up by fifty percent so
you<00:06:18.610> know<00:06:18.699> there's<00:06:18.940> no<00:06:19.060> water<00:06:19.360> move<00:06:19.629> like

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
you know there's no water move like

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.820 
you know there's no water move like
outside<00:06:20.409> of<00:06:20.560> I'm<00:06:20.919> no<00:06:22.110> surf<00:06:23.110> i<00:06:23.319> think<00:06:23.500> is<00:06:23.590> a<00:06:23.620> bit

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
outside of I'm no surf i think is a bit

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.350 
outside of I'm no surf i think is a bit
more<00:06:23.949> powerful<00:06:24.430> when<00:06:24.550> you<00:06:24.610> factor<00:06:24.819> in<00:06:25.030> start

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
more powerful when you factor in start

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.050 
more powerful when you factor in start
but<00:06:25.629> i<00:06:26.220> think<00:06:27.220> of<00:06:27.310> those<00:06:27.400> two<00:06:27.460> moves<00:06:27.849> get

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
but i think of those two moves get

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.830 
but i think of those two moves get
pretty<00:06:28.240> good<00:06:28.300> coverage<00:06:28.780> so<00:06:29.080> yeah<00:06:29.710> why<00:06:29.949> not

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
pretty good coverage so yeah why not

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.270 
pretty good coverage so yeah why not
this<00:06:31.840> one<00:06:32.020> comes<00:06:32.169> in<00:06:32.409> because<00:06:32.620> our<00:06:33.069> can<00:06:33.190> eyes

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
this one comes in because our can eyes

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.860 
this one comes in because our can eyes
naturally<00:06:33.580> really<00:06:34.150> quick<00:06:34.389> it's<00:06:34.569> going<00:06:34.720> to<00:06:34.780> let

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
naturally really quick it's going to let

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.399 
naturally really quick it's going to let
speed<00:06:35.169> me<00:06:35.610> go<00:06:36.610> into<00:06:36.819> malamar<00:06:37.539> which<00:06:38.199> i<00:06:38.349> will

superpower and hope I can live a hit

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.320 
superpower and hope I can live a hit
that<00:06:45.130> way<00:06:45.340> I<00:06:45.370> can<00:06:45.550> hopefully<00:06:45.819> take<00:06:46.030> him<00:06:46.240> up

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
that way I can hopefully take him up

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.740 
that way I can hopefully take him up
next<00:06:46.659> turn<00:06:46.840> if<00:06:47.110> he<00:06:47.500> is<00:06:47.770> indeed<00:06:48.039> banded<00:06:48.819> he

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
next turn if he is indeed banded he

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.110 
next turn if he is indeed banded he
can't<00:06:49.960> ease<00:06:50.139> be<00:06:50.349> the<00:06:50.500> next<00:06:50.740> turn<00:06:50.889> so<00:06:51.220> that's

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
can't ease be the next turn so that's

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.110 
can't ease be the next turn so that's
always<00:06:52.300> great<00:06:53.250> superpower<00:06:54.250> decent<00:06:54.909> amount<00:06:55.060> of

damage<00:06:55.419> the<00:06:55.750> defense<00:06:56.080> rise<00:06:56.349> is<00:06:56.620> crucial<00:06:57.190> to

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
damage the defense rise is crucial to
