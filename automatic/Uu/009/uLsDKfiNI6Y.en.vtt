everything connects in the air not
everything<00:01:28.619> connects<00:01:28.920> obviously<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.450> it's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
everything connects obviously so it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
everything connects obviously so it's
gonna<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.500> difficult<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850

if they patched in the in the feedback

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.890 
if they patched in the in the feedback
because<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.209> comments<00:02:55.599> section<00:02:55.810> cuz
