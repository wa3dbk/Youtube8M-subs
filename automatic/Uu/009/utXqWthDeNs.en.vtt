00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 super paper mario for nintendo wii los 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.770
 fans and critics have very opinions 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.719
 divided from this game since many 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.730
 it seems a not so good egg 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.460
 compared to the versions of ying jeou 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.320
 imitating your level 4 because there are also 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.689
 many who liked this game 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.269
 so I'll take the side of those who 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.320
 they like it because honestly this game 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.419
 I loved 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.509
 Of course I played the half version 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.700
 64 but the one from jane which is 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.950
 considered the best of all and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.950
 I honestly do not feel that this game 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.070
 has been inferior or even superior to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.620
 the other but what is not is that the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 leave you maybe a little harder and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.240
 long however I do not think that what 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.240
 make better or even worse game 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.879
 Something already common in Mario's games 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.519
 This has 8 worlds or in this case 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.469
 it is told in chapters in this game in 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.890
 which the main mission is 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.280
 find a place or pure heart and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.110
 about the graphics I loved they have 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.939
 a very good artistic touch 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.200
 especially if we see them from the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.200
 perspective in 2d 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.740
 my favorite chapter world are four already 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.409
 that much of this is spent in the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.960
 very space 7 style the ships 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.390
 someone very out of the traditional of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.370
 a game of mario but very funny 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.480
 as well 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.230
 as you like 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 how 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 all right 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 as expected in a game of 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.409
 mario this one has power too and my 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.840
 favorite is the star in this game since 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.320
 that we became a giant mario 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.290
 pixelated the tendons making min 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.229
 in a shredder destroying 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.120
 all and also something very different from what 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.910
 traditional since the star 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.700
 normally it gives us only one power 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.209
 invincible in the other games but not 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.209
 in this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 probably one of the most novelties 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.190
 great of this game is that they can 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 play in 2d as in 3d giving us 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650
 a wider world explore in which 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 we can find things that from the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.550
 perspective in 2d it would be impossible to see anymore 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.920
 be secret pipe roads or even 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.050
 enemies or any object that we 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.050
 serve to be able to pass the world 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 however this is a skill that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.600
 can only be achieved with mario and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.970
 that Mario will not be the only character 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.370
 let's use in this game as we go 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.650
 advancing the worlds in the banks 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.020
 coming different characters in 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.800
 our team which I show you 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.800
 an instant 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.630
 the first character that will join us 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.910
 team will be the princess peach who with 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.490
 your bounce float will help us look 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.490
 places that like mario we could never 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.030
 curiously then he joins us is going to be 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.270
 who at first refuses but 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.210
 princess peach ends up convincing him and 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.940
 finally we have luigi who is 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.940
 controlled at the beginning of the game by the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.340
 enemy of this game but we finished 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.860
 rescuing him and him with his great 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.860
 jumps the 7 of 9 by the end of the game 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.810
 and also in each world we will be joined by a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.090
 pixel which are creatures with 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.910
 skills or powers that will also be 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.580
 crucial throughout the game in total 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.040
 let's write 8 which may be 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.760
 used by the characters that I mentioned 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.260
 previously that is pitch monsters luigi 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.260
 and of course mario 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.470
 definitely a very title 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.140
 recommended especially for those who 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 they have followed the series from the 64 internal 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.880
 or even for those who are first time 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.700
 who play a mario paper will look like 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.160
 very funny clear they have to take on 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.350
 note that this is a rpg and it is not the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.080
 typical super mario that we have played in 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.140
 The other consoles this game requires 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.040
 exploration requires learning to decipher 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:56.900
 and do things that in common games 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.900
 of supermario we do not normally 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.790
 good and finally what I have left 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.060
 tell them is that if you have 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.870
 thought of playing this game prepare for 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.930
 about 20 or even 25 hours from him since 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.390
 it takes a lot of time and I almost metal 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.730
 25 hours but if you are the 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.590
 people who like to use guides or 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.440
 videos to be able to pass a game 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.800
 it probably takes less than 20 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.750
 maybe up to 15 but if they are of those like 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.120
 I like to break your head 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.750
 until you can decipher something to be able 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.750
 pass certain areas or a level 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.500
 It's probably about 20 or 25 hours 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.360
 depending on how patients are 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.390
 I honestly had to look for nothing more 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.640
 for two areas help the internet 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.090
 since to this day I do not understand 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.980
 what I had to do to be able to pass 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:04.040
 but I managed to get through maybe 90% without 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.380
 help from guides or anything and well that was 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.220
 everything I hope you liked and see you 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.220
 in the next
