this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.079> part<00:00:01.319> 5<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.560> my<00:00:01.890> reshoot<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.580> my

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this is part 5 of my reshoot of my

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is part 5 of my reshoot of my
Jordan<00:00:03.030> retros<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:04.040> I<00:00:05.330> think<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.629> did<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.109> most

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
Jordan retros and I think I did the most

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.220 
Jordan retros and I think I did the most
work<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.950> these<00:00:08.570> you'll<00:00:09.570> probably<00:00:09.780> be<00:00:10.019> able<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
work on these you'll probably be able to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.660 
work on these you'll probably be able to
tell<00:00:14.690> these<00:00:15.690> are<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.400> Jordan<00:00:17.400> 6<00:00:17.900> infrareds

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
tell these are the Jordan 6 infrareds

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.859 
tell these are the Jordan 6 infrareds
take<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.820> both<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.180> these<00:00:21.300> ones

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
take out both of these ones

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:32.269 
take out both of these ones
there's<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> retro<00:00:22.619> card<00:00:30.769> again<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> noticed

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
there's the retro card again you noticed

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.560 
there's the retro card again you noticed
in<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.180> watched<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.600> previous<00:00:33.630> videos<00:00:34.380> you

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
in if you watched my previous videos you

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
in if you watched my previous videos you
will<00:00:36.570> notice<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.350> didn't<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.250> shoes

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
will notice that I didn't have my shoes

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.440 
will notice that I didn't have my shoes
in<00:00:38.730> plastic<00:00:39.149> bags<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.180> mainly

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in plastic bags and that was mainly

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.459 
in plastic bags and that was mainly
because<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.649> didn't<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.489> any<00:00:44.670> better<00:00:44.750> I<00:00:45.750> just

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
because I didn't know any better I just

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
because I didn't know any better I just
kept<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:46.860> shoes<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.360> box

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
kept my shoes in the box

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.029 
kept my shoes in the box
which<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> thought<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:49.440> keep<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.800> nice<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
which I thought would keep them nice and
perfect<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.780> wrong

the tissue paper and everything it will

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
the tissue paper and everything it will
advance<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.280> yellowing<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> bottoms
