00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.730
 today I have 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.359
 the hp stream 7 the cheapest 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.820
 windows 8 tablet mode 81 tablet but 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.930
 maybe one and already we recognize 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.250
 not only have eight villages here 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.369
 but we just thought 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.660
 become the current picture 9926 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.419
 from windows 10 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.559
 Say the technical preview and there will 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.329
 Do not just show something yourself 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.390
 cheap tablet or how good to 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.899
 cheap tablet also on windows 10 with 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.550
 Windows 10 works the manual 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.650
 we copy the whole thing ourselves 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.850
 we can do the whole thing ourselves 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.820
 Find her blog and also a video 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.470
 description and the link to it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 and yes in terms of the performance 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.380
 It really is not a big difference 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.910
 windows 8 1 here will be easy times 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.860
 already several programs open 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 speak internet explorers open 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.460
 various orders I have open store, etc 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.350
 and also several desktops achieve that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.310
 case 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.380
 and as you can see here 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.090
 wonderful also between the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.060
 individual things switch back and forth 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.329
 or that is taking too long now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.799
 So you can really go here now 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.819
 easily get everything in and catch and 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.459
 Of course, the whole thing with the 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.950
 make a gesture from the side and here too 

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:26.170
 then, for example, make screenshots 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.350
 and so on, so that works 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.569
 so far everything is wonderful here now 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.240
 tablets view that talks to the 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.249
 full screen start menu could be quite 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.749
 of course also change on the windows 10 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.369
 view that on the desktop view 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.490
 because of that , he liked it or 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.289
 better like can change all over 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.999
 and yes as I said so the performance 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.159
 is really very very good so hitler 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:51.510
 and super fluid we have no big ones 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.220
 Delays outside unity the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.690
 yes, I'll go through windows 10 through 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.010
 the previews status just yet 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.480
 to be triggered 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.180
 so i decided now all apps 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.620
 calls now it was very clear 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 faster so the first call to 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.210
 Example if the device is either or 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770
 if there is a longer time selection then comes 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 your first call of all apps 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.820
 a short delay of two three 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.580
 seconds until he has loaded all but in 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.770
 principle, everything is wonderful 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 to open 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.830
 also wonder ots example well offset 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.330
 not logged in but how to 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.330
 everything happens very fast 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.390
 sometimes the touchscreen reacts there 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.070
 not so optimally good something else 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 changes so then of course what 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.490
 Of course much will be interesting too 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.440
 youtube in 1080p one works 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.580
 full hd display in here but the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.130
 Of course, videos are easy to handle 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.690
 Play like this one here now in the case 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.150
 she is also running smoothly 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.570
 liquid one can also go back and forth here 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.880
 So, none of this is jumping at all 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.430
 problem that then synonymous times a video 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.239
 can print with so even has just 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.239
 high-resolution videos 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.269
 yes it was really much more I can 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.410
 barely show it around 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.860
 performance to show the way we do 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 Just small jerks here are apps 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 has to reload or something similar 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.980
 Just remember the gate later in one 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.380
 beta version of the operating system can there 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.790
 from time to time but jerking 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.860
 Overall, I have to say that it already 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.800
 very fluid and also a large part 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.239
 all functions works that way 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.239
 You can easily do the whole thing here 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.110
 can use all between so too 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980
 here for example already the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.350
 Notification spanel in which one also 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.280
 practicing in the setting comes, etc. so 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.390
 all this very well done 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.850
 just how the touchscreen is 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.709
 hakelig is now just in the case 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.280
 the drivers because we have windows 8 3 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.489
 just installed but that's just it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.590
 in a preview version good so much 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.269
 first to windows 10 on the hp 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 extreme 7 tablet and then until the 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.630
 next time
