for<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.700> around<00:00:38.969> rather<00:00:39.300> than

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
for the right way around rather than

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.360 
for the right way around rather than
just<00:00:39.629> having<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.020> turn<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.350> backwards<00:00:40.559> got<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
just having to turn it backwards got a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
just having to turn it backwards got a
nice<00:00:41.489> big<00:00:41.790> gap<00:00:42.030> waiting<00:00:42.450> wedgie<00:00:42.750> foot<00:00:42.989> in

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
nice big gap waiting wedgie foot in

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.660 
nice big gap waiting wedgie foot in
there<00:00:44.570> technical<00:00:45.570> specs<00:00:45.960> wise<00:00:46.489> look<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
there technical specs wise look at the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
there technical specs wise look at the
grips<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.860> crisps<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
grips they are kind of just crisps and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
grips they are kind of just crisps and
the<00:00:50.640> grips<00:00:51.050> not<00:00:52.050> softest<00:00:52.500> grips<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> world

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the grips not softest grips in the world

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.029 
the grips not softest grips in the world
but<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.550> last<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.000> while<00:00:54.120> obviously

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
but they will last a while obviously

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
but they will last a while obviously
getting<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.219> new<00:00:57.149> t-bar<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> crisp<00:00:58.320> as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
getting a new t-bar for the crisp as

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.189 
getting a new t-bar for the crisp as
well<00:00:59.059> as<00:01:00.059> well<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> obviously<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> clan

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
well as well as that obviously the clan

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
well as well as that obviously the clan
for<00:01:01.440> main<00:01:01.620> features<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> new<00:01:02.309> clamp<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
for main features of the new clamp is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.960 
for main features of the new clamp is
the<00:01:03.480> fact<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.430> six<00:01:05.430> mil<00:01:05.640> bolts

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the fact that it does have six mil bolts

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
the fact that it does have six mil bolts
in<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:07.140> obviously<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> mean

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
in it which obviously is going to mean

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.530 
in it which obviously is going to mean
they're<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.610> stronger<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.420> means

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
they're going to be stronger so it means

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
they're going to be stronger so it means
the<00:01:09.659> last<00:01:09.900> longer<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.409> obviously<00:01:10.710> won't

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the last longer and obviously won't

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.070 
the last longer and obviously won't
Randolph<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> easy<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.930> they

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
Randolph is easy as well as that they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.690 
Randolph is easy as well as that they
are<00:01:13.229> five<00:01:13.409> tenths<00:01:13.710> ones<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.100> having<00:01:14.340> dips<00:01:14.580> on

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
are five tenths ones so having dips on

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
are five tenths ones so having dips on
the<00:01:14.790> end<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.720> they're<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:16.020> just

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the end as well so they're not just

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
the end as well so they're not just
threaded<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> clamp<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.670> kind

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
threaded into the clamp there's no kind

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.620 
threaded into the clamp there's no kind
of<00:01:18.330> risk<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.729> shredding<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> insid<00:01:21.180> clamp

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
of risk of you shredding the insid clamp

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
of risk of you shredding the insid clamp
then<00:01:22.200> dinner<00:01:22.560> where<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.189> tightly<00:01:23.610> clamp

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
then dinner where you can tightly clamp

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.359 
then dinner where you can tightly clamp
obviously<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:24.990> feature<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:26.250> got

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
obviously that's a good feature it's got

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
obviously that's a good feature it's got
the<00:01:26.460> new<00:01:26.640> alloy<00:01:27.060> fork<00:01:27.509> obviously<00:01:28.140> running<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the new alloy fork obviously running the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
the new alloy fork obviously running the
HIC<00:01:28.979> compression<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.079> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
HIC compression so that's going to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960 
HIC compression so that's going to
compress<00:01:31.439> bearings<00:01:31.920> nice<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.400> tight<00:01:32.610> lot<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
compress bearings nice and tight lot of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
compress bearings nice and tight lot of
companies<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.479> seem<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
companies do seem to be getting down a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.480 
companies do seem to be getting down a
HIC<00:01:35.009> route<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> moment<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:37.680> CS<00:01:38.009> seems<00:01:38.280> to

as not as much and it's not going to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
as not as much and it's not going to
mean<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.830> they're<00:02:15.160> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.430> dead<00:02:15.700> flat
