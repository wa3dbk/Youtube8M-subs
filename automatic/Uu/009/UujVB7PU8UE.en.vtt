Ponte Phoenix um now the way we're gonna
do<00:00:23.450> this<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:24.279> 100%<00:00:25.279> guaranteed<00:00:25.640> spawn<00:00:27.400> there

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
do this is 100% guaranteed spawn there

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.189 
do this is 100% guaranteed spawn there
are<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.150> locations<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:30.020> should

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
are the locations that you should

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.960 
are the locations that you should
probably<00:00:30.320> look<00:00:30.890> if<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.490> just<00:00:31.520> want<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.880> go

since update 1.04 or whatever that came
out<00:00:42.890> here<00:00:43.159> lately<00:00:43.430> um<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:46.220> spawn<00:00:46.610> rate<00:00:46.790> is

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
out here lately um the spawn rate is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.310 
out here lately um the spawn rate is
actually<00:00:47.330> quite<00:00:47.540> a<00:00:47.570> bit<00:00:47.659> higher<00:00:47.960> than<00:00:47.989> I've

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
actually quite a bit higher than I've

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.840 
actually quite a bit higher than I've
seen<00:00:48.350> them<00:00:48.680> in<00:00:48.799> spots<00:00:49.159> that<00:00:49.339> I<00:00:49.430> haven't<00:00:49.610> before

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
then BAM every single time a Phoenix

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.770 
then BAM every single time a Phoenix
will<00:03:25.590> spawn<00:03:25.769> right<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.370> driveway

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
will spawn right here in this driveway

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.800
