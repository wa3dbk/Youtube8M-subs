00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.600 

now<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.359> 2014<00:00:01.230> version<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.979> MacBook<00:00:02.220> Air

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
now the 2014 version of the MacBook Air

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.059 
now the 2014 version of the MacBook Air
is<00:00:02.760> pretty<00:00:03.360> much<00:00:03.570> identical<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.470> last<00:00:04.500> year's

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
is pretty much identical to last year's

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.460 
is pretty much identical to last year's
version<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.299> MacBook<00:00:06.569> Air<00:00:06.930> but<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.350> this

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
version of the MacBook Air but in this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.810 
version of the MacBook Air but in this
video<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:07.859> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> specifically<00:00:08.550> take<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
video we're going to specifically take a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
video we're going to specifically take a
look<00:00:09.059> at<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.330> new<00:00:09.570> model<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.260> air<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
look at this new model of the air and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.709 
look at this new model of the air and
see<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.130> compares<00:00:11.519> against<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.210> late

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
see how it compares against the late

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.919 
see how it compares against the late
2013<00:00:13.590> version<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.700> MacBook<00:00:15.000> Pro<00:00:15.450> Retina

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
2013 version of the MacBook Pro Retina

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
2013 version of the MacBook Pro Retina
Edition<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.710> without<00:00:16.920> any<00:00:17.039> further<00:00:17.130> ado<00:00:17.400> let's

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
Edition so without any further ado let's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.849 
Edition so without any further ado let's
get<00:00:17.910> right<00:00:18.119> into<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.600> comparison<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> see

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
get right into this comparison and see

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500 
get right into this comparison and see
how<00:00:20.039> these<00:00:20.189> two<00:00:20.250> models<00:00:20.609> fare<00:00:21.029> against<00:00:21.390> each

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
how these two models fare against each

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.580 
how these two models fare against each
other<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:23.420> we<00:00:24.420> always<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> MacBook

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
other now we always think of the MacBook

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
other now we always think of the MacBook
Air<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> smaller<00:00:26.580> counterpart<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Air as the smaller counterpart of the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.570 
Air as the smaller counterpart of the
MacBook<00:00:28.199> Pro<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> terms<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.189> footprint

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
MacBook Pro but in terms of footprint

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.640 
MacBook Pro but in terms of footprint
it's<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> slightly<00:00:30.599> larger<00:00:31.170> than<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it's actually a slightly larger than the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
it's actually a slightly larger than the
MacBook<00:00:32.189> Pro<00:00:32.399> Retina<00:00:32.820> Edition<00:00:33.210> however<00:00:33.570> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
MacBook Pro Retina Edition however in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
MacBook Pro Retina Edition however in
terms<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> thickness<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> weight<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.160> air

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
terms of thickness and weight the air

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
terms of thickness and weight the air
still<00:00:35.610> represents<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.510> compact

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
still represents a more compact

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.010 
still represents a more compact

year's<00:00:45.840> model<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> air<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:47.160> still<00:00:47.430> don't

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
year's model of the air we still don't

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
year's model of the air we still don't
see<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> Thunderbolt<00:00:48.539> 2<00:00:48.809> port<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.559> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
see a Thunderbolt 2 port we still have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.060 
see a Thunderbolt 2 port we still have
one<00:00:50.430> single<00:00:50.969> Thunderbolt<00:00:51.480> 1<00:00:51.719> port<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.260> the

one single Thunderbolt 1 port and the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
one single Thunderbolt 1 port and the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.770 
MacBook Retina Edition has two
Thunderbolt<00:00:55.980> 2.0<00:00:56.579> ports<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
Thunderbolt 2.0 ports so if you want the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
Thunderbolt 2.0 ports so if you want the
highest<00:00:57.989> bandwidth<00:00:58.739> connection<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.640> MacBook

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
Pro still has that advantage now

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439

certainly<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> big<00:01:02.730> selling<00:01:02.969> points

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
certainly one of the big selling points

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
certainly one of the big selling points
of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.840> MacBook<00:01:04.229> Pro<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> Retina

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of the MacBook Pro is that Retina

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000 
of the MacBook Pro is that Retina

going to test out the CPU by using

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.880 
going to test out the CPU by using

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the speeds between the two we're going

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.759 
the speeds between the two we're going
to<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:45.030> good<00:02:45.599> old-fashioned<00:02:46.230> Blackmagic

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769

to use good old-fashioned Blackmagic
speed<00:02:47.010> tests<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.489> here<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.329> we're

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
speed tests and here you can see we're

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.380 
speed tests and here you can see we're
getting<00:02:48.690> both<00:02:49.200> over<00:02:50.069> 700<00:02:50.819> megabytes<00:02:51.150> per

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
right so very similar performance and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.099 
right so very similar performance and
