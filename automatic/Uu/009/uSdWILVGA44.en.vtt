bit rate of 75,000 kilo bit per second
we<00:00:38.370> start<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> first<00:00:39.239> sample<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.140> bit

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
we start with the first sample and a bit

we start with the first sample and a bit
rate<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.730> 0.5<00:00:41.870> while<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.079> watch<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.290> delicious

Smarties<00:00:44.370> let's<00:00:44.820> talk<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> bit<00:00:45.300> about<00:00:45.570> bit

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
Smarties let's talk a bit about bit

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
Smarties let's talk a bit about bit
rates<00:00:46.430> why<00:00:47.430> would<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.420> low

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
rates why would you want to use a low

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
rates why would you want to use a low
bit<00:00:48.840> rate<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.219> video<00:00:50.370> files<00:00:50.820> will

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bit rate because your video files will

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
bit rate because your video files will
be<00:00:51.149> smaller<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.350> data<00:00:52.620> fits<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.430> SD

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
be smaller so more data fits on your SD

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.660 
be smaller so more data fits on your SD
card<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.180> later<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.079> laptop<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:56.219> if

you<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.030> cheap<00:00:57.390> SD<00:00:57.780> card<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> video

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you use a cheap SD card the video

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
you use a cheap SD card the video
recording<00:00:59.219> might<00:00:59.370> stop<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.570> SD

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
recording might stop because your SD

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
recording might stop because your SD
card<00:01:01.199> can't<00:01:01.559> keep<00:01:01.800> track<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> amount<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
information that gets written on it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070

a<00:01:05.010> lower<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.939> rate<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.450> help<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
a lower bit rate will help you to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.859 
a lower bit rate will help you to
prevent<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.909> editing<00:01:09.360> might<00:01:09.659> work

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
prevent this all the editing might work

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.719 
prevent this all the editing might work
better<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.770> computer<00:01:11.340> doesn't<00:01:11.580> have

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
better because a computer doesn't have

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
better because a computer doesn't have
to<00:01:12.000> handle<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.510> much<00:01:12.659> data<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to handle so much data at one time the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
to handle so much data at one time the
only<00:01:15.240> reason<00:01:15.750> why<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> would<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
only reason why you would want to do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
only reason why you would want to do
that<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.030> higher<00:01:18.299> bitrate

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that is because a higher bitrate

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
that is because a higher bitrate
contains<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.710> information<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> more

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
contains more information and more

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
contains more information and more
information<00:01:21.509> should<00:01:22.229> lead<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> better

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
information should lead to a better

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.539 
information should lead to a better
image<00:01:23.220> quality<00:01:23.600> does<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:25.100> did<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.310> see

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
image quality does it really did you see

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.749 
image quality does it really did you see
a<00:01:26.580> difference<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.330> far<00:01:28.369> let's<00:01:29.369> try<00:01:29.610> out

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
a difference so far let's try out

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.270 
a difference so far let's try out
another<00:01:30.000> setting<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.200> time<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.680> created<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
another setting this time I created a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
another setting this time I created a
little<00:01:32.430> Microsoft<00:01:33.180> advertisement<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.350> first

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
little Microsoft advertisement I first

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.370 
little Microsoft advertisement I first
saw<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.369> recorded<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> 0.5

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.690 

and<00:01:44.469> now<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.520> 1.5<00:01:46.210> as<00:01:46.960> before<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.770> can't<00:01:48.219> see<00:01:48.490> a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
and now is 1.5 as before I can't see a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.940 
and now is 1.5 as before I can't see a
clear<00:01:48.939> difference<00:01:49.180> but<00:01:50.079> I<00:01:50.140> wanted<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.590> test

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
clear difference but I wanted to test

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.399 
clear difference but I wanted to test
how<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.369> footage<00:01:51.820> behaves<00:01:52.240> when<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.689> do<00:01:52.810> strong

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
how the footage behaves when I do strong

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.279 
how the footage behaves when I do strong
color<00:01:53.770> grading<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.299> here's<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.750> same<00:01:55.990> video

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
color grading so here's the same video

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:29.080 
color grading so here's the same video
color<00:01:56.920> graded

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.809 

I<00:02:29.120> was<00:02:29.810> very<00:02:30.020> surprised<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.800> even<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.610> I

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
I was very surprised that even then I

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.690 
I was very surprised that even then I
couldn't<00:02:32.330> see<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> difference<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:34.010> me<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.400> lower

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
couldn't see a difference to me a lower

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.000 
couldn't see a difference to me a lower
bitrate<00:02:35.060> has<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.840> least<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.620> use<00:02:36.860> it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
bitrate has at least for what I use it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.110

case you have a camera that can adjust a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
case you have a camera that can adjust a
bit<00:02:48.709> rate<00:02:49.099> without<00:02:49.489> changing<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> resolution

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
bit rate without changing the resolution
