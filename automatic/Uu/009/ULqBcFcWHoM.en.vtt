00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.890
 When the day of Pentecost arrived 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.469
 They were all united together 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.049
 and suddenly a thunder came from the sky 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.150
 like a strong wind that blew the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 which filled the whole house where they were 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.430
 seated and tongues appeared 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.430
 spread out like fire when sitting 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 about each of them and they were all 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 filled with the holy spirit and began to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 speak in other languages â€‹â€‹according to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 spirit gave them that they spoke they lived 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.239
 then in jerusalem male Jews 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 sky and made this rumble was joined the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 crowd and they were confused because every 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.579
 you heard them speak in their own language and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.789
 they were astonished and amazed saying 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.340
 Look, these are not all Galileans 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.230
 they speak as we heard them 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.730
 speak each one in our language in the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.800

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.920

 Our tongues the wonders of God 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.780
 and they were all stunned and perplexed 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.520

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.189

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.630
 crucifying him whom God raised 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.489
 loose the pains of death by 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.090
 how much it was impossible to be retained 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.970
 for her because David says about him he saw the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.510
 Lord always in front of me because he is 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.640

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.319

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.930
 corruption you made me know the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.960

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.630
 with your presence 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.180
 brothers men you can say 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.120
 freely of the patriarch David who died 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.030
 and he was buried and his grave is with 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.130
 us to this day but being 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.020
 prophet and knowing that with oath 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.050
 God had sworn that his 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.730
 offspring in terms of meat 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.670
 I would lift the Christ to sit down 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.040
 on his throne seeing him before he spoke of the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.620
 resurrection of Christ that his soul does not 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.640
 was left in the hades nor his flesh saw 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.970
 corruption to this jesus resurrected god of 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.310
 which all of us are witnesses 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.650
 so exalted by the right hand of God 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.140
 and having received from the father in the 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.440
 promise of the holy spirit has poured out 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.630
 what you see joyce because 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.120
 David did not ascend to heaven but he 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.120
 same says the Lord said to my lord 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.970

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.700

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.310

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.250
 done Lord and Christ 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.370
 hearing this, they were composed from the heart and 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.070
 they told Pedro and the other apostles 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.220
 brothers men that we will make Peter 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.870
 He said repent and be baptized each one 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.139
 of you in the name of Jesus Christ 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.080
 for the forgiveness of sins and you will receive 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.060

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.520

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.610
 He testified and exhorted them saying thirst 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.740
 saved from this perverse generation like this 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.500
 that those who received his word were 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.710
 baptized and that day was added as 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.110
 3000 people and persevered in the 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.600
 doctrine of the apostles in communion 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.860

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.370
 all things and sold their 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:48.000
 properties and their assets and distributed them 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.860

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.259

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.900
 temple and breaking bread in the houses 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.449
 they ate together with joy and simplicity of 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.150
 heart praising God and having to 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.789
