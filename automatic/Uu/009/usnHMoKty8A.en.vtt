00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.440
 imitating elvis vetege by greasing the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.079
 tread on the neck there are 15 95 sounding 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.420

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.740

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.259

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.920
 that is best feared in my way I am 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.080
 4x4 fan makes me a very few example 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.720
 are examples I corner shot and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.299
 truths like temples with a lot for 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.490
 do everything to say your leave me the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.560
 details of my trip to me what is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.899
 take the wind take them far 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.899
 I get under the borge to feel its owner 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.299
 Time passes and you never come back alone 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.299
 no matter what we have done 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.110
 today the present is the only thing that matters 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.170
 and be with who you care about all the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.600
 time I can spend those q3 I walk away 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.329
 of vultures are like puppets and want 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 song and fly pérez I'm sorry I do not 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.130
 I live on twitter, I go out and listen to the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.140
 beats from the street and so it works up 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.939
 that the world finally explodes if life 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.220
 It's short and it's two days that you notice 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 struggling and sharing not putting 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.410
 price to favors or interest rates 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.930
 to my actions the infinite never 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510
 get away from my step of you or you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.610
 you imagine I want to keep what I was in 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.720
 ninety a kid on the court 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.270
 hooked on his pints 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 and I starting from the support keeping me 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.410
 that essence to bring her up to now 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.840
 hearing projects like I'm enjoying 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.110
 living the reality that others follow 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.110
 dreaming 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.090
 do not 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.810
 Time passes and you never come back alone 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.810
 no matter what we have done 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 the only thing that matters and be with whom 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.420
 you care as much as you can 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.659
