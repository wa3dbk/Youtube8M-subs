00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
just my previous video the main reason I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580 
just my previous video the main reason I
wanted<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.790> try<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.630> foundation<00:00:37.380> was

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
wanted to try out this foundation was

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.639 
wanted to try out this foundation was
because<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> summer<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:40.290> hot

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
because it is summer and it's really hot

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 
because it is summer and it's really hot
I<00:00:40.920> needed<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.640> new<00:00:41.879> foundation<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.020> more

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I needed a new foundation that is more

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.760 
I needed a new foundation that is more
lightweight<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.730> skin<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:46.200> needed<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
new foundation that's darker because I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.110 
new foundation that's darker because I
have<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.340> tanning<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:52.190> have<00:00:53.190> gotten<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.699> about

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
two shades darker and all of my

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
two shades darker and all of my
foundations<00:00:57.149> were<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.629> light<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.440> needed<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
foundations were too light so I needed a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.450 
foundations were too light so I needed a
new<00:00:59.370> shade<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.590> wanted<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
new shade and I need it and I wanted to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.500

try<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> different<00:01:03.090> foundation<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.530> thought

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
try a different foundation and I thought

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
try a different foundation and I thought
Mac<00:01:06.510> face<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:06.990> body<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:09.090> good

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
Mac face and body would be a good

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
Mac face and body would be a good
lightweight<00:01:10.200> foundation<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:11.010> try<00:01:11.189> with

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
lightweight foundation to try with

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.780 
lightweight foundation to try with
summer<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:13.130> really<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.580> like

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
summer time and I really really do like

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.890 
summer time and I really really do like
it<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> fact<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.210> really

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it for the fact that it is really really

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
it for the fact that it is really really
lightweight<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.970> very<00:01:21.479> thin

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
lightweight it is a very very thin

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
lightweight it is a very very thin
formula<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.280> liquidy<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.540> actually

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
formula very liquidy you can actually

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.700 
formula very liquidy you can actually
hear<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.290> how<00:01:28.650> liquidy<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.900> it's<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
hear it how liquidy it is it's a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.359 
hear it how liquidy it is it's a
water-based<00:01:32.509> formula<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:34.590> thing<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
water-based formula one thing about it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.600 
water-based formula one thing about it
is<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.270> no<00:01:36.600> SPF<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.310> are

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
is that it has no SPF so if you are

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.030 
is that it has no SPF so if you are
concerned<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.479> wearing<00:01:40.079> SPF<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
concerned about wearing SPF for the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.600 
concerned about wearing SPF for the
summertime

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
summertime

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
summertime
you<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.420> probably<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> wear<00:01:43.200> some

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you would probably have to wear some

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670 
you would probably have to wear some
kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> SPF<00:01:44.579> separately<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.439> mind

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
kind of SPF separately but I don't mind

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.840 
kind of SPF separately but I don't mind
it<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.310> SPF<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
it doesn't have SPF in it so this is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
it doesn't have SPF in it so this is
perfect<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.500> color<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
perfect for me and the color that I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.170 
perfect for me and the color that I
picked<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.240> match<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.689> skin<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.680> c4<00:01:57.350> so

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
picked up that match my skin was c4 so

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.370 
picked up that match my skin was c4 so
this<00:02:00.180> foundation<00:02:00.840> comes<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:04.200> has<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
this foundation comes in a it has a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
this foundation comes in a it has a
stopper<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.180> pour

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
stopper like that so you can just pour

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.279 
stopper like that so you can just pour
it<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:08.039> very<00:02:08.489> nice<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:10.080> at

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it out and it's very nice because the at

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
it out and it's very nice because the at
least<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.370> stopper<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
least there is a little stopper so you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.850 
least there is a little stopper so you
can

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
can

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.790 
can
control<00:02:13.520> how<00:02:14.240> much<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> want<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.170> little<00:02:15.590> bit

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
control how much you want a little bit

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.010 
control how much you want a little bit
and<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.100> said<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.360> very<00:02:20.750> thin

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and like I said it is a very thin

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.140 
and like I said it is a very thin
formula<00:02:21.530> very<00:02:22.070> lightweight<00:02:22.340> very

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
formula very lightweight very

full coverage you can kind of build it

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.630 
full coverage you can kind of build it
you<00:02:41.270> can<00:02:41.570> build<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.350> couple<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.800> layers<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.490> this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
you can build a couple of layers of this

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.540 
you can build a couple of layers of this
foundation<00:02:43.959> but<00:02:44.959> when<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.380> try<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.800> build<00:02:46.250> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
foundation but when I try to build a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.890 
foundation but when I try to build a
couple<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.180> layers<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.990> still<00:02:49.240> don't<00:02:50.240> quite<00:02:50.510> get

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
couple of layers I still don't quite get

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
a full coverage with it so I would say

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
a full coverage with it so I would say
it's<00:02:53.750> more<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> light<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.040> medium

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
it's more like a light to medium

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.830 
it's more like a light to medium
coverage<00:02:56.090> foundation<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:01.280> a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
coverage foundation and if you have a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.510 
coverage foundation and if you have a
lot<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.989> problems<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.830> your<00:03:03.980> skin<00:03:04.310> you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
lot of problems on your skin you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.930 
lot of problems on your skin you
probably<00:03:05.090> will<00:03:05.360> need<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.590> use<00:03:06.800> some<00:03:07.520> type<00:03:07.730> of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
probably will need to use some type of

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.990 
probably will need to use some type of
concealer<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.840> top<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:10.370> foundation

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
concealer on top of that this foundation

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.170 
concealer on top of that this foundation
in<00:03:11.150> my<00:03:11.330> opinion<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.489> good<00:03:13.489> for<00:03:13.700> any<00:03:13.850> type<00:03:13.940> of

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
in my opinion is good for any type of

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.080 
in my opinion is good for any type of
skin<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:15.470> doesn't<00:03:15.800> matter<00:03:16.160> if<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.580> have<00:03:16.610> dry

skin combination skin or oily skin

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.050 
skin combination skin or oily skin

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
simply because it dries to a more dewy

fingers<00:05:18.919> but<00:05:19.580> sometimes<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.450> using<00:05:20.720> a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
fingers but sometimes I like using a

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.670 
fingers but sometimes I like using a
stippling<00:05:21.530> brush<00:05:22.130> like<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:23.060> apply<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:24.410> use

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
stippling brush like this to apply I use

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.920 
stippling brush like this to apply I use

a stippling brush to apply it today and

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.620 
a stippling brush to apply it today and
then<00:05:27.140> I<00:05:27.350> finish<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.800> off<00:05:28.100> with<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.120> second

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
then I finish it off with like a second

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.050 
then I finish it off with like a second
layer<00:05:29.810> with<00:05:30.770> my<00:05:30.950> fingers<00:05:31.400> just<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.790> show<00:05:32.000> you

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.760 
layer with my fingers just to show you
guys<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:35.600> it<00:05:35.750> can<00:05:35.990> be<00:05:36.140> applied<00:05:36.470> with<00:05:36.500> a

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
guys so that it can be applied with a

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.890 
guys so that it can be applied with a
second<00:05:37.160> layer<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.790> with<00:05:37.970> your<00:05:38.150> fingers<00:05:38.510> and

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
second layer and with your fingers and

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.380 
second layer and with your fingers and
with<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.020> brush<00:05:39.320> but<00:05:40.070> I<00:05:40.370> was<00:05:40.610> suggest<00:05:41.000> using

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
with a brush but I was suggest using

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.300 
with a brush but I was suggest using
like<00:05:41.600> a<00:05:41.630> stippling<00:05:42.020> brush<00:05:42.229> like<00:05:42.770> this<00:05:43.070> I

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
like a stippling brush like this I

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.760 
like a stippling brush like this I
wouldn't<00:05:43.760> use<00:05:44.120> like<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.419> dense<00:05:44.930> brush<00:05:45.440> because

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
wouldn't use like a dense brush because

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.770 
wouldn't use like a dense brush because
I<00:05:45.950> think<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.370> might<00:05:46.580> absorb<00:05:46.970> all<00:05:47.390> of<00:05:47.450> this

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
I think it might absorb all of this

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.050 
I think it might absorb all of this
foundation<00:05:48.260> since<00:05:48.890> it's<00:05:49.100> like<00:05:49.370> a<00:05:49.400> water-based

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
foundation since it's like a water-based

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.510 
foundation since it's like a water-based
foundation<00:05:50.830> otherwise<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.070> would<00:05:52.250> have<00:05:52.280> to

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
foundation otherwise you would have to

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.390 
foundation otherwise you would have to
use<00:05:52.640> a<00:05:52.669> ton<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.570> product<00:05:54.020> if<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:54.860> do<00:05:55.070> build

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
use a ton of the product if you do build

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.000 
use a ton of the product if you do build
it<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:56.210> couple<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.900> layers<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.620> doesn't<00:05:57.890> really

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
it a couple of layers it doesn't really

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.210 
it a couple of layers it doesn't really
cake<00:05:58.370> up<00:05:58.640> or<00:05:58.910> anything<00:05:59.150> since<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.229> finished<00:06:00.740> to

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
cake up or anything since it finished to

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.820 
cake up or anything since it finished to
more<00:06:01.580> like<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.910> dewy<00:06:02.210> finish<00:06:02.360> but<00:06:03.200> other<00:06:03.560> than

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
more like a dewy finish but other than

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.909 
more like a dewy finish but other than
that<00:06:03.890> it's<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.490> very<00:06:04.520> nice<00:06:05.000> foundation<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:06.169> think

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
that it's a very nice foundation I think

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.880 
that it's a very nice foundation I think
it<00:06:07.190> can<00:06:07.669> be<00:06:07.700> compared<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.440> Chanel<00:06:10.100> aqua

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
it can be compared to the Chanel aqua

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.420 
it can be compared to the Chanel aqua
you<00:06:12.890> don't<00:06:13.070> know<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:13.490> name<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:14.150> aqua

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430
