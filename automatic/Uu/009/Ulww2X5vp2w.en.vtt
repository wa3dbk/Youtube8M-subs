00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 little footage of beaten because you have 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.170
 there is so much to play on beat with 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.780
 sniper even though brothers are 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 truly a scandalous thing goes I seek 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.789
 to commit as much as possible anyway 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 I'm here because so many of you have me 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 asked so many questions I am here with this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 comment to try to answer 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 more or less all 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.269
 then the question I wanted 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.400
 talk about who I thank you very much 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.320
 of the fact that you have all understood that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's not the boxes that count brothers 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 but it is the people who have fun on and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.989
 this truly total love 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
 we live from the bottom of our hearts because 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.180
 understand the spirit of truth perfectly 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 gamer I will always love you for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:52.199
 this however is the first question to which 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.760
 I want so much to answer is what is like 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.789
 you think this next gen 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 now brothers the next gen that by now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 it would be currenti people that are already 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 arrived a fortnight america on the 22nd 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.769
 the former boss of 29 the sony again in in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.650
 in Europe 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.220
 I wanted to say that then obvious that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 at the beginning the impact next gen nexgen 1 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 graphically speaking he does not see it so much 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 because in any case the computers as we know 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.420
 so there are are at these levels of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 graphic for a long time indeed i 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 brothers the same other day I had 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 tried putting me fallout 3 on pc ad 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 ultra and it really looks like another 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 world 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.490
 but what I wanted to talk to you about 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 I've already mentioned in the previous video 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.530
 now when six minutes remain for 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.930
 tell me and it's not so much the feeling 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.229
 how the game looks on your TV 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.509
 but the feeling of control that then the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 game life through the new console 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.920
 that is, I swear to go through battlefields 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.159
 3 oba dips 4 also in this case in the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.570
 from previous consoles to these new ones 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.579
 I swear the feeling is not the feeling 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.920
 I know how I will live the impact a 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.470
 play 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:18.090
 another world another world then how 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.280
 it looks like ps4 but the ps4 externally is 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.800
 a truly unlock design looks kind 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.760
 the cube of the transformers is flat however east 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 fire is kind is so it is little high and little 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.100
 wide but deep is a little thicker 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.270
 let's say the ps3 slim is very small 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.850
 really very comfortable 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.470
 quietly in your desk 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.269
 how dashboard looks like the dashboard 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.830
 which is not called so now but not me 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.890
 I never remember that name knotted that 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.780
 stuff alone the dashboard really is 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.269
 simple brothers is like having of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.370
 good kind of smartphone with all the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.340
 small icons but placed horizontally 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.900
 ie joyce aligned horizontally 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.690
 how amazing I always told you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.410
 that is the joyce card playstation of 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.750
 play introduced these this l2 r2 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.519
 a little bit curved wider than 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.380
 practically just hook up 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.819
 then your indexes perfectly 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.580
 even the fact itself 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.190
 let's say what kind on kodo battlefield not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.570
 you shoot still you don't shoot with l 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.810
 an r1 that you can always want 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.010
 change them but you shoot with l2 r2 is a lot 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.870
 more responsive because the controls are 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.489
 perfect and right under the sole 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.440
 test your enemies ' reach now 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.989
 of the xbox but I had no way to 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.480
 try it if not sometimes so a 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.329
 at videogame fairs but I have not not 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.660
 got to try it just to give you 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.329
 a personal impact then call of duty 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.450
 I still don't have brothers, but not taste 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.250
 as soon as I get there I will show you vi 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.370
 I'll show you some footage I'll give you 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.750
 also my impressions of that game 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.840
 of how the feeling on this new one 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.090
 console but one thing also in 3d me is 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.049
 was that I always talk about playstation 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.359
 because now I have the time to 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.950
 installation is really fast ie me 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.410
 I thought it was much longer but in 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.540
 reality for example when you when the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.220
 playstation is installing you 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.560
 battlefield is installing you the type 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.280
 rest of the multiplayer mode you can 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.530
 already begin the campaign 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.810
 quietly or play other games 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.139
 or see the internet make do 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.699
 something else to play 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.099
 company while installing the same thing 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.030
 applies to other games for example 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.860
 fright 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.479
 when i was when i was installing 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.969
 you could do very well to one 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.979
 a friendly as well as a part already of 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.810
 his part barcelona real barcelona 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.900
 madrid, you play this game now 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.370
 which I really wanted to tell you and really 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.900
 these feelings of impact then now 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.029
 I don't know if you can even see 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.249
 however, we note that we are no longer 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.389
 in on previous consoles because this 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.180
 map if I'm not mistaken it's called 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.229
 also flo del I don't remember type 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.680
 flooded a stuff like that between 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.270
 the other was also the one in which it makes 0 of it 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.069
 had played in the in the lan of 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.479
 battlefield that was live on xbox 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.759
 I don't know if you really remember 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.139
 very great makes 0 anyway I have to say 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.689
 that the fact of this battle film with 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.349
 the sniper is truly extraordinary 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.110
 extraordinary even if I have to admit 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:15.129
 which sometimes really see a barrett 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.580
 that from two centimeters cheer double blind 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.050
 fight market and dispare type 2 or 3 times 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.520
 that from a person like me 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.900
 brothers joe I always owe it to him 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.000
 admit may give some discomfort even 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.460
 if it beats dm wonderful branches but I know 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.529
 very well that if the snipers were one 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.240
 shot one kill ie most i 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.949
 snipers were one shot missing from 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.689
 any distance would be too ever 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.639
 over paolo I think everyone should be 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.930
 out and about with the battlefield sniper 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.629
 but the impressive thing is this 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.789
 bacterium else and that there are so many 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.039
 misery every type 90 weapon 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.789
 accessories are a thousand grips then 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.680
 brothers this is what I wanted to tell you if 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.520
 you will get a new console at Christmas 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.520
 you already want me next year 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.819
 that I would be honored to read 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.370
 your comments on what you think 6 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.560
 on what feeling via given try these 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.419
 new consoles, as you are 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.159
 heard me last now and maybe of 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.349
 money and lost a little too much on this 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.060
 question that was the first in the 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.289
 comments from the previous video but not there 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.389
 worry because I will bring others 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.009
 comments other movies where he will respond to 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.259
 all your questions because for me 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.490
 brothers is really an honor to be able to 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.319
 answer all your questions 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.469
 because I think that gamers 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.300
 have something in common that is not 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.969
 so much the passion but the heart the 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.780
 fun that put us in this 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.860
 passion 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.870
 the passion shows him that it is one thing 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.550
 really that unites us in a way 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.780
 amazing there excellent kind a 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.510
 all one 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.370
 we have different names but we are all with 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.380
 the same passion here we can billions 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.150
 of billions names of consoles but we are 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.880
 in the end it is always people who play and it is 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.040
 that amazing stuff is something else 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.690
 I wanted to tell you and precisely what will come 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.370

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.940
