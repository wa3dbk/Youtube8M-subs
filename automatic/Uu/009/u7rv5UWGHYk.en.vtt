00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
cover on my camera so it's a bit of a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.319 
cover on my camera so it's a bit of a
wasted<00:02:14.560> video<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.910> it's<00:02:16.180> an

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
wasted video but it is it's an

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.680 
wasted video but it is it's an
