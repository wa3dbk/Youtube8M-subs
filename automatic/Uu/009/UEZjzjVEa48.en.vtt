recreate yourself so your belly and a
bit<00:04:49.360> underneath<00:04:49.720> because<00:04:50.379> otherwise<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:51.039> you

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
bit underneath because otherwise and you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.610 
bit underneath because otherwise and you
won't<00:04:52.180> get<00:04:52.360> further<00:04:52.629> out<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.990> wall<00:04:53.229> to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
won't get further out on the wall to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.960 
won't get further out on the wall to
eventually<00:04:54.580> fall<00:04:54.880> over<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.289> place<00:04:56.530> your

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
eventually fall over so you place your

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.320 
eventually fall over so you place your
private<00:04:57.970> parts<00:04:58.240> on<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.569> wall<00:04:59.550> and<00:05:00.550> then<00:05:00.940> with

private parts on the wall and then with
your<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:02.229> can<00:05:02.349> obviously<00:05:02.530> do<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.800> right<00:05:03.009> there

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
your you can obviously do it right there

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.980 
your you can obviously do it right there
than<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.639> handed<00:05:04.419> or<00:05:04.599> if<00:05:04.690> your<00:05:04.840> left

his hand is the right hand and you put

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.080 
his hand is the right hand and you put
it<00:05:11.800> on<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.039> back<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.520> wall<00:05:12.669> has<00:05:12.880> leave

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
it on the back of the wall has leave

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.520 
it on the back of the wall has leave
there<00:05:13.330> go<00:05:13.419> straight<00:05:13.599> in<00:05:13.719> there<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.139> that<00:05:14.169> way

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
there go straight in there so that way

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.040 
there go straight in there so that way
you<00:05:14.590> won't<00:05:14.889> fall<00:05:15.190> forward<00:05:15.639> the<00:05:16.389> second<00:05:16.840> hand

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
you won't fall forward the second hand

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.399 
you won't fall forward the second hand
as<00:05:17.349> you<00:05:17.889> lean<00:05:18.099> down<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.639> put<00:05:18.969> on<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.810> front

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
as you lean down you put on the front

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.899 
as you lean down you put on the front
piece<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:20.949> wall<00:05:21.129> that<00:05:21.400> way<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.699> will<00:05:21.849> help

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
piece of the wall that way it will help

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.180 
piece of the wall that way it will help
you<00:05:22.270> push<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:22.930> way<00:05:23.469> your<00:05:23.650> head<00:05:23.860> will<00:05:24.069> not

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
you push and that way your head will not

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.279 
you push and that way your head will not
hit<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.460> wall<00:05:24.639> then<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.180> set<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.719> the<00:05:26.110> last

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
hit the wall then the set the the last

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.950 
hit the wall then the set the the last
thing<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.710> do<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.819> feet<00:05:28.060> now<00:05:28.569> there's<00:05:28.780> two

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
thing to do is the feet now there's two

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.350 
thing to do is the feet now there's two
ways<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.259> doing<00:05:29.409> this<00:05:29.710> one<00:05:30.310> way<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.759> doing<00:05:31.150> it's

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
ways of doing this one way is doing it's

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.270 
ways of doing this one way is doing it's
falling<00:05:31.719> straight<00:05:31.990> forward<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.680> then<00:05:33.130> with

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
falling straight forward and then with

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.459 
falling straight forward and then with
your<00:05:33.490> feet<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:33.819> kick<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.539> you<00:05:35.139> fall

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
your feet you kick and you fall

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.610 
your feet you kick and you fall
literally<00:05:36.250> if<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:37.539> have<00:05:37.930> you're<00:05:38.110> looking<00:05:38.500> at

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
literally if you have you're looking at

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.149 
literally if you have you're looking at
it<00:05:38.740> as<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.580> complete<00:05:40.240> degree<00:05:40.539> angle<00:05:40.930> or<00:05:41.159> the

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
it as a complete degree angle or the

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.769 
it as a complete degree angle or the
other<00:05:42.310> way<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.610> dishes<00:05:43.029> will<00:05:43.180> securely<00:05:43.509> is

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
other way the dishes will securely is

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.600 
other way the dishes will securely is
going<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.259> side<00:05:44.469> for<00:05:44.740> example<00:05:44.800> how<00:05:45.279> Amelia

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
going to the side for example how Amelia

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.360 
going to the side for example how Amelia
with<00:05:45.729> our<00:05:45.849> demonstrate<00:05:46.710> his<00:05:47.710> feet<00:05:48.009> went<00:05:48.250> to

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
with our demonstrate his feet went to

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.820 
with our demonstrate his feet went to
the<00:05:48.460> side<00:05:48.669> now<00:05:49.090> obviously<00:05:49.509> this<00:05:49.719> trick<00:05:50.650> is

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
the side now obviously this trick is

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.200 
the side now obviously this trick is
quite<00:05:51.039> useful<00:05:51.310> because<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:51.969> come<00:05:52.090> up

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
quite useful because if you come up

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.430 
quite useful because if you come up
against<00:05:52.449> warn<00:05:52.659> you<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.930> get<00:05:53.080> down<00:05:53.169> quickly

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
against warn you to get down quickly

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.140 
against warn you to get down quickly
there's<00:05:54.069> a<00:05:54.219> very<00:05:54.400> good<00:05:54.580> way<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:54.699> doing<00:05:54.880> it<00:05:55.060> if

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
there's a very good way of doing it if

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.600 
there's a very good way of doing it if
you<00:05:55.240> don't<00:05:55.419> want<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:55.690> jump<00:05:55.900> cook<00:05:56.529> or<00:05:56.740> jump<00:05:57.460> all

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
you don't want to jump cook or jump all

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.870 
you don't want to jump cook or jump all
the<00:05:57.639> way<00:05:57.759> down<00:05:58.029> as<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.300> local<00:05:58.539> precision<00:05:58.840> job<00:05:59.880> so

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
the way down as a local precision job so

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.860 
the way down as a local precision job so
you<00:06:01.300> can<00:06:01.419> either<00:06:01.539> do<00:06:01.779> it<00:06:01.810> fully<00:06:03.210> over<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.509> like

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
you can either do it fully over so like

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.379 
you can either do it fully over so like
your<00:06:05.770> feet<00:06:06.009> will<00:06:06.159> go<00:06:06.250> over<00:06:06.699> your<00:06:06.880> head

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
your feet will go over your head

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.629 
your feet will go over your head
this<00:06:07.900> is<00:06:08.020> quite<00:06:08.259> dangerous<00:06:08.500> because<00:06:08.860> if<00:06:09.490> you

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
this is quite dangerous because if you

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.399 
this is quite dangerous because if you
don't<00:06:09.849> do<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.060> completely<00:06:10.599> right<00:06:10.779> you<00:06:11.229> will

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
don't do it completely right you will

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.019 
don't do it completely right you will
hit<00:06:11.590> your<00:06:11.620> head<00:06:11.889> on<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.130> wall<00:06:12.159> or<00:06:12.520> you<00:06:12.580> won't

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
hit your head on the wall or you won't

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:14.820 
hit your head on the wall or you won't
make<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.330> complete<00:06:13.750> jump<00:06:14.020> and<00:06:14.169> you<00:06:14.229> may<00:06:14.349> fall<00:06:14.590> on

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
make a complete jump and you may fall on

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.100 
make a complete jump and you may fall on
your<00:06:15.039> back<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:15.520> it's<00:06:15.880> quite<00:06:16.090> dangerous<00:06:16.300> we

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
your back and it's quite dangerous we

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.730 
your back and it's quite dangerous we
will<00:06:17.469> try<00:06:18.009> and<00:06:19.050> master<00:06:20.050> this<00:06:20.139> technique<00:06:20.319> a<00:06:20.590> bit

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
will try and master this technique a bit

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.670 
will try and master this technique a bit
better<00:06:20.889> and<00:06:21.219> we<00:06:21.279> will<00:06:21.930> upload<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:22.990> tutorial<00:06:23.199> of

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
better and we will upload a tutorial of

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.139 
better and we will upload a tutorial of
it<00:06:23.889> soon<00:06:25.919> now<00:06:26.919> there's<00:06:27.130> a<00:06:27.219> catalog<00:06:28.649> so<00:06:29.649> and

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
it soon now there's a catalog so and

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:34.590 
it soon now there's a catalog so and
that<00:06:31.149> is<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.509> most<00:06:32.190> safer<00:06:33.190> way<00:06:33.449> put

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
that is the most safer way put

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.110 
that is the most safer way put
private<00:06:35.350> parts<00:06:35.590> on<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.800> wall<00:06:35.980> you<00:06:36.610> fall<00:06:36.940> down

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
private parts on the wall you fall down
