00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.499
 Running has always been an important part of my life 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.269
 I liked it since I was just a kid 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.740
 how I could not go to school 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 I spent all day in the mountains trotting from one place to another 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.640
 it was so fast, that in military service, 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.620
 My sergeant chose me to distribute the messages from the barracks. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.560
 I still remember what he told me 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.940
 you, do not run, fly 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.860
 and that's what I did 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 I was flying 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.960
 when I graduated 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 I wanted to be a cyclist 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.570
 but I had to leave it because of an accident, 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.280
 even so, I kept practicing sports 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.430
 and that, that in those times 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.470
 the people believed that the athletes were all crazy 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.980
 at 65 I was encouraged to participate in popular races 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.190
 urban miles, half marathons, marathons, 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.840
 I was a veteran, but I reached the finish ahead of others much younger than me 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.670
 sport has taught me many important things 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590
 that nothing in this life comes without effort and enthusiasm 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 that you have to always look forward 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 look for new challenges to overcome 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.020
 although they may seem impossible 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.010
 What is my dream? 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.150
 Run the New York marathon! 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.110
 I will not be able to win it anymore 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.130
 but if I can be the first broker over 100 years to finish it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.320
 Because no, I'll spare and I still have a few years ahead to prepare it 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.740
 time is something relative 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.380
 everything depends on how you use it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.880
 you have realized? 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.989
 fly when you do what you really like 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.699
 I know it well 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.459
 because every time I put on my running shoes 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.860
 I take a lot of years off 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.520
 I feel so young and light 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.200
 I think I could fly 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.920
 Do not run, 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 Flying
