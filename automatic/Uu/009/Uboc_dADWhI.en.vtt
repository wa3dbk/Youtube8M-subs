00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it all really starts with the aircraft

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.990 
it all really starts with the aircraft
behind<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> aircraft<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
behind is now we have the aircraft and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
behind is now we have the aircraft and
they'll<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> carry<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> daily<00:01:55.680> inspection

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they'll have to carry a daily inspection

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.580 
they'll have to carry a daily inspection
task<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.850> routine<00:01:57.780> task<00:01:58.140> where<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.409> walk

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
task a routine task where they walk

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
task a routine task where they walk
around<00:01:58.890> check<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.340> aircraft<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.390> idea

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
around check the aircraft and the idea

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.279 
around check the aircraft and the idea
is<00:02:00.869> they'll<00:02:01.289> find<00:02:01.530> faults<00:02:01.920> maybe<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.289> then

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
is they'll find faults maybe and then

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.690 
is they'll find faults maybe and then
faults<00:02:04.679> will<00:02:04.830> lead<00:02:05.009> them<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.550> other

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
faults will lead them on to the other

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.690 
faults will lead them on to the other
modules<00:02:06.149> within<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.229> aircraft<00:02:07.619> industry<00:02:08.130> if

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
modules within the aircraft industry if

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
modules within the aircraft industry if
you'd<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.209> stroll<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> way<00:02:09.989> we'll

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you'd go a little stroll this way we'll

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.240 
you'd go a little stroll this way we'll
see<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.380> engines

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.590 

obviously<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.610> engines<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.300> from<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
obviously this engines not from the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.180 
obviously this engines not from the
aircraft<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.170> seen<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.069> make

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
aircraft it is seen that we have to make

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
aircraft it is seen that we have to make
it<00:02:20.340> modular<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.880> get<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.690> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it modular we get what we can in this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
it modular we get what we can in this
engine<00:02:22.680> they'll<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.040> checking<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:23.459> how<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
engine they'll be checking out how it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.059 
engine they'll be checking out how it
works<00:02:24.540> why<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.020> works<00:02:25.350> if<00:02:25.560> there's<00:02:25.740> any<00:02:25.890> damage

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
works why it works if there's any damage

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.270 
works why it works if there's any damage
within<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.640> may<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.780> also<00:02:28.280> there's

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
within it may be and also there's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
within it may be and also there's
another<00:02:29.340> secondary<00:02:30.120> task<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.990> how<00:02:31.230> we

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
another secondary task on this on how we

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.290 
another secondary task on this on how we
get<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.800> power<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.400> work<00:02:32.580> how<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.030> get<00:02:33.239> that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
get that power to work how we get that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.360 
get that power to work how we get that
engine<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.840> work<00:02:33.959> there's<00:02:34.290> two<00:02:34.530> tasks<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.220> this

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
engine to work there's two tasks on this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.880 
engine to work there's two tasks on this
engine<00:02:35.550> module<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.489> over<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.410> we<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
engine module and over here we have the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.890 
engine module and over here we have the
flight<00:02:41.459> control<00:02:41.850> rigging<00:02:42.209> obviously<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.810> want

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
flight control rigging obviously we want

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840 
flight control rigging obviously we want
the<00:02:43.020> aircraft<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.650> able<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.010> take<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.459> land

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the aircraft to be able to take off land

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.320 
the aircraft to be able to take off land
turn<00:02:45.569> left<00:02:45.870> turn<00:02:46.050> right<00:02:46.110> roll<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:48.120> that's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
turn left turn right roll and that's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.120 
turn left turn right roll and that's
very<00:02:48.720> important<00:02:49.200> ideas<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> control<00:02:49.950> rig

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
very important ideas get a control rig

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.530 
very important ideas get a control rig
incorrectly<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.970> that's<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:51.420> we're

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
incorrectly and that's what we're

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.809 
incorrectly and that's what we're
testing<00:02:51.720> here

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.080 

so<00:03:00.480> what<00:03:01.159> what<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.249> the<00:03:02.370> hardest<00:03:02.640> part<00:03:02.760> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so what what is the hardest part you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.349 
so what what is the hardest part you
find<00:03:03.329> for<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.599> competitors<00:03:04.819> for<00:03:05.819> them<00:03:05.969> yeah

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
find for the competitors for them yeah

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.989 
find for the competitors for them yeah
there<00:03:06.959> are<00:03:07.109> known<00:03:07.349> exposing<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.249> it<00:03:08.549> syrupy

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:08.999 
there are known exposing it it syrupy

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.800 
there are known exposing it it syrupy
and<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.239> knowing<00:03:09.389> what<00:03:09.569> they're<00:03:09.659> going<00:03:09.749> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and not knowing what they're going to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.369 
and not knowing what they're going to
make<00:03:10.670> or<00:03:11.670> what<00:03:12.150> we're<00:03:12.269> going<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.599> I'm<00:03:13.200> gonna

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
make or what we're going to do I'm gonna

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.009 
make or what we're going to do I'm gonna
find<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:15.269> details<00:03:15.629> have<00:03:15.989> been

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
find out that the details have been

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.300 
find out that the details have been
changed<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.680> bit<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:16.950> something<00:03:17.219> like

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
changed a little bit of something like

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.179 
changed a little bit of something like
that<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:17.849> that's<00:03:17.969> the<00:03:18.150> hard<00:03:18.329> bit<00:03:18.510> for

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
that and that's that's the hard bit for

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.800 
that and that's that's the hard bit for
okay<00:03:20.189> over<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.209> we've<00:03:21.389> got<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> sheetmetal

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
okay over there we've got a sheetmetal

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
okay over there we've got a sheetmetal
task<00:03:22.290> which<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.069> where<00:03:23.219> they're<00:03:23.310> putting<00:03:23.430> two

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
task which is where they're putting two

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.160 
task which is where they're putting two
bits<00:03:23.939> of<00:03:24.000> metal<00:03:24.120> together<00:03:24.329> after<00:03:24.930> bending

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
bits of metal together after bending

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110 
bits of metal together after bending
them<00:03:25.469> and<00:03:26.189> they've<00:03:26.340> got<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.489> bit<00:03:26.700> because<00:03:26.939> that

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
them and they've got a bit because that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.729 
them and they've got a bit because that
can<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.299> used<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:27.629> control<00:03:28.200> ones<00:03:28.439> that<00:03:28.620> go

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
can be used for control ones that go

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.679 
can be used for control ones that go
down<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.069> side<00:03:29.249> of<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> aircraft<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.599> we

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
down the side of the aircraft so we

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.610 
down the side of the aircraft so we
don't<00:03:30.780> want<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.079> passengers<00:03:31.499> in<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
don't want the passengers in the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.920 
don't want the passengers in the
aircraft<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.069> see<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.269> we<00:03:33.419> hide<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.840> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
aircraft to see this so we hide it but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.349 
aircraft to see this so we hide it but
they<00:03:34.049> need<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.349> be<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:35.430> certain<00:03:35.819> tolerances

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
they need to be at certain tolerances

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.149 
they need to be at certain tolerances
with<00:03:36.900> certain<00:03:37.200> dimensions<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.829> that's<00:03:37.980> what

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
with certain dimensions and that's what

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.869 
with certain dimensions and that's what
we're<00:03:38.280> checking<00:03:38.609> here<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:41.579> why<00:03:41.699> don't<00:03:41.849> you

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
we're checking here so why don't you

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.339 
we're checking here so why don't you
tell<00:03:42.090> us<00:03:42.120> about<00:03:42.510> what's<00:03:42.840> next<00:03:42.930> year<00:03:43.230> right
