00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
the kind of was but it was very

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.420

difficult<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.680> use<00:05:30.770> it<00:05:30.950> took<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.100> lot<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.310> time

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
difficult to use it took a lot of time

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.340 
difficult to use it took a lot of time
to<00:05:31.700> actually<00:05:31.820> work<00:05:32.210> in<00:05:32.390> in<00:05:32.570> certain<00:05:33.169> countries

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
to actually work in in certain countries

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.780 
to actually work in in certain countries
you<00:05:33.590> couldn't<00:05:33.860> even<00:05:33.919> do<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:34.430> all<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.550> that

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
you couldn't even do it and all of that

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.730 
you couldn't even do it and all of that
stuff<00:05:35.060> but<00:05:35.479> now<00:05:35.660> it's<00:05:35.870> much<00:05:36.020> easier<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.410> do<00:05:36.620> is

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
stuff but now it's much easier to do is

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.170 
stuff but now it's much easier to do is
just<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:37.010> couple<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.340> clicks<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.729> that's<00:05:38.000> it

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
just a couple of clicks and that's it

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.330 
just a couple of clicks and that's it
you<00:05:38.270> can<00:05:38.419> request<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.840> refund<00:05:39.020> so<00:05:39.800> I<00:05:39.830> mean<00:05:40.100> the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
you can request a refund so I mean the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.890 
you can request a refund so I mean the
fact<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.610> there<00:05:40.790> is<00:05:40.910> such<00:05:41.090> an<00:05:41.210> easily<00:05:41.630> usable

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
fact that there is such an easily usable

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.050 
fact that there is such an easily usable
refund<00:05:42.440> system<00:05:42.800> obviously<00:05:43.010> means<00:05:43.760> that

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
refund system obviously means that

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.840 
refund system obviously means that
refunds<00:05:44.930> will<00:05:45.350> go<00:05:45.590> up<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:45.979> think<00:05:46.490> devs<00:05:46.729> have

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850
