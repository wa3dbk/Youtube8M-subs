take my steps on this field whereas on

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.819 
take my steps on this field whereas on
the<00:00:49.050> PureView<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> Lumia<00:00:50.940> 920<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.680> won't

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the PureView on the Lumia 920 you won't

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.810 
the PureView on the Lumia 920 you won't
actually<00:00:52.949> notice<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
actually notice that much of a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
actually notice that much of a
difference<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
difference because it has this very

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
difference because it has this very
weird<00:00:55.980> cool<00:00:57.020> stabilization<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.440> actually

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
weird cool stabilization that actually

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000 
weird cool stabilization that actually
ends<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.730> looking<00:00:59.850> quite<00:01:00.510> nice<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.109> practice

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
ends up looking quite nice in practice

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.619 
ends up looking quite nice in practice
but<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.910> something<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> wouldn't

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
but it's something that you wouldn't

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
but it's something that you wouldn't
actually<00:01:03.780> notice<00:01:04.229> unless<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.159> up

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually notice unless you put it up

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.420 
actually notice unless you put it up
against<00:01:05.670> another<00:01:05.729> phone<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
against another phone so we're going to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
against another phone so we're going to
take<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.760> video<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> p.o<00:01:09.840> view<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.290> one

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
take one video with the p.o view and one

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
take one video with the p.o view and one
video<00:01:11.070> versus<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> 8x<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.780> check

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
video versus the 8x which you can check

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
video versus the 8x which you can check
out<00:01:12.990> later<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:14.420> yeah<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.310> hopefully<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.700> will

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
out later but yeah so hopefully you will

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.899 
out later but yeah so hopefully you will
notice<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.479> difference<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:19.700> camera<00:01:20.700> quality

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
notice the difference in camera quality

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
notice the difference in camera quality
and<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.130> audio<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:24.060> both<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.630> rich

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and in the audio they both have rich

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
and in the audio they both have rich
recording<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.470> p.o<00:01:28.470> view<00:01:28.650> 808<00:01:28.920> likewise

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
recording but the p.o view 808 likewise

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.480 
recording but the p.o view 808 likewise
in<00:01:29.400> stereo<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> mva<00:01:30.710> Lumia<00:01:31.710> 920<00:01:32.100> records

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in stereo but the mva Lumia 920 records

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.469 
in stereo but the mva Lumia 920 records
in<00:01:32.579> mono<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> yeah<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
in mono so yeah that's about it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.190 
in mono so yeah that's about it
hopefully<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:38.040> video<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
hopefully this video will make a bit of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.609 
hopefully this video will make a bit of
a<00:01:40.259> difference<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.110> thing<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
a difference now one more thing I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.310 
a difference now one more thing I
haven't<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.130> demonstrated<00:01:44.729> yet<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
haven't actually demonstrated yet is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
haven't actually demonstrated yet is
that<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> P<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> idiot<00:01:47.490> does<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.909> one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that the P of you idiot does have one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
that the P of you idiot does have one
nice<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.470> ability<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
nice little ability and that is the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.719 
nice little ability and that is the
ability<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.210> zoom<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:52.490> right<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.670> you

ability to zoom in right now you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.749 
ability to zoom in right now you
probably<00:01:54.090> noticed<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.759> 808

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
probably noticed that on the 808

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
probably noticed that on the 808
PureView<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.630> zoomed<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:59.250> on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739

still of course my hand is trembling a
little<00:02:23.799> bit<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.459> holding<00:02:24.579> two

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
little bit because I'm holding two

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.869 
little bit because I'm holding two
phones<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.860> will<00:02:27.069> be<00:02:27.099> interesting<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.640> see

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
phones but it will be interesting to see

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.339 
phones but it will be interesting to see
how<00:02:27.909> much<00:02:28.329> of<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.510> difference<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.900> makes<00:02:29.110> on

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
how much of a difference that makes on

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.869 
how much of a difference that makes on
the<00:02:29.799> PureView<00:02:30.340> 808<00:02:30.489> versus<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.540> OAS<00:02:32.049> on<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
the PureView 808 versus the OAS on the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.080 
the PureView 808 versus the OAS on the
Lumia<00:02:33.879> 920<00:02:35.430> hopefully<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.579> will<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.760> able<00:02:36.879> to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
Lumia 920 hopefully you will be able to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.220 
Lumia 920 hopefully you will be able to
actually<00:02:37.299> notice<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.810> difference<00:02:38.109> between

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
actually notice the difference between

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.059 
actually notice the difference between
the<00:02:38.799> two<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:40.379> from<00:02:41.379> where<00:02:41.530> I'm<00:02:41.620> standing<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
the two but from where I'm standing it

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.080 
the two but from where I'm standing it
doesn't<00:02:42.250> actually<00:02:42.340> seem<00:02:42.609> like<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.849> much<00:02:42.879> of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
doesn't actually seem like that much of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.280 
doesn't actually seem like that much of
a<00:02:43.120> difference<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:44.140> let's<00:02:44.680> see<00:02:44.859> how<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.010> goes
