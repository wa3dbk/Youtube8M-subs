00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.529
 it's a club where I did not imagine 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.849
 did that have a scope in the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.669
 whole world as important it's 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.590
 true that the real madrid is known 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.109
 all over the world my friends to fans 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 all over the world and I did not know 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 not how it was it was a club 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.070
 important that there was an impact too 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 great in the world yes of course 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 it's a big motivation it's true 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.110
 that it would be historic 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.350
 and it's an interesting challenge we have 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 we have a team that is capable of 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:54.750
 achieve that kind of performance so 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.420
 so we will try to do it at this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.989
 level there of the competition every 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.550
 teams are are good and that's right 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.060
 that it's always matches 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.460
 difficult but I think if if we 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 plays as a team and collectively as 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.750
 we know how to do it we have the opportunity to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.750
 win to make a good result 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.240
 a lot of emotion we talked about emotion 

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.450
 so the first question is true 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 that it was this particular it was 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.319
 very emotional that it is before the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.649
 match at the level of the stress of the 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.310
 pressure or even after with the joy that 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.050
 had so 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.270
 so that's really what I remember 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's a very human moment to turn 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.009
 there are not many differences 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.649
 between Spain and France at 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.380
 level of culture but it's true that 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.450
 here is a small shift we have eaten 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.410
 a little later so so that's true 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.920
 it's a little cooler 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.849
 people do more napping this is true 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.849
 it's more it's more relaxed 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.429
 I was necessarily very very very 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.890
 glad it's true that it's a pride 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.709
 to be able to play for his country 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.980
 so it's a lot of joy to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.710
 responsibility to May 6 but for me 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 it's a chance and that's why 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:26.670
 I took advantage of every moment I 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.180
 never had a big idol but but that's 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.010
 true that not the extend little zidane or 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.690
 it made us all dream so 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.900
 so if I have to quote a player yes 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.360
 it's true that I would like him 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 I like to talk to my family 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.670
 football friends i like for example 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 talk about them tactically or 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 details with with my brother where my father 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.550
 so I would say with my family with my 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.180
 to have a thank you a big thank you for 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.980
 their support and then and then who 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 continue to support us and it's in 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.890
 important moments like that when we 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.720
 needs them and it's true that we 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.069
 have always supported and I hope who 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.920
 is in the important moments they 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.819
 will be will be even more present and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.819
 just finished lice
