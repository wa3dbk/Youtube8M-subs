and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.590> takes<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.340> endless<00:00:47.550> runner

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and it takes the kind of endless runner

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
and it takes the kind of endless runner
concept<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.200> new<00:00:49.350> direction<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
concept in a new direction because the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.020 
concept in a new direction because the
level<00:00:50.340> doesn't<00:00:50.670> end<00:00:50.879> until<00:00:51.239> well<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.469> die<00:00:53.030> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
level doesn't end until well you die so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
level doesn't end until well you die so
you're<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:54.870> competing<00:00:55.350> against<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.739> own

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you're really competing against your own

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000 
you're really competing against your own
reflexes<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> how<00:00:57.449> gnarly<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.530> computer<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
reflexes and how gnarly the computer is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
reflexes and how gnarly the computer is
going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.899> throwing<00:01:00.899> random<00:01:01.170> things<00:01:01.620> at

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
going to be throwing random things at

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
going to be throwing random things at
you<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.219> fast<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> move<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> way

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you how fast can you move out of the way

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.330 
you how fast can you move out of the way
and<00:01:03.719> judge<00:01:03.989> Oh<00:01:04.290> nearly<00:01:07.159> I'm<00:01:08.159> over<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:09.140> Fred

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
and judge Oh nearly I'm over out Fred

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.990 
and judge Oh nearly I'm over out Fred
just<00:01:11.340> bounces<00:01:11.850> basically<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:13.229> has<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.909> of

just bounces basically he has no kind of
other<00:01:15.180> movement<00:01:15.659> other<00:01:15.869> than<00:01:16.430> falling<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
other movement other than falling and a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
other movement other than falling and a
little<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.950> left-right<00:01:19.950> up-down

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
