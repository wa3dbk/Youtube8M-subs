virtually done is we've taken that
bridge<00:01:53.499> rectifier<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.159> I'll<00:01:54.279> open<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:54.639> up

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
bridge rectifier and I'll open this up

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.969 
bridge rectifier and I'll open this up
just<00:01:54.880> I'd<00:01:55.359> left<00:01:55.509> one<00:01:55.810> screw<00:01:56.169> register<00:01:56.619> yeah<00:01:56.740> oh

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
just I'd left one screw register yeah oh

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.830 
just I'd left one screw register yeah oh
it<00:01:57.429> does<00:01:57.609> be<00:01:57.789> taking<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.149> bridge<00:01:58.389> rectifier

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
it does be taking that bridge rectifier

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.399 
it does be taking that bridge rectifier
we<00:01:59.469> put<00:01:59.679> it<00:01:59.770> inside<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.929> die<00:02:01.929> cast<00:02:02.259> aluminum

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
we put it inside this die cast aluminum

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.889 
we put it inside this die cast aluminum
box<00:02:02.859> it<00:02:03.189> has<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> cooling<00:02:03.819> fan<00:02:03.849> in<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.389> keeps<00:02:04.749> it

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
box it has a cooling fan in it keeps it

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.830 
box it has a cooling fan in it keeps it
cool<00:02:05.139> it's<00:02:06.069> got<00:02:06.189> holes<00:02:06.429> in<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.909> let<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.719> air

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
cool it's got holes in it to let the air

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.250 
cool it's got holes in it to let the air
pass<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.500> has<00:02:08.649> wires<00:02:09.610> connected<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.479> what

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
pass and it has wires connected and what

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
pass and it has wires connected and what
we<00:02:11.410> do<00:02:11.560> with<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.910> where<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.300> cannot

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
we do with this is this where you cannot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
we do with this is this where you cannot
fit<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.319> secondary<00:02:14.800> rectifier<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:16.180> the

this<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.400> fit

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
this will fit

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.510 
this will fit
many<00:02:19.450> different<00:02:19.690> imports<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.800> things<00:02:21.400> like

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
many different imports and things like

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
many different imports and things like
that<00:02:21.580> what<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.390> connect<00:02:22.750> these

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that what you do is you connect these

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.770 
that what you do is you connect these
wires<00:02:23.350> into<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> alternator<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.660> an

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
wires into the alternator and this is an

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
wires into the alternator and this is an
ignition<00:02:26.050> wire<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.250> I'll<00:02:27.550> show<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.880> little

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
ignition wire and I'll show you a little

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
ignition wire and I'll show you a little
bit<00:02:28.090> out<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.390> GM<00:02:28.630> alternator

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
bit out of GM alternator

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.940 
bit out of GM alternator
this<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> ad<00:02:31.180> 240<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.290> alternator<00:02:32.770> which

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
this is the ad 240 for alternator which

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670 
this is the ad 240 for alternator which
is<00:02:33.070> common<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.760> many<00:02:34.750> GM<00:02:35.140> vehicles<00:02:35.560> this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
is common on many GM vehicles this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.190 
is common on many GM vehicles this
actually<00:02:36.040> came<00:02:36.250> off<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.790> believe<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> suburban

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
actually came off I believe a suburban

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.030 
actually came off I believe a suburban
and<00:02:39.010> what<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.340> has<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.820> has<00:02:40.020> her<00:02:41.020> your<00:02:41.290> AC<00:02:41.560> lines

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
and what it has it has her your AC lines

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.070 
and what it has it has her your AC lines
that<00:02:42.310> come<00:02:42.460> up<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.880> alternator<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.930> what

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that come up on the alternator and what

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.180 
that come up on the alternator and what
I<00:02:44.110> would<00:02:44.350> do<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.590> we're<00:02:44.740> going<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.890> show<00:02:44.980> this

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
I would do is we're going to show this

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.980 
I would do is we're going to show this
later<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.610> not<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.120> video<00:02:46.300> but<00:02:46.540> later<00:02:46.780> on

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
later on not in this video but later on

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.110 
later on not in this video but later on
how<00:02:47.710> we<00:02:47.770> bring<00:02:48.040> these<00:02:48.190> leads<00:02:48.460> down<00:02:48.730> inside

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
how we bring these leads down inside

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
how we bring these leads down inside
will<00:02:49.240> pop<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.630> cover<00:02:49.900> off<00:02:50.190> exposing<00:02:51.190> that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
will pop this cover off exposing that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.220 
will pop this cover off exposing that
bridge<00:02:51.520> rectifier<00:02:51.940> showing<00:02:52.480> those<00:02:52.630> AC<00:02:52.840> leads

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
bridge rectifier showing those AC leads

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.860 
bridge rectifier showing those AC leads
and<00:02:53.500> then<00:02:54.220> we'll<00:02:54.400> bring<00:02:55.150> these<00:02:55.360> down<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.690> and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and then we'll bring these down in and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.160 
and then we'll bring these down in and
attach<00:02:56.170> them<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.710> once<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.850> attach<00:02:58.170> once

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
attach them to it once you attach once

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.470 
attach them to it once you attach once
you<00:02:59.260> attach<00:02:59.530> those<00:02:59.710> leads<00:03:00.040> now<00:03:00.910> what<00:03:01.090> happens

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
you attach those leads now what happens

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 
you attach those leads now what happens
is<00:03:01.780> how<00:03:02.560> one<00:03:02.740> wants<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.070> follow<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.550> path<00:03:03.760> of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
is how one wants to follow the path of

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.580 
is how one wants to follow the path of
least<00:03:04.000> resistance<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.840> when<00:03:05.080> your<00:03:05.200> alternator

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
least resistance so when your alternator

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.550 
least resistance so when your alternator
generates<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.280> AC<00:03:06.430> power<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:08.020> will<00:03:08.260> come<00:03:08.440> out

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
generates the AC power it will come out

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.320 
generates the AC power it will come out
through<00:03:09.130> these<00:03:09.310> leaves<00:03:09.670> because<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.240> a

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
through these leaves because this is a

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.060 
through these leaves because this is a
much<00:03:10.540> more<00:03:10.840> efficient<00:03:11.350> bridge<00:03:11.530> rectifier

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
much more efficient bridge rectifier

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.610 
much more efficient bridge rectifier
than<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.330> inside<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.690> alternator<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
than the one inside the alternator and

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.900 
than the one inside the alternator and
you<00:03:14.710> have<00:03:14.860> your<00:03:15.010> negative<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.430> positive

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
you have your negative and positive

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.910 
you have your negative and positive
these<00:03:16.000> would<00:03:16.210> be<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.570> like<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.960> negative<00:03:17.860> a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
these would be just like that negative a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.290 
these would be just like that negative a
positive<00:03:18.040> coming<00:03:18.520> up<00:03:18.640> you'd<00:03:18.790> run<00:03:18.970> these<00:03:19.120> right

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
positive coming up you'd run these right

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.940 
positive coming up you'd run these right
to<00:03:19.420> your<00:03:19.510> battery<00:03:19.720> what'll<00:03:20.530> happen<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
to your battery what'll happen is the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.140 
to your battery what'll happen is the
power<00:03:21.100> will<00:03:21.280> come<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.700> your<00:03:21.820> alternator

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
power will come out of your alternator

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.720 
power will come out of your alternator
up<00:03:22.750> into<00:03:23.140> these<00:03:23.260> lines<00:03:23.560> then<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.280> power<00:03:24.520> your

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
up into these lines then you power your

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.210 
up into these lines then you power your
stereo<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.210> whatever<00:03:25.390> else<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.780> need<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:27.040> it

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
stereo and whatever else you need and it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.850 
stereo and whatever else you need and it
takes<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.640> load<00:03:27.880> off<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:29.020> rectifier<00:03:29.500> inside

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
takes the load off the rectifier inside

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.770 
takes the load off the rectifier inside
the<00:03:30.010> alternator<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.910> make<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> last<00:03:31.450> much

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the alternator will make a last much

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.810 
the alternator will make a last much
longer
