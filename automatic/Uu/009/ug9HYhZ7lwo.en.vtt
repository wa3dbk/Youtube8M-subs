00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
probably related to hip impingement so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
probably related to hip impingement so
it's<00:02:07.890> an<00:02:08.009> important<00:02:08.429> diagnosis<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's an important diagnosis for all of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.050 
it's an important diagnosis for all of
us<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> understand

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
us to understand

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.000 
us to understand
now<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> type<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.420> patients<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.200> usually

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
now the type of patients that I usually

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.980 
now the type of patients that I usually
see<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.670> type<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> problem<00:02:15.240> frequently

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
see with this type of problem frequently

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.490 
see with this type of problem frequently
present<00:02:16.410> under<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> age<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.459> 50<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.500> their

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
present under the age of 50 and their

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.430 
present under the age of 50 and their
pain<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.280> localized<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.660> into<00:02:21.959> their<00:02:22.110> grind

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
pain is localized right into their grind

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
pain is localized right into their grind
and<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:23.280> particularly<00:02:23.700> describe<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.480> pain

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and they particularly describe the pain

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.590 
and they particularly describe the pain
as<00:02:24.840> being<00:02:25.050> worse<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.620> exertion<00:02:26.600> they

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
as being worse with exertion they

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.930 
as being worse with exertion they
frequently<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.709> loss<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.310> motion<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
frequently have loss of motion and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.150 
frequently have loss of motion and
particularly<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.170> hip<00:02:31.470> flexion<00:02:31.800> or<00:02:31.980> bending

particularly in hip flexion or bending

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.699 
particularly in hip flexion or bending
of<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.880> hip<00:02:33.150> trying<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.959> bring<00:02:34.110> their<00:02:34.260> knee<00:02:34.440> up

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
of the hip trying to bring their knee up

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.910 
of the hip trying to bring their knee up
to<00:02:34.950> their<00:02:35.160> chest<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.209> speak<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:37.739> is

to their chest so to speak and this is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.979 
to their chest so to speak and this is
either<00:02:38.220> due<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.970> fact<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.540> they<00:02:39.780> are

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
either due to the fact that they are

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.260 
either due to the fact that they are
very<00:02:40.200> painful<00:02:40.560> doing<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.640> maneuver<00:02:42.120> because

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
very painful doing this maneuver because

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.790 
very painful doing this maneuver because
of<00:02:42.630> torn<00:02:42.840> structures<00:02:43.350> which<00:02:43.500> we'll<00:02:43.680> talk

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
of torn structures which we'll talk

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.400 
of torn structures which we'll talk
about<00:02:43.860> or<00:02:44.580> their<00:02:45.180> structural<00:02:45.630> abnormalities

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
about or their structural abnormalities

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.410 
about or their structural abnormalities
just<00:02:46.680> will<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.040> allow<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:48.270> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
just will not allow it because of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.090 
just will not allow it because of
impingement<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.410> ball<00:02:49.590> against<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
impingement of the ball against the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.030 
impingement of the ball against the
socket<00:02:51.080> now<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> very<00:02:52.739> subtle

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
socket now this is a very subtle

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.850 
socket now this is a very subtle
diagnosis<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.150> that's<00:02:54.870> probably<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
diagnosis and that's probably one of the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.800 
diagnosis and that's probably one of the
reasons<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.550> hidden<00:02:56.760> diagnosis<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.660> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
reasons it's the hidden diagnosis for so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.560 
reasons it's the hidden diagnosis for so
many<00:02:57.989> years<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.280> are<00:02:59.570> significant

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
many years but there are significant

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that help us understand it but just to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.979 
that help us understand it but just to
show<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.280> how<00:03:05.610> difficult<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.209> diagnosis<00:03:06.810> can

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
show you how difficult the diagnosis can

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.680 
show you how difficult the diagnosis can
be<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.950> there's<00:03:08.190> frequently<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.060> average

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.509 
be that there's frequently on average
about<00:03:09.930> five<00:03:10.350> years<00:03:10.860> from<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.310> time<00:03:11.489> of

symptoms to the time of diagnosis and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.620 
symptoms to the time of diagnosis and
many<00:03:14.100> times<00:03:14.370> patients<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.180> more<00:03:15.450> than

one doctor before the diagnosis is made

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.900 
one doctor before the diagnosis is made

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and sometimes by the time the diagnosis

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.190 
and sometimes by the time the diagnosis
is<00:03:21.060> made<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.480> progression<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.170> disease

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
is made the progression of the disease

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.580 
is made the progression of the disease
process<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:23.160> beyond<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.810> taken

care of with a non Arthur plastic
options<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:30.380> first<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.530> all<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.890> understand

options so first of all to understand
this<00:03:32.549> better<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.120> think<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.510> helpful<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.170> show

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
this better I think it's helpful to show

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.160 
this better I think it's helpful to show
what<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.549> consider<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> normal<00:03:36.540> functional

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
anatomy of the hip you can see that the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
head which is what we're going to talk

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.260 
head which is what we're going to talk
about<00:04:51.530> today<00:04:51.830> which<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.160> basically<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.910> head

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
about today which is basically a head

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.410 
about today which is basically a head
which<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:53.990> too<00:04:54.200> big<00:04:54.500> or<00:04:54.880> oval<00:04:55.880> shaped<00:04:56.180> and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
which is just too big or oval shaped and

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.360 
which is just too big or oval shaped and
so<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.630> won't<00:04:56.870> actually<00:04:57.110> rotate<00:04:57.800> into<00:04:58.010> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
so it won't actually rotate into a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.600 
so it won't actually rotate into a
spherical<00:04:59.210> socket<00:04:59.840> or<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.830> socket<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:01.460> have

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
spherical socket or the socket can have

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.600 
spherical socket or the socket can have
too<00:05:01.820> much<00:05:01.970> over<00:05:02.420> coverage<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.100> sometimes<00:05:04.100> it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
too much over coverage and sometimes it

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.450 
too much over coverage and sometimes it
can<00:05:04.910> actually<00:05:05.180> result<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.230> even<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:07.100> normal

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
can actually result in even a normal

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.700 
can actually result in even a normal
head<00:05:07.670> and<00:05:07.850> pinching<00:05:08.240> on<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.480> socket<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.110> then

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
head and pinching on the socket and then

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.040 
head and pinching on the socket and then
as<00:05:09.890> I<00:05:09.920> talked<00:05:10.280> about<00:05:10.400> previously<00:05:10.870> too<00:05:11.870> much

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
as I talked about previously too much

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.050 
as I talked about previously too much
laxity<00:05:12.710> allowing<00:05:13.100> too<00:05:13.250> much<00:05:13.430> movement<00:05:13.700> can

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
laxity allowing too much movement can

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.790 
laxity allowing too much movement can
even<00:05:14.330> cause<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.570> normal<00:05:15.170> hip<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.980> impinge<00:05:16.690> and

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
even cause a normal hip to impinge and

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.860 
even cause a normal hip to impinge and
all<00:05:18.800> these<00:05:19.010> three<00:05:19.430> just<00:05:19.730> different<00:05:20.240> ways<00:05:20.540> of

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
all these three just different ways of

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.110 
all these three just different ways of
cause<00:05:21.200> new<00:05:21.440> pigment<00:05:21.680> can<00:05:22.130> result<00:05:22.580> in<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
cause new pigment can result in the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.600 
cause new pigment can result in the
labrum<00:05:23.540> becoming<00:05:23.960> torn<00:05:24.350> and<00:05:24.620> when<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.430> labrum

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
labrum becoming torn and when the labrum

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.210 
labrum becoming torn and when the labrum
Storn<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.270> become<00:05:26.600> can<00:05:27.200> become<00:05:27.530> painful<00:05:27.710> and

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
Storn it become can become painful and

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.580 
Storn it become can become painful and
lessen<00:05:29.060> lubrication<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:29.990> potentially

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
lessen lubrication and potentially

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.130 
lessen lubrication and potentially
result<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.520> arthritic<00:05:31.850> symptoms<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.690> because

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
result in arthritic symptoms and because

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.430 
result in arthritic symptoms and because
of<00:05:33.170> increased<00:05:33.800> friction<00:05:34.010> of<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.310> hip<00:05:35.440> I've

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
of increased friction of the hip I've

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.830 
of increased friction of the hip I've
tried<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:37.070> show<00:05:37.100> what<00:05:37.760> this<00:05:37.940> is<00:05:38.150> basically

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
tried to show what this is basically

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.560 
tried to show what this is basically
like<00:05:38.960> by<00:05:39.590> taking<00:05:40.220> an<00:05:40.310> MRI<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:41.060> actually

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
like by taking an MRI and actually

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.870 
like by taking an MRI and actually
overlay<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.140> an<00:05:42.260> egg<00:05:42.440> shape<00:05:42.710> to<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:42.980> which

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
overlay in an egg shape to it which

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.540 
overlay in an egg shape to it which
would<00:05:44.420> simulate<00:05:45.050> what<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.590> head<00:05:46.190> would<00:05:46.400> be

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
would simulate what the head would be

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.130 
would simulate what the head would be
like<00:05:46.760> now<00:05:47.030> if<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.240> can<00:05:47.420> imagine<00:05:47.630> this<00:05:47.930> head

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
like now if you can imagine this head

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.250 
like now if you can imagine this head
going<00:05:48.470> up<00:05:48.590> into<00:05:48.890> flexion<00:05:49.540> it<00:05:50.540> would<00:05:50.750> first<00:05:51.050> of

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
going up into flexion it would first of

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.960 
going up into flexion it would first of
all<00:05:51.410> start<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.830> push<00:05:52.040> as<00:05:52.250> dr.<00:05:52.580> Kenny<00:05:52.790> will

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
what we call MRI arthrography which is

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.749 
what we call MRI arthrography which is
basically<00:07:16.849> an<00:07:17.180> MRI<00:07:17.690> after<00:07:18.250> the<00:07:19.250> hip<00:07:19.460> has<00:07:19.550> been

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
basically an MRI after the hip has been

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.610 
basically an MRI after the hip has been
injected<00:07:20.060> with<00:07:20.270> a<00:07:20.419> fluid<00:07:20.870> that's<00:07:21.080> a<00:07:21.169> special

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
injected with a fluid that's a special

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.830 
injected with a fluid that's a special
dye<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:22.070> you<00:07:22.130> can<00:07:22.340> see<00:07:22.550> on<00:07:22.699> MRI<00:07:23.120> which

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
dye that you can see on MRI which

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.010 
dye that you can see on MRI which
outlines<00:07:24.349> the<00:07:24.560> labrum<00:07:24.979> nicely<00:07:25.539> and<00:07:26.539> also<00:07:26.900> at

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
outlines the labrum nicely and also at

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.870 
outlines the labrum nicely and also at
the<00:07:27.139> same<00:07:27.349> time<00:07:27.590> we<00:07:27.740> inject<00:07:28.070> local<00:07:28.220> anesthetic

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
the same time we inject local anesthetic

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.850 
the same time we inject local anesthetic
in<00:07:29.030> the<00:07:29.120> same<00:07:29.330> syringe<00:07:29.750> and<00:07:30.080> that<00:07:30.680> can

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
in the same syringe and that can

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.770 
in the same syringe and that can
actually<00:07:31.070> be<00:07:31.310> very<00:07:31.669> helpful<00:07:32.060> because<00:07:32.330> then<00:07:32.659> we

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780 
actually be very helpful because then we

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.499 
actually be very helpful because then we
can<00:07:32.990> eliminate<00:07:33.470> any<00:07:34.190> pain<00:07:34.550> for<00:07:34.820> even<00:07:35.150> a<00:07:35.240> short

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:35.509 
can eliminate any pain for even a short

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.540 
can eliminate any pain for even a short
period<00:07:35.840> with<00:07:36.110> the<00:07:36.139> duration<00:07:36.830> of<00:07:37.069> the<00:07:37.220> local

period with the duration of the local
anesthetic<00:07:37.759> and<00:07:38.440> that<00:07:39.440> will<00:07:39.650> hurt<00:07:39.800> us<00:07:40.039> that

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
anesthetic and that will hurt us that

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.950 
anesthetic and that will hurt us that

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
whatever pain is being relieved is

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.320 
whatever pain is being relieved is
coming<00:07:42.259> from<00:07:42.409> inside<00:07:42.770> the<00:07:43.340> hip<00:07:43.520> capsule<00:07:44.030> and
