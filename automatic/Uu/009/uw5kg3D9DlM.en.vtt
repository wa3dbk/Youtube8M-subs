00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
all right today we're looking at the HD

radeon 4350 from XFX very cool very

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.460 
radeon 4350 from XFX very cool very
small<00:00:17.150> little<00:00:17.330> low-profile<00:00:17.869> graphics<00:00:18.290> card

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
small little low-profile graphics card

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.530 
small little low-profile graphics card
it<00:00:18.950> doesn't<00:00:19.189> take<00:00:19.279> too<00:00:19.369> much<00:00:19.430> power<00:00:19.730> can<00:00:20.150> we

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
it doesn't take too much power can we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.960 
it doesn't take too much power can we
run<00:00:20.689> on<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.840> 300-watt<00:00:21.260> power<00:00:21.500> supply<00:00:21.830> and<00:00:22.160> it

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
run on a 300-watt power supply and it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.100 
run on a 300-watt power supply and it
works<00:00:23.150> on<00:00:23.270> two<00:00:23.420> types<00:00:23.600> of<00:00:23.660> computers<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.080> can

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
works on two types of computers you can

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.300 
works on two types of computers you can
either<00:00:24.290> use<00:00:24.410> it<00:00:24.500> on<00:00:24.619> your<00:00:24.920> regular<00:00:25.220> computer

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
either use it on your regular computer

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.430 
either use it on your regular computer
just<00:00:25.700> like<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.030> or<00:00:26.240> if<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.170> have<00:00:27.260> a<00:00:27.320> little

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
just like this or if you have a little

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.600 
just like this or if you have a little
tiny<00:00:27.680> computer<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.130> just<00:00:28.190> need<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.369> little<00:00:28.520> bit

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
tiny computer you just need a little bit

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.910 
tiny computer you just need a little bit
of<00:00:28.699> GPU<00:00:29.030> power<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:29.990> comes<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.289> low<00:00:30.440> profile

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
of GPU power it comes with a low profile

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.070 
of GPU power it comes with a low profile
bracket<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:31.640> that's<00:00:31.789> pretty<00:00:32.150> cool<00:00:32.390> so

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
bracket so that's pretty cool so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.360 
bracket so that's pretty cool so
basically<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.680> people<00:00:34.010> who<00:00:34.129> are<00:00:34.190> gonna<00:00:34.280> be

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
wanting to buy a card like this are

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.660 
wanting to buy a card like this are
somebody<00:00:36.080> or<00:00:36.739> people<00:00:37.010> basically<00:00:37.250> they<00:00:37.460> just

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
somebody or people basically they just

they want to do maybe some really really
light<00:00:42.769> gaming<00:00:43.010> like<00:00:43.250> half-life<00:00:43.580> 2<00:00:43.760> engine

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
light gaming like half-life 2 engine

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.119 
light gaming like half-life 2 engine
stuff<00:00:44.269> or<00:00:44.510> some<00:00:45.110> world<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.409> warcraft<00:00:45.860> stuff

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
stuff or some world of warcraft stuff

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.880 
stuff or some world of warcraft stuff
like<00:00:46.280> that<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.059> will<00:00:47.360> do<00:00:47.659> though<00:00:47.960> any<00:00:48.589> type<00:00:48.860> of

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
like that it will do though any type of

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.350 
like that it will do though any type of
HD<00:00:49.190> video<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.519> throw<00:00:49.699> at<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.879> including

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
HD video you can throw at it including

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.960 
HD video you can throw at it including
multiple<00:00:50.920> occurrences<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.250> HD<00:00:52.699> video<00:00:52.790> you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
multiple occurrences of HD video you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.860 
multiple occurrences of HD video you
could<00:00:53.059> probably<00:00:53.180> run<00:00:53.420> two<00:00:53.600> different

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
could probably run two different

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.869 
could probably run two different
instances<00:00:54.049> of<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:54.979> blu-ray<00:00:55.190> playing<00:00:55.610> with

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
instances of a blu-ray playing with

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.070 
instances of a blu-ray playing with
multi-channel<00:00:56.210> audio<00:00:56.479> and<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.870> will<00:00:57.049> throw

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
multi-channel audio and it will throw

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.590 
multi-channel audio and it will throw
them<00:00:57.409> out<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.650> that<00:00:57.710> uses<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.250> ati<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.269> vivo

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
them out and that uses the ati of vivo

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.750 
them out and that uses the ati of vivo
technology<00:01:00.229> to<00:01:00.379> do<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:01.430> can<00:01:01.580> basically

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
technology to do that you can basically

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.000 
technology to do that you can basically
probably<00:01:02.180> power<00:01:02.479> even<00:01:03.350> more<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.830> maybe

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
probably power even more it's it maybe

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.800 
probably power even more it's it maybe
it's<00:01:04.159> like<00:01:04.309> three<00:01:04.670> HD<00:01:05.089> sources<00:01:05.239> at<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.600> same

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's like three HD sources at the same

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.690 
it's like three HD sources at the same
time<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.680> wouldn't<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:07.010> any<00:01:07.250> problems

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
time and it wouldn't have any problems

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.640 
time and it wouldn't have any problems
as<00:01:07.820> far<00:01:07.850> as<00:01:08.000> gaming<00:01:08.240> goes<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:08.869> pretty<00:01:08.930> good<00:01:09.409> i

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
as far as gaming goes it's pretty good i

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.080 
as far as gaming goes it's pretty good i
wouldn't<00:01:10.100> use<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.220> on<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.400> high<00:01:10.610> resolution

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
wouldn't use it on a high resolution

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.760 
wouldn't use it on a high resolution
display<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:11.869> definitely<00:01:12.290> not<00:01:12.380> gonna<00:01:12.560> play

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
display it's definitely not gonna play
