also makes them come alive
maybe<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.160> why<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> younger

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
maybe that's why there was a younger

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
maybe that's why there was a younger
more<00:00:24.539> accessible<00:00:25.260> spirit<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> collection

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that repelling show if maybe think of a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.630 
that repelling show if maybe think of a
wild<00:00:33.210> mountain<00:00:33.710> scenario<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:34.980> those

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
wild mountain scenario you know those

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
wild mountain scenario you know those
shoes<00:00:35.969> before<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.320> fact<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.800> all

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
shoes before the fact that we were all

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
shoes before the fact that we were all
rapping<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.640> no<00:00:38.850> buttons<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:39.870> closure<00:00:40.140> or

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
rapping with no buttons or closure or

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
rapping with no buttons or closure or
something<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.309> hide<00:00:41.579> yourself<00:00:42.030> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
something that you can hide yourself in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.350 
something that you can hide yourself in
like<00:00:43.050> extreme<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
like extreme for me I think for me it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.990 
like extreme for me I think for me it
was<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> bit<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.829> return<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.430> form<00:00:47.730> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
Rick
last<00:00:49.020> season<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.340> more

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
last season I think there are more

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.939 
last season I think there are more
experimentation<00:00:51.329> maybe<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
experimentation maybe and I think this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.189 
experimentation maybe and I think this
was<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.219> more<00:00:53.879> hardcore<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
was just more hardcore which is what I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.700 
was just more hardcore which is what I
love<00:00:55.469> about<00:00:55.620> regular<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.930> think<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.199> him<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
love about regular I think with him it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
love about regular I think with him it's
always<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> continuation

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
always a continuation

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.779 
always a continuation
he<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.930> always<00:01:01.170> surprising<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
he is always surprising you but it's the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
he is always surprising you but it's the
same<00:01:03.030> signature

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
same signature

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.859 
same signature
Sam<00:01:04.559> looks<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.280> classic<00:01:05.820> Craig<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.550 

it's<00:01:39.189> really<00:01:39.399> powerful<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.390> sexy<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:41.439> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
it's really powerful and sexy in a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.410 
it's really powerful and sexy in a
strange<00:01:41.890> way<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.399> think<00:01:42.609> that<00:01:42.880> might<00:01:43.030> be<00:01:43.060> part

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
strange way I think that might be part

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.080 
strange way I think that might be part
of<00:01:43.509> moving<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.960> France<00:01:44.200> my<00:01:44.799> gimmick<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.640> an

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
of moving to France my gimmick is an

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.859 
of moving to France my gimmick is an
American's<00:01:46.840> brutish<00:01:47.710> or<00:01:48.219> crude

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
American's brutish or crude

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.480 
American's brutish or crude
interpretation<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:50.110> European<00:01:50.619> complexity

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
interpretation of European complexity

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.340 
interpretation of European complexity
and<00:01:51.819> everything<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.539> do<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.990> kind<00:01:53.200> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
and everything that I do is kind of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.609 
and everything that I do is kind of
almost<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.859> cartoonish<00:01:54.640> homage<00:01:55.329> in<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.170> way<00:01:56.350> I

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
almost a cartoonish homage in a way I

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.109 
almost a cartoonish homage in a way I
think<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.100> really<00:01:57.399> kind<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.700> explains

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
think that really kind of explains

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.840 
think that really kind of explains
everything<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.780> do
