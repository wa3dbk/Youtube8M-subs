00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
I put the link in a sidebar or somewhere

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
I put the link in a sidebar or somewhere
around<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.740> but<00:02:27.740> yeah<00:02:28.490> for<00:02:29.240> 20<00:02:29.540> bucks<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
around here but yeah for 20 bucks I
