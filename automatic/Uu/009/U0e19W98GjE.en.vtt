00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
good block defense and we get a little

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.379 
good block defense and we get a little
bit<00:00:07.680> more<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:08.160> offensively<00:00:08.880> than<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.210> have

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
bit more out offensively than we have

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.730 
bit more out offensively than we have
over<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> last<00:00:09.719> couple<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> games<00:00:10.200> being<00:00:10.590> on

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
over the last couple of games being on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.820 
over the last couple of games being on
the<00:00:10.800> road<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> way<00:00:13.620> our

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
the road I think I like the way our

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:35.229 
the road I think I like the way our
chances<00:00:14.280> on

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.369 

there's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> hard<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:36.840> they

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
there's going to be a hard game they

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.290 
there's going to be a hard game they
also<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> table<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.910> us<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
also at the top of the table with us I

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.549 
also at the top of the table with us I
suppose<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> points<00:00:40.199> it's<00:00:40.320> really

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
suppose for the points it's really

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740 
suppose for the points it's really
important<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.239> overall<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.600> they're

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
important but overall there they're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.939 
important but overall there they're
going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> come<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.320> play<00:00:43.410> some<00:00:43.500> nice

football and we'll see whether we can
come<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.269> on<00:00:51.510> top<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.900> bigger<00:00:52.230> extra<00:00:52.500> bit

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
important for us to win like we we add

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.399 
important for us to win like we we add
to<00:00:59.610> win<00:00:59.879> in<00:00:59.970> Columbus<00:01:00.360> we<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.809> win<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.050> DC

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
to win in Columbus we had to win in DC

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.590 
to win in Columbus we had to win in DC
we<00:01:01.979> had<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.430> dead<00:01:02.670> New<00:01:02.909> England<00:01:02.970> now<00:01:03.540> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we had to be dead New England now we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.740

have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.140> beat<00:01:04.339> Montreal<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
have to beat Montreal so we all know it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.910 
have to beat Montreal so we all know it
won't<00:01:06.899> be<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.110> easy<00:01:07.170> game<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.770> don't

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
won't be an easy game because they don't

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
won't be an easy game because they don't
consider<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.450> eat

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
consider lot and you know they can eat

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.090 
consider lot and you know they can eat
you<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.960> any<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.560> break<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.920> G

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you at any time on the break with G

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
you at any time on the break with G
value<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.929> we<00:01:13.020> won't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
value so you know we won't have to to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
value so you know we won't have to to
perform<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.300> said<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.539> don't<00:01:16.200> don't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
perform and like I said I don't don't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.109 
perform and like I said I don't don't
take<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> wrong<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.160> it<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> great<00:01:17.850> win

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
take it the wrong way it was a great win

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
take it the wrong way it was a great win
in<00:01:18.270> Columbus<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:18.929> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.470> did

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
in Columbus but I don't think we did

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.139 
in Columbus but I don't think we did
deserve<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> win<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> bit

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
deserve to win and if you want a bit

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.249 
deserve to win and if you want a bit
much<00:01:21.300> well<00:01:21.539> you<00:01:21.690> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> play<00:01:22.020> better<00:01:22.140> than

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
much well you have to play better than

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.499 
much well you have to play better than
what<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.619> did<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.830> columns<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.910> LT<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.330> any

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
what we did in columns and LT is any

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.270 
what we did in columns and LT is any
secrets<00:01:24.929> about<00:01:25.110> continuing<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> work<00:01:26.100> at

secrets about continuing to work at
things<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.850> drilling<00:01:27.720> things<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.140> players

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
things about drilling things and players

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.200 
things about drilling things and players
minds<00:01:28.679> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.190> defenders<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> that's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
minds of the defenders first and that's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.460 
minds of the defenders first and that's
all<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.600> expecting<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.320> anything

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
all I'm expecting them to do anything

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
all I'm expecting them to do anything
they<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.039> with<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.280> ball<00:01:32.460> offensively

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
they could do with the ball offensively

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
they could do with the ball offensively
it's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.690> bonus<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.080> us<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.069> end<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's a bonus for us at the end of the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's a bonus for us at the end of the
day<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.819> hit<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> ball<00:01:36.179> out<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
day they have to hit the ball out of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.669 
day they have to hit the ball out of the
net<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> competition<00:01:37.560> that's

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
net and I think the competition that's

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:38.810 
net and I think the competition that's
been<00:01:37.860> created<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.310> certain<00:01:38.579> players

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
been created with certain players

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.210 
been created with certain players
because<00:01:39.329> maybe<00:01:39.509> motivated<00:01:40.110> players<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
because maybe motivated players to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
because maybe motivated players to
perform<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.820> stay<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> field<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
perform and stay on the field and I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
perform and stay on the field and I
think<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.310> far<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> finished

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
think that it is far from a finished

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
think that it is far from a finished
product<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.540> far<00:01:45.720> from<00:01:45.840> saying<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> we're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
product it's far from saying that we're

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
product it's far from saying that we're
going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.310> give<00:01:47.490> any<00:01:47.640> more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
going to you know not give any more

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.560 
going to you know not give any more
goals<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> long<00:01:49.020> season<00:01:49.200> ahead

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
goals up you know as a long season ahead

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.700 
goals up you know as a long season ahead
confidence<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.259> only<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.590> good

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
confidence is good but it's only as good

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
confidence is good but it's only as good
as<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.890> last<00:01:53.009> game<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.000> us<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.420> all

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
about not being complacent and basically

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.090 
about not being complacent and basically
