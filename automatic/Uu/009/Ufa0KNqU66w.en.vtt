00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.080
 in Israel love cooking eggplants 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.430
 of which all kinds of dishes can be bought and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.309
 different prepared dishes an eggplant salad 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.730
 today I'll show you how to cook 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 babaganush 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.160
 or rich babaganush differently called 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 here is babaganush 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.470
 it is popular in the whole middle east 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.400
 eggplant dishes the main thing is that the recipe 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 very simple i am taking 2 eggplants and now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.160
 I'll show you what I will do first 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.200
 all need to bake the eggplant can be 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 sure do it right on the gas 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 the burner but then you have to keep them 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 turn them over and this work of course 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 can be baked on charcoal 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 but not always you have a burning house 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 coals so the simplest is just 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 bake them in the oven to bake them 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 need to pierce them in several places 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.899
 which I did pierced as it should 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.399
 with a fork you can see it because they 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 can flow when they become 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 soft 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.130
 Well, in case of C, all the same and not flow 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.999
 or burst I put the foil on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 baking tray 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:14.549
 the oven I will be in preheated to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.590
 pretty strong heat the oven is wrong 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.630
 essentially to what heat just if 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.099
 there will be more heat so they go down 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.779
 faster i do somewhere 220 degrees and not 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.119
 not less than 40 minutes to pike 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:29.939
 they must become really very 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.039
 very soft and so i 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.439
 pike eggplants here are eggplants baked 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.249
 until complete softness here I cut them 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.249
 uncovered 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:45.840
 and now just a spoon I'll be a violinist 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:46.979
 here and so the contents of the eggplant after 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.169
 of us 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.259
 I scrubbed the eggplant I stabbed it on 

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:57.599
 chalkboard like this 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.569
 no need to grind it until smooth 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.250
 the masses just grind it is very soft 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.200
 very easy and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.679
 eggs that's what I got from two 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 small eggplant that's such a mass 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.990
 now I have to salt it and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.370
 pepper squeeze 1 clove of garlic here 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.170
 for this amount you need and half a lemon 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.910
 squeeze the juice to me very much and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.040
 there put one tablespoon 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.740
 khe-khe on this is such a paste of sesame 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.620
 which is sold in finished form in all 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.080
 I don't have any stores right now so I 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.270
 I'll put a tablespoon of mayonnaise very 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.850
 excellent and with mayonnaise though 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.310
 the original recipe requires exactly 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.100
 tekhinoy but what if i and u 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.500

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.050
 link to the video where I show products 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.310
 which I bought in the supermarket there I 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:03.780
 showing and sesame paste that is and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.959
 Well, the salad in finished form 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.570
 how to eat him eat him very simply or 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.080
 take a piece of pit and and pick this 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.250
 feed 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.530
 and I'm just like hummus or can 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.840
 just put some bread on top 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.420
 can be salty bite or a cucumber 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.709
 tomato sprinkle dill turns 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.209
 delicious sandwich 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.640
 you can eat with a spoon by the way, you can add 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.870
 In this and Baba Ganush, you can add more 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.900
 chopped parsley 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.299
 it's all a matter of taste salt if you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.480
 put mayonnaise advise caution because 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.690
 that mayonnaise itself contains salt by the way here 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 this salad option with mayonnaise can 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.150
 Buy and sell at the supermarket 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 we are called xc limbo mayo 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.829
 that is, eggplants in mayonnaise but what 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.720
 not different from home so that there 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.090
 have preservatives so you can 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.070
 keep longer i prefer everything 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.070
 fresh that's all
