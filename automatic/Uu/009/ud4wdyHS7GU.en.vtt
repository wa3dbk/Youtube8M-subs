00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.019
 merge with you vladimir me today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.039
 fell into the hands of two such devices to 1 this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.580
 Sidir engine 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 2 is a flop from normal flop to 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.460
 I have already disassembled the plug 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 what is convenient i was able to connect to the horde of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 windings 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 we have here 3 needs hanks on the engine 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 from pskov to we can not connect 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 because you need to make out about him there 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.300
 below well we just under appeared 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 connection type turns out we have a star 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.110
 here and we will try to simulate whether 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.280
 they work and from the usual 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 transformer here we will have 50 hertz 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 now show here we have enabled 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:07.510
 transformer translate cola frequency 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:11.890
 kilohertz 50 hertz 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 so for 5 to do it will be 50 hertz here 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 perhaps likely start with conventional 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 will scatter to often glue them in 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.670
 was seen 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.230
 so try to connect it as usual 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.360
 engine as usual of these chronicles here 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.500
 we connect the voltage here we connect 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.600
 between any capacitor to wind 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.830
 laboratory engine 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 rather wind the transformer for 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.760
 laboratory conditions that get three 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.080
 goats with a shift of 120 degrees i'm somehow not 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.060
 I decide so look here with us 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.570
 It turns out three conclusions 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.610
 to one connected two capacitor 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 the rest 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:14.040
 one immediately romance under the nut here's the second 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.070
 connect and connect via 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.760
 capacitor 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.760
 also noise was visible 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.170
 works 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.459
 it works but the engine is natural 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 It is heated as it is not designed for 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.549
 alternating current it is rated only 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.879
 on constant voltage to pulsating 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.019
 current 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:49.269
 but still works so let's 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.430
 let's conduct the second experiment with the engine 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.579
 from hdd 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 as the very first test 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:03.629
 let's spend the form of a star we twist all 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.940
 provodochki fasten together here 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.660
 the capacitor finally am probably this 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.099
 very much but for lab purpose yet 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.099
 I repeat it does not matter 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.380
 also works this star now 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.380
 put it in a triangle a triangle 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.910
 Remember that the output is the input the input is the output 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.700
 I have an entrance here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.480
 organized by one twisted wire this 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.680
 output and other twisted wire inputs 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.680
 winding natural colors. 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:05.719
 but the triangle has already started itself 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:08.499
 see it works let's see another 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.499
 recall 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:27.630
 those running works the same as the self 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.940
 The usual asynchronous motor is 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.120
 difficulties with running a practical 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.740
 applications are unlikely to be much pure 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.370
 for laboratory experiments possible 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.820
 and the third way I met on the internet 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.300
 on the internet when we have two 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.050
 boats will be shooting now when we have 2 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.850
 in a hank 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.950
 At the meeting it is connected purely for 220 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.660
 motor from riga winding set 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.580
 the direction is connected if in this form 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.129
 it will work well maybe in 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:12.840
 already full-blown video will also be 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:16.090
 work looks now show 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.409
 showed her already screw two 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.009
 winding connect to each other 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:30.969
 one winding will be seen 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:33.539
 starting through the capacitor we'll see 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:39.280
 will it work like that 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:42.069
 Again connect the capacitor 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.770
 I repeat this is a pure experiment not 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.300
 having so far practical to apply 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.900
 but I do not know the selection practically 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.900
 apply it 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.220
 works 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.740
 and it runs almost 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:13.639
 as much as possible without any help 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:16.870
 so it is a working working 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.870
 I canâ€™t tell the scheme 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.050
 heart engines will heat up and so 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.700
 let's sum up 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.370
 Actually it turns out these here 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.500
 motor stepper motors work 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.500
 can work like aspen chronicles so y 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.440
 these phase shift at 120 degrees has three 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.510
 winding if you arrange them right 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.810
 food maybe they even warm not 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.600
 will but again here 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.980
 everything is regulated by the frequency of turnover 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.560
 frequency controlled 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.320
 not energized and practical yet 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.000
 I do not find an application because 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.330
 using ac we 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.960
 we get there probably 20 percent 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.620
 efficiency 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.169
 the best case or even less so 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.450
 purely as an experiment can be done 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:06.710
 rather I have made can be shown 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:09.560
 you can also try someone 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.780
 simulate any other conditions 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.870
 how here let's say this connection 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.790
 as I showed the middle of the video two 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.060
 winding towards each other and 1 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.460
 220 start winding 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.430
 volt to raise the efficiency to the captain on 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:29.240
 the look should rise just the engine 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.280
 started to start a lot better i hope 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.690
 my video was interesting thanks to all 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.070
 for your attention and all the good experiments 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.070
 bye everyone
