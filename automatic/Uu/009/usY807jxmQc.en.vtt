00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
right path thing you're doing things

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.009 
right path thing you're doing things
that<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.850> shouldn't<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.300> doing<00:03:19.600> just<00:03:19.630> because

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
that you shouldn't be doing just because

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.600 
that you shouldn't be doing just because

you want to get around quickly you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.430 
you want to get around quickly you
really<00:03:22.000> should<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.450> very<00:03:22.780> careful<00:03:23.050> when<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
really should be very careful when you

really should be very careful when you
move<00:03:23.590> around<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.830> map<00:03:23.920> especially<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:24.550> you

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
move around the map especially when you

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.580 
move around the map especially when you
build<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:24.970> into<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> air<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.480> move<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.290> got<00:03:26.470> to

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
build up into the air to move you got to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.920 
build up into the air to move you got to
make<00:03:26.739> sure<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:27.580> you're<00:03:27.610> doing<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> right

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
make sure that you're doing it the right

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.780 
make sure that you're doing it the right
way<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:29.800> someone<00:03:29.980> hits<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.310> don't<00:03:30.610> fall

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
way so if someone hits you don't fall

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.850 
way so if someone hits you don't fall
off<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.150> take<00:03:31.330> damage<00:03:31.569> always<00:03:32.500> move<00:03:32.709> around

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
off and take damage always move around

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.470 
off and take damage always move around
the<00:03:32.950> map<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.370> most<00:03:33.610> secure<00:03:33.880> way<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.150> can

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
the map in the most secure way you can

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.870 
the map in the most secure way you can
and<00:03:34.720> put<00:03:35.350> back<00:03:35.620> drops<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.280> if<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.459> get<00:03:36.610> hit<00:03:36.760> you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and put back drops so if you get hit you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.050 
and put back drops so if you get hit you
just<00:03:36.910> fall<00:03:37.239> back<00:03:37.420> into<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.959> keep<00:03:38.140> going

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
just fall back into it you keep going

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.720 
just fall back into it you keep going
number<00:03:40.060> four<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.380> put<00:03:41.380> water<00:03:41.739> down<00:03:42.070> if<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
number four is put water down if you

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.000 
number four is put water down if you
build<00:03:42.970> high<00:03:43.209> up<00:03:43.329> in<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.510> air<00:03:43.600> put<00:03:44.290> water<00:03:44.709> down

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
build high up in the air put water down

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.100 
build high up in the air put water down
if<00:03:45.280> you're<00:03:45.519> moving<00:03:45.850> across<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.299> map<00:03:46.510> put

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
if you're moving across the map put

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.110 
if you're moving across the map put
water<00:03:47.440> down<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:48.100> should<00:03:48.160> always<00:03:48.489> put<00:03:48.880> water

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
water down you should always put water

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120 
water down you should always put water
down<00:03:49.360> because<00:03:49.660> if<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.959> fall<00:03:50.230> off<00:03:50.530> there's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
down because if you fall off there's

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.370 
down because if you fall off there's
always<00:03:51.549> something<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:51.970> grab<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:52.900> you're

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
if you're in an island put some water

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.840 
if you're in an island put some water
near<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.530> edge<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.070> case<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.549> an<00:03:57.670> area

near the edge just in case in an area

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.220 
near the edge just in case in an area
where<00:03:58.090> you're<00:03:58.209> most<00:03:58.329> likely<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.780> fall<00:03:58.959> off<00:03:59.110> so

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
where you're most likely to fall off so

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.660 
where you're most likely to fall off so
