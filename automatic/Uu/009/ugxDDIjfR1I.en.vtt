00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello to realize this recipe he 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:15.830
 you need three strips of land from 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 black pepper parsley salt and grated cheese 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 so I start by cutting my 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.590
 potatoes so we see that I have 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.010
 cut each piece of land in half 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.329

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.399
 2 3 mm another part a little big 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.250
 this part it's going to be used in the hat 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.140
 our potato 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:47.039
 then I'll try to beds 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 potatoes here so you can 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:02.149
 stuff them after you can empty them 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:12.360
 with a spoon or anywhere 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:14.430
 everything covered but like that like 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.509

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.420
