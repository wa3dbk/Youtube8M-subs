00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
I drop the RAM quickly so now just a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.860 
I drop the RAM quickly so now just a
matter<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.620> spamming<00:00:46.190> your<00:00:46.940> samurai<00:00:47.270> in<00:00:47.540> there

down the castle we'll go ahead and loop

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.130 
down the castle we'll go ahead and loop
this<00:01:11.540> as<00:01:11.750> well<00:01:16.479> while<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.510> cannon<00:01:18.020> is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
this as well while that cannon is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.860 
this as well while that cannon is
distracted<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.890> can<00:01:19.130> drop<00:01:20.030> your<00:01:20.180> ninjas<00:01:20.690> to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 

it's<00:01:27.480> not<00:01:27.630> necessary<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.620> loot

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's not necessary to take this loot

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.480 
it's not necessary to take this loot
because<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.430> quite<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.730> low<00:01:29.910> amount<00:01:31.340> if<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
because it is quite a low amount if you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
because it is quite a low amount if you
need<00:01:32.670> loot<00:01:32.940> just<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> multiplayer<00:01:34.800> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
need loot just going to multiplayer and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.660 
need loot just going to multiplayer and
get<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.120> there<00:01:36.300> it's<00:01:36.510> much<00:01:36.690> much<00:01:37.110> easier<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.580> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
get it there it's much much easier and a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.450 
get it there it's much much easier and a
lot<00:01:38.790> more

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.550 

so<00:01:44.460> let's<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.730> back<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.230> castle<00:01:46.230> just<00:01:46.410> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so let's get back to this castle just a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.970 
so let's get back to this castle just a
few<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.920> samurai<00:01:47.400> they're<00:01:48.470> almost<00:01:49.470> finished

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
few more samurai they're almost finished

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.840 
few more samurai they're almost finished
off<00:01:54.530> as<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.800> see<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.980> had<00:01:56.130> plenty<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.520> trips

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
off as you can see I had plenty of trips

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.010 
off as you can see I had plenty of trips
with<00:01:56.940> this<00:01:57.150> mission<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.660> not<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
with this mission it's not that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
with this mission it's not that
difficult<00:01:58.230> as<00:01:58.710> long<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.940> right

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
difficult as long as you have the right

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:19.210 
difficult as long as you have the right
tactics

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.370 

so<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.820> used<00:02:20.060> an<00:02:20.210> excessive<00:02:20.720> amount<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:21.080> troops
