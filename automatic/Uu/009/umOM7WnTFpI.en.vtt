00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 rain and took away the little bridge that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 Miss Turtle was next to 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.940
 stream could not pass to the other side 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.850
 but luckily the help had arrived 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.990
 miss turtle how did you get there I went 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.880
 to the farm to shelter from the rain 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.479
 but now the water took the bridge and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.369
 I can not cross the stream and why not 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.390

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.650
