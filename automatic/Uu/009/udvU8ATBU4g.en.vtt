like the home run I guess it tries to
hit<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.229> home<00:01:33.380> run<00:01:33.409> ii<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.649> think<00:01:34.039> it's<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.219> huge

felt he was a very interesting character
in<00:01:58.939> this<00:01:59.149> issue<00:01:59.360> specifically<00:01:59.899> because<00:02:00.110> he

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
in this issue specifically because he

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.969 
in this issue specifically because he

psychoanalyst and she gives him such a
direct<00:02:08.599> response<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.530> what<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:09.829> wrong<00:02:10.069> with

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
sociopath but the important thing he

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.819 
sociopath but the important thing he
says<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.870> he's<00:02:15.109> gonna<00:02:15.230> change<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> world

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so he's not the sociopath anymore that

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.410 
so he's not the sociopath anymore that
he's<00:02:18.049> like<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.500> hero<00:02:18.769> yeah<00:02:19.489> he<00:02:19.819> says<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.269> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
he's like the hero yeah he says if the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.390 
he's like the hero yeah he says if the
world<00:02:20.720> can't<00:02:21.049> see<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> truth<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.829> needs<00:02:22.250> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
world can't see the truth it needs to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.050 
world can't see the truth it needs to
change<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.880> don't<00:02:23.269> need<00:02:23.359> to<00:02:23.510> change<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
change I don't need to change and that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.250 
change I don't need to change and that
just<00:02:26.299> shows<00:02:26.359> so<00:02:26.750> much<00:02:26.959> about<00:02:27.230> who<00:02:27.790> Lex<00:02:28.790> is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
just shows so much about who Lex is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.840 
just shows so much about who Lex is
another<00:02:30.260> reason<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:30.590> really<00:02:30.920> glad<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.190> Lex

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
another reason I'm really glad that Lex

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.309 
another reason I'm really glad that Lex
Luthor<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.239> kind<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> main<00:02:32.780> villains<00:02:33.200> I

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
Luthor is kind of the main villains I

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.440 
Luthor is kind of the main villains I
feel<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.590> he<00:02:33.650> hasn't<00:02:33.769> got<00:02:33.950> enough<00:02:33.980> respect

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
feel like he hasn't got enough respect

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.569 
feel like he hasn't got enough respect
since<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.660> new<00:02:35.750> 52<00:02:35.900> started<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.769> think<00:02:37.400> he's

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
since the new 52 started I think he's

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.750 
since the new 52 started I think he's
arguably<00:02:38.650> one<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> best<00:02:39.829> villains<00:02:40.489> in<00:02:40.639> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
arguably one of the best villains in the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640 
arguably one of the best villains in the
DC<00:02:40.940> Universe<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.630> would<00:02:42.019> say<00:02:42.109> he's<00:02:42.260> right<00:02:42.530> up

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
DC Universe I would say he's right up

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.710 
DC Universe I would say he's right up
there<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:42.889> Joker<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.760> he<00:02:44.389> really<00:02:44.540> hasn't

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
there with Joker but he really hasn't

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.050 
there with Joker but he really hasn't
gotten<00:02:44.930> anything<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> new<00:02:45.799> 52<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.910> mean

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
now yeah it's definitely kind of bridge

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
and she seems to almost make a pass at

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.460 
and she seems to almost make a pass at
Clark<00:03:44.980> Kent<00:03:45.220> which<00:03:45.849> he<00:03:46.209> kind<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.750> rejects<00:03:47.170> and

Clark Kent which he kind of rejects and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.220 
Clark Kent which he kind of rejects and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
John Carroll who was seen her moving in

John Carroll who was seen her moving in
with<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:53.620> Superman<00:03:55.079> it's<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.410> convenient<00:03:56.829> that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
with in Superman it's so convenient that

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.339 
with in Superman it's so convenient that
he<00:03:57.340> was<00:03:57.519> standing<00:03:57.760> right<00:03:58.299> there<00:03:58.359> as<00:03:58.840> soon<00:03:59.200> as

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
he was standing right there as soon as

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.270 
he was standing right there as soon as
Clark<00:03:59.590> leaves<00:03:59.829> Pam<00:04:00.340> swoop<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:02.220> thought<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
Clark leaves Pam swoop it I thought I

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.670 
Clark leaves Pam swoop it I thought I
was<00:04:03.400> kind<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.549> interesting<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.180> Clark

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
was kind of interesting that Clark

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.130 
was kind of interesting that Clark
didn't<00:04:05.680> go<00:04:05.859> for<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:06.220> there<00:04:06.569> he<00:04:07.569> basically<00:04:07.810> said

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
didn't go for it there he basically said

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.900 
didn't go for it there he basically said
it<00:04:08.379> wouldn't<00:04:08.590> have<00:04:08.680> worked<00:04:08.709> out<00:04:08.980> well<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.549> would

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
it wouldn't have worked out well I would

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.849 
it wouldn't have worked out well I would
have<00:04:10.150> only<00:04:10.299> put<00:04:10.540> her<00:04:10.599> in<00:04:10.720> danger<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.680> think

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
have only put her in danger and I think

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:12.990 
have only put her in danger and I think
maybe<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.220> has<00:04:12.340> something<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.640> do<00:04:12.819> with<00:04:12.970> his

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
maybe that has something to do with his

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.819 
maybe that has something to do with his
kind<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.480> new<00:04:13.599> origin<00:04:13.900> story<00:04:14.260> in<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.560> new<00:04:14.680> 52

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
kind of new origin story in the new 52

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.550 
kind of new origin story in the new 52
both<00:04:15.819> his<00:04:15.940> parents<00:04:16.000> are<00:04:16.329> dead<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:17.229> maybe<00:04:17.350> that

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
both his parents are dead so maybe that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.930 
both his parents are dead so maybe that
makes<00:04:17.709> him<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:17.949> little<00:04:18.130> bit<00:04:18.190> more<00:04:18.370> cautious

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
makes him a little bit more cautious

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.439 
makes him a little bit more cautious
than<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:20.169> know<00:04:20.260> before<00:04:20.590> flash<00:04:20.829> point<00:04:21.449> that

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
than you know before flash point that

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.290 
than you know before flash point that
would<00:04:22.860> emphasize<00:04:23.860> why<00:04:24.130> he's<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.580> secure<00:04:25.090> with

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300

the relationship he has a wonder woman

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.830 
the relationship he has a wonder woman

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
because he at least knows that she can

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.960 
because he at least knows that she can
take<00:04:29.080> care<00:04:29.139> of<00:04:29.349> herself<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:30.039> that<00:04:30.849> they're

some<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.639> images<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.120> Superman<00:05:19.539> were<00:05:19.720> just

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
some of the images in Superman were just

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.040 
some of the images in Superman were just
so<00:05:20.229> cool<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.130> look<00:05:21.400> at<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:22.539> really<00:05:22.720> just<00:05:22.900> made

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
so cool to look at it really just made

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.920 
so cool to look at it really just made
him<00:05:23.139> look<00:05:23.229> like<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.470> man<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.949> steel<00:05:24.750> one<00:05:25.750> thing

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
him look like the man of steel one thing

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.870 
him look like the man of steel one thing
I<00:05:26.020> really<00:05:26.289> liked<00:05:26.500> was<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.860> mechs<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.669> thought

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
I really liked was the mechs I thought

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.760 
I really liked was the mechs I thought
that<00:05:28.060> max<00:05:28.270> looked<00:05:28.570> really<00:05:28.870> interesting

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
that max looked really interesting

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.950 
that max looked really interesting
honestly<00:05:30.610> when<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.789> was<00:05:31.000> reading<00:05:31.659> this<00:05:31.750> comic

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
honestly when I was reading this comic

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.080 
honestly when I was reading this comic
it<00:05:32.260> may<00:05:32.860> be<00:05:32.919> reminded<00:05:33.490> me<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:33.610> lot<00:05:33.789> of

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
it may be reminded me a lot of

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.110 
it may be reminded me a lot of
really<00:05:34.690> obscure<00:05:35.110> anime<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.370> well

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
really obscure anime and so well

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.909 
really obscure anime and so well
actually<00:05:37.180> kind<00:05:37.660> of<00:05:37.690> reminded<00:05:37.930> me<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.110> Brainiac

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
actually kind of reminded me of Brainiac

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.120 
actually kind of reminded me of Brainiac
in<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.400> grant<00:05:40.389> morrison's<00:05:40.810> run<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.290> action

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
in the grant morrison's run of action

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.879 
in the grant morrison's run of action
comics<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:42.669> if<00:05:42.820> it's<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.030> little<00:05:43.240> nod<00:05:43.479> to<00:05:43.720> that

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
comics so if it's a little nod to that

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.610 
comics so if it's a little nod to that
it's<00:05:44.889> kind<00:05:45.100> of<00:05:45.130> hard<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.310> say<00:05:45.600> but<00:05:46.600> Tony<00:05:47.290> Daniel

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
it's kind of hard to say but Tony Daniel

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.590 
it's kind of hard to say but Tony Daniel
did<00:05:47.830> do<00:05:47.949> an<00:05:48.070> incredible<00:05:48.400> job<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:49.150> scenery<00:05:49.510> was

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
did do an incredible job the scenery was

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.469 
did do an incredible job the scenery was
great<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:50.740> think<00:05:50.949> in<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.370> Superman<00:05:52.030> title

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
great and I think in a Superman title

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.520 
great and I think in a Superman title
especially<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.860> combat<00:05:54.340> needs<00:05:54.699> to<00:05:54.880> be<00:05:55.530> very

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
especially the combat needs to be very

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.950 
especially the combat needs to be very
well<00:05:56.860> drawn<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:58.479> really<00:05:58.690> needs<00:05:58.870> to

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
well drawn and you really needs to

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.520 
well drawn and you really needs to
emphasize<00:05:59.500> the<00:06:00.490> power<00:06:00.790> that<00:06:01.389> is<00:06:01.630> incorporated

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
emphasize the power that is incorporated

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.250 
emphasize the power that is incorporated
into<00:06:02.710> Superman<00:06:03.280> and<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:04.449> completely<00:06:04.780> agree<00:06:05.050> and

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
into Superman and I completely agree and

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.120 
into Superman and I completely agree and
I<00:06:05.290> think<00:06:05.320> Tony<00:06:05.740> Daniel<00:06:06.070> did<00:06:06.220> that<00:06:06.370> yeah<00:06:08.130> so

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
I think Tony Daniel did that yeah so

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.379 
I think Tony Daniel did that yeah so
those<00:06:09.250> are<00:06:09.280> great<00:06:09.490> for<00:06:09.639> Action<00:06:09.970> Comics<00:06:10.150> number

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389
