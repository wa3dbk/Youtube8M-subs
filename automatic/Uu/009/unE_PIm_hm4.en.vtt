the bike absolute right there and we
have<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:13.640> separate<00:01:14.640> pieces<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.649> take

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
have two separate pieces right here take

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.980 
have two separate pieces right here take
the<00:01:16.799> first<00:01:17.039> one<00:01:17.780> slide<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.539> up<00:01:21.539> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the first one slide it in like so up and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.560 
the first one slide it in like so up and
move<00:01:22.170> our

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
move our

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.190 
move our
the<00:01:23.930> top<00:01:24.200> like<00:01:24.530> this

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.640 

this<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.440> sit<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.890> there

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
this will sit right there

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.880 
this will sit right there
second<00:01:31.520> piece

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.800 

under<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.430> same<00:01:34.580> thing<00:01:35.440> second<00:01:36.440> piece

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.640 

so<00:01:42.369> second<00:01:43.369> piece<00:01:43.579> goes<00:01:43.909> in<00:01:45.009> 60

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.030 

again<00:01:49.310> sits<00:01:50.030> right<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> center<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:51.740> take

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
again sits right in the center it take

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.670 
again sits right in the center it take
bone<00:01:53.000> snaps<00:01:53.420> snap<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.160> take<00:01:55.160> second<00:01:55.820> snob

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.220 

snap<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> in

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
snap it in

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.840 
snap it in
like<00:02:01.620> so<00:02:03.200> okay<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.040> take<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.250> other<00:02:05.400> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
like so okay then you take the other to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.220 
like so okay then you take the other to
make<00:02:06.750> sure<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.200> snug<00:02:07.620> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> inside<00:02:09.230> excel

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
make sure it's snug on the inside excel

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.380 
make sure it's snug on the inside excel
I'm<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> basically<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.150> set<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
I'm going to basically have it set up

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'm going to basically have it set up
right<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:13.340> ok<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.120> what<00:02:15.150> you're<00:02:15.450> going

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
right there ok so then what you're going

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.470 
right there ok so then what you're going
to<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.050> take<00:02:16.080> your<00:02:16.610> clips<00:02:17.610> check<00:02:17.940> these

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
to do is you take your clips check these

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
to do is you take your clips check these
things<00:02:18.870> right<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.110> I'm<00:02:19.740> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> clip<00:02:20.610> it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
things right here I'm going to clip it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.780 
things right here I'm going to clip it
in<00:02:20.990> as<00:02:21.990> tight<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.680> possibly<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
in as tight as you possibly can which is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.380 
in as tight as you possibly can which is
very<00:02:24.030> simple<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> flip<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.900> LexA<00:02:25.350> say<00:02:26.390> just

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
very simple to flip it and LexA say just

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.370 
very simple to flip it and LexA say just
clip<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> clip<00:02:29.070> on<00:02:29.250> each<00:02:29.460> side<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.380> three

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
clip put a clip on each side for three

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.450 
clip put a clip on each side for three
sides<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:33.150> another<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.570> there<00:02:37.460> great

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
sides put another one right there great

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.780 
sides put another one right there great
over<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.830> say<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.310> clipped<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
over here so say now it's clipped in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.240 
over here so say now it's clipped in
then<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> same<00:02:46.110> thing

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
then you do the same thing

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.190 
then you do the same thing
the<00:02:47.670> other<00:02:47.880> side

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.839 

is<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:53.020> clicks<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.560> need<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.860> go<00:02:55.040> so

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
is to more clicks that need to go so

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:03.170 
is to more clicks that need to go so
there's<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.300> right<00:02:56.450> here

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.610 

here<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.980> stays<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.790> place<00:03:06.140> another<00:03:07.140> one

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.660 

here

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.020 

and<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.720> stays<00:03:13.990> in<00:03:14.170> place<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:15.280> last<00:03:15.610> one

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
and that stays in place the last one

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.390 
and that stays in place the last one
we'll<00:03:16.989> go<00:03:17.230> over<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:19.420> side

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.860 

stay<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.269> place<00:03:25.510> just<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:26.709> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
stay in place just like that

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.729 
and it goes to adjust the sensitivity to
it<00:05:16.419> so<00:05:17.419> but<00:05:17.659> that's<00:05:17.869> pretty<00:05:18.139> much<00:05:18.289> what

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:18.739 
it so but that's pretty much what

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:22.250 
it so but that's pretty much what
happens<00:05:19.159> see<00:05:19.969> now<00:05:20.119> it's<00:05:20.299> a<00:05:20.389> steady<00:05:20.689> one

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
happens see now it's a steady one

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.410
