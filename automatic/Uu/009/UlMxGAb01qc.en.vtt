00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the filament so this is the XYZ printing

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260 
the filament so this is the XYZ printing
come<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.289> da<00:00:31.500> Vinci<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.090> can

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
come on it from da Vinci and here we can

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.470 
come on it from da Vinci and here we can
see<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> ABS<00:00:34.260> yellow<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> says<00:00:35.790> 600

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
see it's the ABS yellow now it says 600

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
see it's the ABS yellow now it says 600
green<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:38.120> but<00:00:39.120> Maya<00:00:39.739> scales<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.820> just

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
green so but Maya scales here I'm just

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959 
green so but Maya scales here I'm just
going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> wait<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.280> see<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.789> real

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
going to wait to see what for real

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.100 
going to wait to see what for real
weight<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:48.300> weighs<00:00:48.950> 1000<00:00:50.180> 240<00:00:51.180> grams<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
weight is it weighs 1000 240 grams so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
weight is it weighs 1000 240 grams so
one<00:00:52.410> point<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.949> four<00:00:53.190> kilograms<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> that's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
one point two four kilograms so that's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.420 
one point two four kilograms so that's
how<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.210> I've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.660> black<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:59.100> the

back in the bin yeah right and that's
all<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.930> we've<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:32.630> bag<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.900> silica

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
all there is we've got one bag of silica

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.929 
all there is we've got one bag of silica
gel<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:37.610> then<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.759> an<00:01:38.939> empty<00:01:39.299> cardboard<00:01:39.540> box

so let's put that there this is our

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.889 
so let's put that there this is our
filament<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.619> caution<00:01:47.899> remove

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
filament so here we go caution remove

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.469 
filament so here we go caution remove
this<00:01:49.170> part<00:01:49.470> before<00:01:49.829> using<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.240> your

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this part before using so that's your

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.899 
this part before using so that's your
room<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.470> stop<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.100> stop<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> filament

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
room you stop it to stop the filament

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
room you stop it to stop the filament
from<00:01:54.090> unspooling<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
from unspooling when it's not in the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.060 
from unspooling when it's not in the
printer<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
printer and here we can see it's a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.840 
printer and here we can see it's a
yellow<00:01:59.310> come<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> there's

yellow come on and that's it and there's
the<00:02:03.119> little<00:02:03.270> chip<00:02:04.640> which<00:02:05.640> keeps<00:02:06.000> account<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the little chip which keeps account in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.790 
the little chip which keeps account in
Syria<00:02:07.200> mine

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
Syria mine

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.340 
Syria mine
all<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.430> now<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.210> important<00:02:09.690> question<00:02:09.720> how

all right now the important question how

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.200 
all right now the important question how
what<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.340> weight<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:17.210> one

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
what is the weight of this it is one

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.690 
what is the weight of this it is one
point<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:19.050> five<00:02:19.440> eight<00:02:19.710> kilograms<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:22.700> 1158

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
point one five eight kilograms so 1158

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.630 
point one five eight kilograms so 1158
greens<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.350> know<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:26.130> might<00:02:26.340> actually

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
greens but you know we might actually

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.470 
greens but you know we might actually
have<00:02:27.180> 600<00:02:27.810> grams<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.230> filming<00:02:28.820> let's<00:02:29.820> crack<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
have 600 grams of filming let's crack it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.190 
have 600 grams of filming let's crack it
open<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.020> have<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.320> look<00:02:31.530> okay<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.690> first

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
open and have a look okay now the first

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.290 
open and have a look okay now the first
part<00:02:39.470> we'll<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.160> cut<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:44.300> barcode

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
part we'll just have to cut this barcode

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.490 
part we'll just have to cut this barcode
in<00:02:45.510> half<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:46.140> fine<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:48.140> looks<00:02:49.140> quite

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
in half that's fine I it looks quite

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
in half that's fine I it looks quite
easy<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.480> Logan<00:02:54.260> alright<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.980> seems<00:02:56.220> pretty

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
easy to Logan alright that seems pretty

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.970 
easy to Logan alright that seems pretty
simple<00:02:57.440> yeah<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.250> hopping<00:02:59.610> apart<00:03:03.980> now

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
simple yeah it's just hopping apart now

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
simple yeah it's just hopping apart now
I<00:03:05.280> guess<00:03:05.550> we'll<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.730> pop<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.700> last

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
I guess we'll do this so pop in one last

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.699 
I guess we'll do this so pop in one last
turn<00:03:13.250> there<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.430> go<00:03:14.900> okay<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:17.300> swan<00:03:18.300> during

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
turn there we go okay so swan during

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.770 
turn there we go okay so swan during
each<00:03:19.709> side<00:03:20.810> probably<00:03:21.810> go<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.410> side<00:03:22.650> actually

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
each side probably go this side actually

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.510 
each side probably go this side actually
there<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.050> go<00:03:25.489> okay<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.790> we've<00:03:27.510> got<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.690> open

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
there we go okay so we've got that open

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.000 
there we go okay so we've got that open
and<00:03:29.989> inside<00:03:32.420> we've<00:03:33.420> got<00:03:33.660> one<00:03:34.020> small<00:03:34.620> bag<00:03:34.950> of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and inside we've got one small bag of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.430 
and inside we've got one small bag of
silica<00:03:35.730> gel<00:03:35.940> again<00:03:36.270> now<00:03:36.600> that's<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.110> keep<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
silica gel again now that's to keep the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.720 
silica gel again now that's to keep the
moisture<00:03:37.590> out<00:03:37.940> now<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.390> important<00:03:39.930> thing<00:03:40.730> how

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
moisture out now the important thing how

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.610 
moisture out now the important thing how
much<00:03:41.970> does<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.510> weigh<00:03:43.640> alright<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.350> I've<00:03:46.350> got

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
much does this weigh alright so I've got

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.850 
much does this weigh alright so I've got
my<00:03:46.650> trusty<00:03:47.370> set<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.970> scales<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:51.860> all

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
my trusty set of scales here and all

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.290 
my trusty set of scales here and all
that<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:53.760> feel<00:03:53.910> very<00:03:53.970> heavy<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.720> all<00:03:56.300> okay

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
that doesn't feel very heavy at all okay

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:07.330 
that doesn't feel very heavy at all okay
it<00:03:57.630> is<00:04:03.200> 778<00:04:04.200> grains<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> I'm<00:04:06.180> guessing<00:04:06.750> this

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
it is 778 grains so I'm guessing this

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.600 
it is 778 grains so I'm guessing this
black<00:04:08.340> plastic<00:04:09.290> real<00:04:10.290> wood<00:04:10.769> way<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.100> little<00:04:11.489> bit

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
black plastic real wood way a little bit

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.360 
black plastic real wood way a little bit
so<00:04:12.390> we've<00:04:12.570> got<00:04:13.070> 778<00:04:14.070> greens<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.990> I<00:04:16.370> will

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so we've got 778 greens so the I will

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.009 
so we've got 778 greens so the I will
dare<00:04:17.609> say<00:04:17.910> there<00:04:18.359> is

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
dare say there is

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.860 
dare say there is
grains<00:04:22.349> per<00:04:23.349> filament<00:04:23.949> roll<00:04:24.180> okay<00:04:25.180> which<00:04:25.690> is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
grains per filament roll okay which is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.580 
grains per filament roll okay which is
great<00:04:26.050> news<00:04:26.610> no<00:04:27.610> running<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.389> let's<00:04:29.229> put<00:04:29.470> it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
great news no running so let's put it

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.320 
great news no running so let's put it
back<00:04:29.740> together<00:04:30.810> all<00:04:31.810> right<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.199> just<00:04:32.530> simply

just put it back in here okay okay looks
like<00:04:53.349> am<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.620> let's<00:04:53.860> do<00:04:54.039> what<00:04:55.080> every<00:04:56.080> chance

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.110 

okay<00:05:01.630> all<00:05:02.409> right<00:05:02.590> now<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.580> important<00:05:04.090> thing

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
okay all right now the important thing

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.999 
okay all right now the important thing
to<00:05:04.330> note<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:05.319> use<00:05:07.080> edit<00:05:08.080> nice<00:05:08.319> food<00:05:08.650> through

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
to note you use edit nice food through

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.270 
to note you use edit nice food through
this<00:05:09.330> little<00:05:10.330> cleaner<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.409> it's<00:05:11.590> got<00:05:12.069> some

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
this little cleaner so it's got some

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.909 
this little cleaner so it's got some
rather<00:05:12.550> better<00:05:12.849> feed<00:05:13.210> through<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.289> just

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
rather better feed through and that just

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.920 
rather better feed through and that just
points<00:05:15.669> all<00:05:15.819> this<00:05:16.000> stuff<00:05:16.360> off<00:05:16.569> the<00:05:16.599> edges

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
points all this stuff off the edges

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.170 
points all this stuff off the edges
epsilon<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.620> ok<00:05:18.509> all<00:05:19.509> right<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:19.990> now<00:05:21.180> we'll

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
epsilon it ok all right so now we'll

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.370 
epsilon it ok all right so now we'll
just<00:05:23.039> line<00:05:24.039> that<00:05:24.069> up<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.719> put<00:05:25.719> the<00:05:25.870> plug<00:05:26.169> in

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
just line that up and put the plug in

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.999 
just line that up and put the plug in
again<00:05:27.690> now<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.750> plug<00:05:29.139> long<00:05:29.440> but<00:05:29.680> are<00:05:29.830> these

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
again now the plug long but are these

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.129 
again now the plug long but are these
little<00:05:30.280> holes<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.389> just<00:05:31.630> spots<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
little holes and it just spots the

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.080 
little holes and it just spots the
school<00:05:32.409> from<00:05:32.710> behind<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:34.300> that's<00:05:34.479> cool

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
school from behind you so that's cool

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.219 
school from behind you so that's cool
all<00:05:37.090> right<00:05:38.460> all<00:05:39.460> right<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.759> now<00:05:39.789> we'll<00:05:40.229> just

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
all right all right and now we'll just

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.309 
all right all right and now we'll just
make<00:05:41.529> sure<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.949> chip<00:05:42.639> still<00:05:43.360> they<00:05:43.539> see<00:05:44.169> the

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
make sure the chip still they see the

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.809 
make sure the chip still they see the
little<00:05:44.440> check<00:05:44.680> now<00:05:45.479> this<00:05:46.479> very<00:05:47.409> important<00:05:48.069> ok

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
little check now this very important ok

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.510 
little check now this very important ok
so<00:05:49.270> I'll<00:05:50.050> just<00:05:50.110> pop<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.469> in<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.979> corner<00:05:51.340> oh

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
so I'll just pop that in the corner oh

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.640 
so I'll just pop that in the corner oh
well<00:05:52.509> actually<00:05:52.630> they're<00:05:53.050> headed<00:05:53.349> in<00:05:53.469> this

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
well actually they're headed in this

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.920 
well actually they're headed in this
corner<00:05:54.069> so<00:05:54.340> so<00:05:54.699> i'll<00:05:54.849> put<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.090> backward<00:05:55.479> end<00:05:56.310> and

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
corner so so i'll put a backward end and

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.610 
corner so so i'll put a backward end and
carefully<00:05:59.610> along<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.849> edges<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.840> to<00:06:02.500> be

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
carefully along the edges in to be

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.600 
carefully along the edges in to be
careful<00:06:03.009> of<00:06:03.069> that<00:06:03.099> chip<00:06:03.550> let's<00:06:03.909> go<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:06.190> sounds

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
careful of that chip let's go it sounds

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:14.260 
careful of that chip let's go it sounds
bad<00:06:06.759> but<00:06:06.819> it's<00:06:07.199> actually<00:06:08.199> it's<00:06:08.830> all<00:06:08.949> good

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
there we go in the hizzle government end

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.970 
there we go in the hizzle government end
and<00:06:22.430> they've<00:06:23.150> got<00:06:23.360> a<00:06:23.390> whole<00:06:23.840> key<00:06:24.200> so<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:24.710> can

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
and they've got a whole key so you can

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.540 
and they've got a whole key so you can
just<00:06:25.010> plug<00:06:25.460> it<00:06:25.640> in<00:06:26.950> until<00:06:27.950> you're<00:06:28.280> ready<00:06:28.460> to
