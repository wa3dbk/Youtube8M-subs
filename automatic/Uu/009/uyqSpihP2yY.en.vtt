00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.760
 such a clear menu 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.380

 repeater is not so necessary here right here 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.020

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.290
 we have 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.870
 network one click on it further 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.870
 enter the password to this network 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.010
 now you know my password apply 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:14.580
