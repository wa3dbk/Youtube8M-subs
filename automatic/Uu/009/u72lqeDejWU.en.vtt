that we can capture which in this case
is<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.300> henge<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.560> wait<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.010> node<00:00:23.220> to

is the henge so we wait for that node to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.950 
is the henge so we wait for that node to

to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.469> increase<00:00:40.920> damage<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.579> that's<00:00:41.730> because

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to do increase damage and that's because

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.860 
to do increase damage and that's because
I'm<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.290> necessarily<00:00:44.120> glass<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.840> a

I'm not necessarily glass I'm not a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
glass cannon character but almost all of

glass cannon character but almost all of
my<00:00:49.890> uptime<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> predicated<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> notion<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
my uptime is predicated on the notion of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
my uptime is predicated on the notion of
avoiding<00:00:52.500> damage<00:00:52.680> completely<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.449> way

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
avoiding damage completely so the way

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.729 
avoiding damage completely so the way
that<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.840> stay<00:00:55.260> alive<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.949> by<00:00:56.520> being<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.780> where

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that I stay alive is by being not where

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099 
that I stay alive is by being not where
the<00:00:58.890> enemy<00:00:59.219> thinks<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.640> am<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> look

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the enemy thinks I am but if you look

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
the enemy thinks I am but if you look
here<00:01:01.350> we've<00:01:01.500> already<00:01:01.680> made<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> mistake<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
here we've already made a mistake the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
here we've already made a mistake the
enemy<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.660> moved<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> henge<00:01:04.680> because

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
enemy has moved in on the henge because

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.859 
enemy has moved in on the henge because
we've<00:01:05.220> left<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> too<00:01:05.729> early<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.420> stay<00:01:06.659> here

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
we've left it too early so we stay here

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
we've left it too early so we stay here
and<00:01:06.930> try<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.200> capture<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> keep<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> as

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and try and capture the keep and as

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.969 
and try and capture the keep and as
we're<00:01:08.970> waiting<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.780> an<00:01:09.930> enemy<00:01:10.530> drops<00:01:10.799> down

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we're waiting here an enemy drops down

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
we're waiting here an enemy drops down
from<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> side<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> dodge<00:01:12.299> roll<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.350> rush

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
from the side so I dodge roll and I rush

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
from the side so I dodge roll and I rush
into<00:01:13.979> attack<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.210> three<00:01:15.750> against<00:01:16.080> one

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
into attack and it's three against one

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.039 
into attack and it's three against one
and<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.619> guy<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.479> not<00:01:18.479> too<00:01:18.659> durable

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and this guy is actually not too durable

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.550 
and this guy is actually not too durable
at<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.340> set<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
at all so I set up here and I get the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
at all so I set up here and I get the
stump<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> we've<00:01:23.520> defended<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> node<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
stump and we've defended the node and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
stump and we've defended the node and
now<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> make<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> choice<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> strategic

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
now I make a choice and it's a strategic

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
now I make a choice and it's a strategic
choice<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:28.229> early<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> match<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.430> need

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
choice it's early in the match we need

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.399 
choice it's early in the match we need
control<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> battlefield<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.110> else<00:01:31.259> we're

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
control of the battlefield or else we're

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
control of the battlefield or else we're
not<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> win<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.790> unless<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
not really going to win right unless we

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
not really going to win right unless we
really<00:01:33.479> pull<00:01:33.780> off<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.140> miracle<00:01:34.590> kills<00:01:34.860> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
thieves are about to go away because

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
thieves are about to go away because

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
look and it turns out that the enemies

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.340 
look and it turns out that the enemies
are<00:05:54.120> rushing<00:05:55.120> towards<00:05:55.480> our<00:05:55.630> position<00:05:56.080> but

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
are rushing towards our position but

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.680 
are rushing towards our position but
we're<00:05:56.530> doing<00:05:56.800> good<00:05:56.980> but<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.490> pretty<00:05:58.150> decent<00:05:58.630> job

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
we're doing good but a pretty decent job

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.160 
we're doing good but a pretty decent job
of<00:05:59.220> keeping<00:06:00.220> them<00:06:00.520> at<00:06:01.270> least<00:06:01.510> away<00:06:01.810> from<00:06:02.050> the

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
of keeping them at least away from the

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.980 
of keeping them at least away from the
node<00:06:02.380> right<00:06:03.300> so<00:06:04.300> I'm<00:06:04.390> going<00:06:04.540> to<00:06:04.570> stay<00:06:04.810> down

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
node right so I'm going to stay down

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.510 
node right so I'm going to stay down
here<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.380> I'm<00:06:05.590> not<00:06:05.740> even<00:06:05.890> going<00:06:06.130> to<00:06:06.190> change<00:06:06.460> my

weapon<00:06:06.970> set<00:06:07.180> to<00:06:07.360> ranged<00:06:07.810> I'm<00:06:07.990> just<00:06:08.380> going<00:06:08.680> to

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
weapon set to ranged I'm just going to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.880 
weapon set to ranged I'm just going to
drop<00:06:10.120> in<00:06:10.420> every<00:06:10.750> now<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.110> then<00:06:11.230> an<00:06:11.500> attack

drop in every now and then an attack
this<00:06:12.220> guy's<00:06:12.400> overextended<00:06:13.180> so<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:13.390> do<00:06:13.510> some

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
this guy's overextended so I do some

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.270 
this guy's overextended so I do some
decent<00:06:14.200> burst<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.620> I'm<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:14.860> chase<00:06:15.100> them

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
decent burst and I'm going to chase them

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.610 
decent burst and I'm going to chase them
down<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.760> do<00:06:15.970> whatever<00:06:16.150> I<00:06:16.300> can<00:06:16.450> but<00:06:16.900> in<00:06:17.530> the

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
down and do whatever I can but in the

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.190 
down and do whatever I can but in the
process<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:18.130> overextend<00:06:18.880> myself<00:06:18.940> so<00:06:19.900> i<00:06:19.930> use

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
process I overextend myself so i use

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.230 
process I overextend myself so i use
withdraw<00:06:20.680> here<00:06:21.010> and<00:06:21.190> when<00:06:21.640> I<00:06:21.670> use<00:06:21.940> it<00:06:22.120> I

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
withdraw here and when I use it I

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.750 
withdraw here and when I use it I
traverse<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.900> entire<00:06:23.170> height<00:06:23.950> of<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.400> stairs

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
traverse the entire height of the stairs

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.160 
traverse the entire height of the stairs
so<00:06:25.570> I'm<00:06:25.810> completely<00:06:26.320> out<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:26.740> any<00:06:28.170> ranged

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
so I'm completely out of any ranged

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.740 
so I'm completely out of any ranged
attacks<00:06:29.770> or<00:06:30.100> any<00:06:30.490> damage<00:06:30.970> that<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.360> enemy<00:06:31.570> can

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
attacks or any damage that the enemy can

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.290 
attacks or any damage that the enemy can
do<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.320> in<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.830> process<00:06:33.040> my<00:06:33.669> teammates<00:06:34.090> have

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
do and in the process my teammates have

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.140 
do and in the process my teammates have
burned<00:06:34.570> down

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
burned down

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.510 
burned down
the<00:06:35.480> attackers<00:06:35.960> who<00:06:36.200> are<00:06:36.290> trying<00:06:36.950> to<00:06:37.190> take<00:06:37.340> our

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
the attackers who are trying to take our

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.150 
the attackers who are trying to take our
position<00:06:37.970> and<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:39.050> stress<00:06:39.350> test<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:39.890> almost

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
position and the stress test is almost

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.210 
position and the stress test is almost
over<00:06:40.520> the<00:06:40.700> match<00:06:41.000> is<00:06:41.210> almost<00:06:41.450> over<00:06:41.810> so<00:06:42.620> we

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
over the match is almost over so we

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.220 
over the match is almost over so we
decide<00:06:43.580> to<00:06:43.610> just<00:06:44.000> head<00:06:44.300> towards<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.690> mine

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
decide to just head towards the mine

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.380 
decide to just head towards the mine
here<00:06:45.530> at<00:06:45.680> least<00:06:45.830> I<00:06:45.950> do<00:06:46.010> because<00:06:46.790> I<00:06:46.850> see<00:06:47.090> that

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
here at least I do because I see that

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.150 
here at least I do because I see that
there's<00:06:47.540> only<00:06:47.720> one<00:06:48.020> enemy<00:06:48.200> there<00:06:48.500> and<00:06:48.740> I'm

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
there's only one enemy there and I'm

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.620 
there's only one enemy there and I'm
pretty<00:06:49.370> confident<00:06:49.760> I<00:06:49.910> can<00:06:49.970> take<00:06:50.210> them<00:06:50.390> so<00:06:50.600> I

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
pretty confident I can take them so I

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.440 
pretty confident I can take them so I
rush<00:06:51.050> in<00:06:51.260> with<00:06:51.530> unload<00:06:51.950> I<00:06:52.160> chill<00:06:52.490> them<00:06:52.730> that

rush in with unload I chill them that

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.920 
rush in with unload I chill them that
manages<00:06:54.200> to<00:06:54.640> slow<00:06:55.640> down<00:06:55.880> their<00:06:56.300> movement<00:06:56.750> and

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
manages to slow down their movement and

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.000 
manages to slow down their movement and
their<00:06:57.520> cooldowns<00:06:58.520> for<00:06:59.030> a<00:06:59.060> minute<00:06:59.300> or<00:06:59.450> two<00:06:59.630> and

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010
