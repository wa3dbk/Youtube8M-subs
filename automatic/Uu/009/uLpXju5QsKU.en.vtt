in<00:00:04.700> this<00:00:05.700> module<00:00:06.950> you'll<00:00:07.950> learn<00:00:08.040> about<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
in this module you'll learn about the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.959 
in this module you'll learn about the
internal<00:00:09.150> structure<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> earth<00:00:13.969> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
internal structure of the earth to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.500 
internal structure of the earth to
understand<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> structure<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> earth

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
understand the structure of the earth

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
understand the structure of the earth
first<00:00:18.510> let's<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> background<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.609> the
