00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.080
 here leads apple blog I'm just on the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.560
 stood by intel and we have one here 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.170
 new bed rail tablet from how far the 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.830
 That's kind of a doctor's office pro 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 plus 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.280
 we see that pulls out 11.6 inches 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.440
 full hd display so 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.520
 and the 1.6ghz quad core processor this 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.660
 probably will not be in now 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 Germany, however, appear similar 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.310
 devices are supposed to be on september 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 market comes we'll see very quickly 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.920
 a little performance is going on here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.550
 everything pretty fast 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.440
 The battery life is just at 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 about six hours but they want that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 worldwide platform here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 to optimize this system is that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:56.550
 It will take up to ten hours to arrive 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.280
 we also use the 1.6ghz quad core gateway 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.610
 Processor 4GB Operative memory sees it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 just a normal hard drive supposedly 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.280
 no ssd and yes what still have 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.119
 already the tablet around so only one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.979
 webcam 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.810
 then first we have below the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 windows home button whole and keyboard 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.580
 this is very reminiscent of the touch chamber 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.350
 from microsoft such a kind of service office 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.110
 There is no room for a core processor here 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 to have 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.230
 the temperature is pretty good on the bar 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.210
 write it much better as well 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.620
 to the touch body just with the body 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.360
 noticed something similar 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.800
 the segway could be a bit bigger 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.900
 but otherwise this is very nice 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.270
 Of course everything plastic is just 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.040
 combo cheaper model 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.320
 we have a power button up here 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.660
 or that was already like pages 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.890
 usb 3.0 port a hdmi output one 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.020
 micro sd card slot 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 they have nothing left when we return 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.430
 time we have one here 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.630
 camera with a led lightning actually 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.750
 and then such a place is so 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.540
 but a bit in the service office 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.500
 ajar act here in the page 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.630
 then a quarter of the audio output 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.369
 volume what that is here comes to me 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.700
 the guys of intel do not say yet 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.260
 possibly for an optional 3g 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.660
 model but here is nothing 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 behind what you can so it works 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.040
 not and what is it doing so well 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.120
 do not know yourself yet 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.280
 to see if now on the market 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.260
 even if Germany is the case 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.870
 will be if he give in china anyway 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.420
 the power connection and that's it 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.940
 that the baby falls tablet 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.890
 such a kind folk is worth it I'm a genius 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 to see for tablet pcs
