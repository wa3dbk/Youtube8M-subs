00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
video the 1003 DX is about as powerful

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.790 
video the 1003 DX is about as powerful
as<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.550> any<00:00:18.529> portable<00:00:19.529> an

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
as you can get on any portable an

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.490 
as you can get on any portable an
extractor<00:00:20.369> that's<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.670> two<00:00:20.850> cords<00:00:21.320> it's<00:00:22.320> got

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
extractor that's on two cords it's got

we've got 12 PL and recovery tank 1003
DX<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:31.850> 2000<00:00:32.850> watt<00:00:33.000> heater<00:00:33.360> there<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
DX you have a 2000 watt heater there the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
DX you have a 2000 watt heater there the
great<00:00:34.469> thing<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:35.370> in-line<00:00:35.910> heater<00:00:36.270> if

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
great thing about an in-line heater if

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.139 
great thing about an in-line heater if
it's<00:00:36.960> plumbed<00:00:37.350> correctly<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.940> heater

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it's plumbed correctly is the heater

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
it's plumbed correctly is the heater
goes<00:00:39.390> after<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.110> pump<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.980> important

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
goes after the pump and that's important

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
goes after the pump and that's important
because<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.450> don't<00:00:42.690> want<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.530> heated<00:00:43.920> water

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because you don't want the heated water

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
because you don't want the heated water
going<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> pump<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:45.329> gonna

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
going into the pump because that's gonna

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.290 
going into the pump because that's gonna
reduce<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> life<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.980> your<00:00:47.250> pump<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.120> don't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
reduce the life of your pump you don't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
reduce the life of your pump you don't
want<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> pump<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> last<00:00:49.980> as

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
want that you want the pump to last as

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580 
want that you want the pump to last as
long<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.820> possible<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> great

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
long as possible so that's the great

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.990 
long as possible so that's the great
thing<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> 2000<00:00:53.879> watt

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
thing about this one the 2000 watt

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
thing about this one the 2000 watt
heater<00:00:54.329> which<00:00:54.600> gets<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.559> hot<00:00:55.770> really<00:00:56.129> fast

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
heater which gets really hot really fast

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.740 
heater which gets really hot really fast
is<00:00:57.030> plumbed<00:00:57.449> after<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> pump<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.570> pumps

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
is plumbed after the pump so your pumps

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
is plumbed after the pump so your pumps
gonna<00:01:00.840> take<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> cold<00:01:01.469> water<00:01:01.710> move<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
gonna take in cold water move it to the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
gonna take in cold water move it to the
heater<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.210> give<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.809> long<00:01:04.080> life

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
heater it's gonna give you a long life

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.660 
heater it's gonna give you a long life
on<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.680> pump<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.900> other<00:01:07.020> great<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.500> about

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
on your pump the other great thing about

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
on your pump the other great thing about
the<00:01:08.810> 1003<00:01:09.810> DX<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> pump<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> 500<00:01:12.510> psi

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the 1003 DX is the pump it's a 500 psi

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560 
the 1003 DX is the pump it's a 500 psi
pump<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.090> regulate<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pump but what we do is we regulate it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.950 
pump but what we do is we regulate it
down<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> 450<00:01:16.680> psi<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.360> cautious<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
down to 450 psi now be cautious of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510 
down to 450 psi now be cautious of
machines<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.040> advertise

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
machines out there that that advertise

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
machines out there that that advertise
500<00:01:21.119> psi<00:01:21.979> 500<00:01:22.979> psi<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.369> great<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.600> pump<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
500 psi 500 psi is great but the pump is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
500 psi 500 psi is great but the pump is
running<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> hard<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> reduce<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.630> life

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
running so hard that you reduce the life

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
running so hard that you reduce the life
your<00:01:27.990> pump<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.400> need<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> don't

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
your pump you don't need that you don't

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
your pump you don't need that you don't
we<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.630> pump<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
we don't want your pump to go down and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
we don't want your pump to go down and
if<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.070> doesn't<00:01:32.280> need<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.670> down<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
if it doesn't need to be down for

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140 
if it doesn't need to be down for
maintenance<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:34.380> reducing<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.820> pressure

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
maintenance so by reducing the pressure

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.609 
maintenance so by reducing the pressure
down<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> we've<00:01:37.079> increased<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
down a little that we've increased the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.760 
down a little that we've increased the
life<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> motor<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.659> 450<00:01:39.659> psi<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> plenty

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
life of the motor and 450 psi is plenty

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.690 
life of the motor and 450 psi is plenty
of<00:01:40.950> pressure<00:01:41.880> especially<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.750> using

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
of pressure especially when you're using

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
of pressure especially when you're using
2,000<00:01:44.700> watts<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.970> heat<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.390> conjunction<00:01:46.049> with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
2,000 watts of heat in conjunction with

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
2,000 watts of heat in conjunction with
that<00:01:47.210> also<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.570> adjustable<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that also it's adjustable so you can you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
that also it's adjustable so you can you
can<00:01:50.939> bring<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> pressure<00:01:51.390> down

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
can bring the pressure down

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.040 
can bring the pressure down
50<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.950> 200<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:54.150> can<00:01:54.180> bring<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:54.600> even

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
50 to 200 you can bring it down even

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.690 
50 to 200 you can bring it down even
less<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> 50<00:01:55.710> psi<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.580> do

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
less to 50 psi if you want to do

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.390 
less to 50 psi if you want to do
upholstery<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.080> got<00:01:58.409> some<00:01:58.440> flexibility

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
upholstery so it's got some flexibility

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.240 
upholstery so it's got some flexibility
there<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.150> pump<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.710> got<00:02:01.860> two

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
there in the pump also it's got two

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.490 
there in the pump also it's got two

it<00:02:40.620> runs<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.070> two<00:02:41.370> quarts<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.880> said<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
it runs on two quarts like I said it's

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.500 
it runs on two quarts like I said it's
about<00:02:42.300> as<00:02:42.600> powerful<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.440> get<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
about as powerful as you can get in a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.860 
about as powerful as you can get in a
portable<00:02:45.810> unit<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.489> two<00:02:47.700> cords<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
portable unit so it's two cords the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.710 
portable unit so it's two cords the
machine<00:02:49.140> comes<00:02:49.260> with<00:02:49.370> 250<00:02:50.370> foot<00:02:50.580> cords<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
machine comes with 250 foot cords so it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.320 
machine comes with 250 foot cords so it
gives<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.050> lot<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.320> flexibility<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.430> need

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
gives you a lot of flexibility you need

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.570 
gives you a lot of flexibility you need
two<00:02:54.480> cords<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.310> power

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
two cords because of the power

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.780 
two cords because of the power
consumption<00:02:57.120> that's<00:02:57.390> being<00:02:57.600> used<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
consumption that's being used but to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.449 
consumption that's being used but to
make<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> easy<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:01.560> finding<00:03:02.010> two

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
make it easy on you because finding two

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.789 
make it easy on you because finding two
two<00:03:03.180> outlets<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.780> one<00:03:03.959> thing<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.260> finding<00:03:04.620> two

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
two outlets is one thing but finding two

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.430 
two outlets is one thing but finding two
separate<00:03:05.160> circuits<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.910> another<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.660> so

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
separate circuits is another thing so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.229 
separate circuits is another thing so
how<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.769> do<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.070> efficiently<00:03:08.670> without

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
how do you do that efficiently without

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.280 
how do you do that efficiently without
wasting<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.840> lot<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.019> time<00:03:10.459> what<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.579> do<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.959> we

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
wasting a lot of time what we do is we

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.009 
wasting a lot of time what we do is we
put<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:14.310> amber<00:03:15.030> colored<00:03:15.420> light<00:03:15.720> on

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
put this little amber colored light on

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.430 
put this little amber colored light on
the<00:03:16.620> switch<00:03:16.860> plate<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.840> when<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.079> plug<00:03:19.290> in

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the switch plate so when you plug in

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.650 
the switch plate so when you plug in
your<00:03:19.530> cords<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.040> you're<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.310> two<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:21.570> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
your cords and you're on two so when you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.420 
your cords and you're on two so when you
plug<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.019> your<00:03:22.110> cords<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.860> you're<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.190> two

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
can't think of it electrical converter

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.310 
can't think of it electrical converter
to<00:06:16.030> make<00:06:16.180> finding<00:06:16.510> what<00:06:16.720> easier<00:06:20.280> okay<00:06:21.280> okay

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
to make finding what easier okay okay

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.870 
to make finding what easier okay okay
and<00:06:23.320> to<00:06:23.860> make<00:06:24.010> sure<00:06:24.160> you<00:06:24.250> have<00:06:24.400> all<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:24.669> power

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
and to make sure you have all the power

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.120 
and to make sure you have all the power
you<00:06:25.030> need<00:06:25.360> don't<00:06:26.200> forget<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:26.590> electrical

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
you need don't forget the electrical

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.490 
you need don't forget the electrical
converter<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:30.010> to<00:06:30.190> me<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:31.140> think<00:06:32.140> it<00:06:32.290> could

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
converter and to me I think it could

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.230 
converter and to me I think it could
work

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
work

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.260
