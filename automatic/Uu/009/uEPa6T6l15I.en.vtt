from<00:02:26.390> your<00:02:26.510> hand<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:27.860> gotta<00:02:28.010> be<00:02:28.069> careful

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
from your hand and you gotta be careful

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.470 
from your hand and you gotta be careful
because<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.760> don't<00:02:28.880> want<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.060> lose<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
because you don't want to lose all the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
because you don't want to lose all the
cards<00:02:29.720> from<00:02:29.810> your<00:02:29.870> hand<00:02:29.989> because<00:02:30.290> then<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
cards from your hand because then you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.390 
cards from your hand because then you
will<00:02:30.650> crash

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
will crash

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.080 
will crash
now<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:33.260> after<00:02:33.980> you've<00:02:34.160> changed<00:02:34.730> your<00:02:34.849> speed

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
now then after you've changed your speed

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.850 
now then after you've changed your speed
you<00:02:35.270> will<00:02:35.390> move<00:02:35.510> forward<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.020> speed<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.650> I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
you will move forward that speed so I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530 
you will move forward that speed so I
have<00:02:37.459> my<00:02:37.550> speed<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.819> two<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.300> will<00:02:38.450> go

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
have my speed is two so I will go

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.760 
have my speed is two so I will go
forward<00:02:38.780> two<00:02:39.020> spaces<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:39.770> one<00:02:40.069> two<00:02:40.760> now<00:02:41.770> why

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
forward two spaces so one two now why

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.850 
forward two spaces so one two now why
don't<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> new<00:02:44.300> card<00:02:44.690> see<00:02:45.620> there

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
don't I go on to a new card see there

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.790 
don't I go on to a new card see there
I've<00:02:46.190> gone<00:02:46.520> into<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.819> new<00:02:47.030> card<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.319> turn

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
I've gone into a new card that is a turn

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.920 
I've gone into a new card that is a turn
and<00:02:49.069> each<00:02:49.430> turn<00:02:49.760> has<00:02:50.000> either<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.300> yellow<00:02:50.599> or<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and each turn has either a yellow or a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.600 
and each turn has either a yellow or a
red<00:02:51.500> thing<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.250> corner

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
red thing in the corner

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.000 
red thing in the corner
I<00:02:52.730> must<00:02:53.420> discard<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.959> card<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.440> same<00:02:54.650> type

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
I must discard a card of the same type

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.040 
I must discard a card of the same type
that's<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.400> yellow<00:02:55.610> curve<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.569> discard<00:02:56.810> a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
that's a yellow curve so I discard a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.920 
that's a yellow curve so I discard a
yellow<00:02:57.230> curve<00:02:57.520> if<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.819> change<00:02:59.209> lanes<00:02:59.540> which<00:02:59.810> I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
yellow curve if I change lanes which I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.440 
yellow curve if I change lanes which I
did<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.140> do<00:03:00.560> here<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.670> change<00:03:01.910> lanes<00:03:02.270> I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
did not do here but if I change lanes I

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.660 
did not do here but if I change lanes I
need<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.690> discard<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.170> card<00:03:03.200> from<00:03:03.590> my<00:03:03.620> hand<00:03:03.739> if<00:03:04.189> I

different<00:03:14.600> things<00:03:14.840> for<00:03:15.080> example<00:03:15.140> let's<00:03:16.010> say

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
different things for example let's say

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.540 
different things for example let's say
the<00:03:16.280> track<00:03:16.520> was<00:03:16.700> like<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:18.200> had<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.770> hit

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
the track was like this and I had to hit

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.730 
the track was like this and I had to hit
this<00:03:19.819> whatever<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.870> pothole<00:03:21.410> or<00:03:21.500> what

this whatever that is pothole or what

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.650 
this whatever that is pothole or what
have<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.760> wouldn't<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.330> discard

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
have you then I wouldn't have to discard

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.230 
have you then I wouldn't have to discard
a<00:03:23.780> card<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.350> -<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.760> faster<00:03:26.090> you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
a card for that - so the faster you

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.340 
a card for that - so the faster you
going<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> more<00:03:26.720> cards<00:03:27.050> you're<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
going the more cards you're going to

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.810 
going the more cards you're going to
have<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.560> discard<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.310> drive<00:03:28.610> over

players<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.910> pull<00:04:02.239> into<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.510> garage<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
players can pull into the garage the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.949 
players can pull into the garage the
heal<00:04:03.170> up<00:04:03.320> their<00:04:03.530> movement<00:04:04.430> points<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:04.970> that's

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
heal up their movement points and that's

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.630 
heal up their movement points and that's
basically<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.830> first<00:04:07.040> person<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.430> get

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
basically it the first person to get

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.050 
basically it the first person to get
around<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.970> track<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:09.200> winner<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.910> said

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
around the track is the winner you said

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.699 
around the track is the winner you said
I<00:04:11.120> mean<00:04:11.239> about<00:04:11.420> thinking<00:04:11.840> it's<00:04:12.080> not<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.530> this

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
I mean about thinking it's not like this

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.390 
I mean about thinking it's not like this
is<00:04:12.890> an<00:04:12.980> exciting<00:04:13.459> race<00:04:15.040> because<00:04:16.040> when<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.280> go

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
is an exciting race because when you go

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.069 
is an exciting race because when you go
around<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:16.970> switch<00:04:17.269> lanes<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.019> you

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
around and you switch lanes and you

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.990 
around and you switch lanes and you
curve<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.680> can<00:04:18.829> push<00:04:19.100> other<00:04:19.310> cars<00:04:19.669> when

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
curve and you can push other cars when

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.950 
curve and you can push other cars when
you<00:04:20.090> move<00:04:20.329> and<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:22.240> hit<00:04:23.240> another<00:04:23.540> car<00:04:23.900> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
you move and you can hit another car and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.500 
you move and you can hit another car and
cause<00:04:24.830> them<00:04:25.220> some<00:04:25.250> damage<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.300> reality

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
cause them some damage but in reality

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.180 
cause them some damage but in reality
you're<00:04:27.229> just<00:04:27.290> sitting<00:04:27.680> there<00:04:27.710> each<00:04:27.950> turn

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
you're just sitting there each turn

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.680 
you're just sitting there each turn
looking<00:04:28.520> at<00:04:28.580> your<00:04:28.700> hand<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:28.970> cards<00:04:29.150> trying<00:04:29.600> to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
looking at your hand of cards trying to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.000 
looking at your hand of cards trying to
think<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.020> best<00:04:30.200> way<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.380> play<00:04:30.710> all<00:04:30.890> the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
think it the best way to play all the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.590 
think it the best way to play all the
cards<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.460> possibly<00:04:31.640> can<00:04:32.060> without

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
cards that you possibly can without

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.630 
cards that you possibly can without
getting<00:04:33.140> too<00:04:33.290> many<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:34.040> person<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.430> first

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
getting too many the person to first

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.580 
getting too many the person to first
place<00:04:34.880> always<00:04:35.090> draws<00:04:35.390> three<00:04:35.810> cards<00:04:36.200> person

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
place always draws three cards person

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.200 
place always draws three cards person
last<00:04:36.740> place<00:04:36.979> draws<00:04:37.250> five<00:04:37.580> everyone<00:04:37.940> else

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
last place draws five everyone else

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.600 
last place draws five everyone else
draws<00:04:38.419> four<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.560> can<00:04:39.830> kind<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.130> gauge<00:04:40.370> in

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
draws four so you can kind of gauge in

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.360 
draws four so you can kind of gauge in
how<00:04:40.729> many<00:04:40.910> cards<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.450> use<00:04:41.660> each<00:04:41.870> turn<00:04:42.370> or

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
how many cards you can use each turn or

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.800 
how many cards you can use each turn or
you<00:04:43.550> can<00:04:43.669> use<00:04:43.790> more<00:04:44.060> than<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.360> suppose<00:04:44.660> but

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
you can use more than that I suppose but

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.150 
you can use more than that I suppose but
then<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.020> won't<00:04:45.200> have<00:04:45.320> as<00:04:45.380> many<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.830> future

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
then you won't have as many for future

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.510 
then you won't have as many for future
turns<00:04:46.400> it's<00:04:47.240> it's<00:04:47.750> not<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> bad<00:04:48.380> game<00:04:48.830> it's<00:04:49.430> not

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
turns it's it's not a bad game it's not

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.610 
turns it's it's not a bad game it's not
a<00:04:49.580> bad<00:04:49.760> design<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.180> guess<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.600> should<00:04:50.780> say<00:04:50.990> it

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
a bad design I guess I should say it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.860 
a bad design I guess I should say it
works<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.220> makes<00:04:52.400> sense<00:04:52.669> your<00:04:53.060> speed<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.690> hit

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
works it makes sense your speed you hit

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.380 
works it makes sense your speed you hit
it's<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.039> game<00:04:55.280> itself<00:04:55.700> after<00:04:56.360> a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
it's just that the game itself after a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.540 
it's just that the game itself after a
while<00:04:56.510> it's<00:04:56.930> kind<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.350> drudgery<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.130> game

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
while it's kind of drudgery and game

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.580 
while it's kind of drudgery and game
game<00:04:59.390> racing<00:04:59.900> games<00:05:00.080> should<00:05:00.260> be<00:05:00.320> something

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
game racing games should be something

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.100 
game racing games should be something
let's<00:05:01.250> go<00:05:01.430> necks<00:05:02.120> roll<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.419> dice<00:05:02.600> move<00:05:02.870> here
