00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.089
 Central American games and I think I'm going to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.090
 look for them in four years yes this 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.570
 and then start my cycle 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.909
 olympic which is in 2016 good was 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.280
 very focused I knew the competition 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.129
 that I had next that for example was 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.050
 Colombia was puerto rico but never 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.360
 take off my feet and I said I'm better 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.309
 and I will get ahead of this not the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.989
 true until they said until 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.370
 the results came out on the screen myself 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.469
 I was going to be calm and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 indispensable if it failed it did not fail 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.429
 I was looking for gold after I 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.989
 I feel very happy I feel motivated to 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.789
 keep growing and getting good 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.300
 results for myself all over the 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.000
 work that I have to keep awake 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.100
 leave for training but I think 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 that also to your work the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.980
 press the work of my coaches 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 my parents who have always supported me 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.550
 and goodbye is always good 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.620
 it was a very strong preparation because 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 I knew that in Mexico it was the competition 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 only and good person and I knew that the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 selective to be very strong but I 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.470
 I've never stopped thinking about what I'm going to 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.300
 do an excellent routine that I'm going to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 do a job the same the same 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.040
 work that I have trained for days 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 and months and I think that is the result 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.560
 I've been six years and seven years or so 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.540
 trampoline practice is of the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.760
 panamericanos de guadalajara-2011 obtained 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 the bronze medal had several 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.370
 international competitions in which 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 I am within 20 30 between 30 a place 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.420
 and every day I'm looking for better 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 results to get to the games like this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 olympics after now I think that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 I'm going to take two days three for 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.440

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.970

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.149
