00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.950
 vllora with sts kings to triple lowered 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.020
 a single bullet that brings us incredible 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.939
 spectacular let's see a repeat 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.160
 with the camera free of like enemies 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.500
 they are put in single file, you know not what 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.570
 do at home guys 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.400
 and in number 9 we're going to do 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.110
 written the horsehair map although that is not 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.480
 precisely what makes line 10 with 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.190
 his falls starts with that triple low 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.460
 does not leave any sheet outdoors 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.140
 well any leads five enemies and 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.820
 not happy with it ends with two more 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.250
 to complete his streak of 7 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 and very attentive to number 8 because we have 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.329
 in male down to ever the logic on sts 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.489
 Top the first enemy is positioned 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 to catch respond to do 2 because 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.059
 kills the first second and third of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.879
 collateral the room does not miss quad 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.500
 and to complete the crisis of five to the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.500
 fifth the sixth by the hairs 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.049
 and in number 7 this week we have 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.729
 in the emission map mode gov ar- 3 a 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.770
 David Mejia that is going to give us some classes 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.540
 of defensive work with the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.270
 sniper in this case barrett 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.250
 caliber 50 here on the flag should in the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.820
 center of this map mission this hall 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.940
 so frantic and so narrow where david 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.670
 Mejia Mejia forgiveness will not let pass 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.740
 no enemy is still there positioned 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.539
 Take out all the advantages of specialist 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.460
 and he realizes that they can outflank 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.020
 because he sees that partner in front 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.030
 and indeed a sniper was coming 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.460
 with very bad intentions less bad that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.590
 that partner saves him there is again that 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.840
 sniper anything david mejia does not let 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 happen to anyone even now they are going to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.409
 put a turret but nothing happens 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.780
 has the whole streak of specialist and 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.929
 finally completes his 13-pound streak 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.929
 enemies 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.870
 and in number 6 we go to the map of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.630
 yemen where renegade 90 sends us a 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.930
 clip with his in 94 where he is going to take out 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 a good swarm the whole streak did not 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.920
 let's cut the whole march of very 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000
 little time we find that he gets into 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.900
 the hot spot to catch them 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 puntillos gets that triple fide follows 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.350
 looking for enemies what interests you is 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.480
 get the streak out as fast as possible 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.209
 that low with the c4 gets seang and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.590
 nario keeps looking for still looking up 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.959
 the stairs are going to get into the house 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 but he finds no enemy and he goes to 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.440
 have to go back to the hot spot already 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.170
 who have taken it the enemies gets 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.170
 in the hot spot kills another enemy 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.520
 take out the wizard and now you know you have the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 advantage of knowing where the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.280
 enemies gets the dogs and finally 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.280
 the very good swarm 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.879
 and at number 5 on the equator of this 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.579
 week we have to barú that in the map of 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.980
 slums weapons game is going to take a 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.890
 spectacular streak and nothing more and nothing 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.340
 less than 11 weapon changes very 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.959
 quickly in just 30 seconds 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.790
 a streak of 11 here in 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.109
 game of weapons is not easy because in addition 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.599
 that you can get out by any 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.790
 site that enemy can have a soul 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.370
 sorry a soul not clear yes a weapon 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.799
 better than yours which increases the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.959
 difficulty but baruque in addition to 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.599
 reflexes and aim has had blood 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.189
 cool to position yourself is to know by 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.489
 Where do they get to know each other a little? 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:26.419
 response and finally get the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.419
 last week is very good streak baruque 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.489
 and in number 4 I expose in situation 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.129
 newton 2025 a barracks taken inside 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.870
 a house and a diamond shotgun already 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.700
 you know what touches more oregano extracts a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.349
 spectacular weather where surely 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.690
 will have spotted the command a bit there 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.610
 we see what is expected in the corner wait 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.870
 to the enemies with good cold blood 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.390
 magnet that kinda to kill that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.819
 sniper we dodged his shots 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.489
 which I read the matrix there we see in the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.290
 corner in the same corner waiting for 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 the enemies recharging their shotgun 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.099
 you have four gets the triple low 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.739
 will not let anyone deactivate that 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.840
 barrack not while more ears are still alive 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.209
 with a shotgun the hands there do not 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.519
 will enter no one follows his side is going to 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.069
 take out a total streak of 15 enemies not 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.620
 it's easy obviously you're going to get all 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.220
 the streak the good ub sad is given that turn 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.959
 very good still looking for enemies is not going 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.539
 to let in even shoots when not 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.820
 no one goes up the stairs relaxes 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.210
 recharge thinks it's going to do what it's going to 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.550
 be his next move and for that mistake 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.800
 deactivates the barracks but more orega not 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.740
 he has finished he has taken out the blackbird 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.970
 wait for him to breathe because this continues 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.590
 kill one who wants to enter the house 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.000
 with a shotgun and had very bad 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.520
 intentions by the way there was thrown to the 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.669
 head and finally this one is over 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.669
 ly 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.440
 and in number 3 silence because we 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.320
 let's search and destroy here in soto 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.960
 modern warfare 3 where x de exter va with 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.540
 Your pp 90 with loaders extended according to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.420
 I see you get into the little house you will find 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.460
 a very close one ends with him with the 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.140
 first victim and not the last one is going to 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.120
 make a full team the six enemies 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.920
 for him alone I stew it myself 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.480
 as clear that if it ends with the second 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.570
 victim over water the party has 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.180
 fucked the streak and attentive to that headshot 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.540
 miraculous has fallen on his back has not 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.670
 I had to like it a lot that ends up with 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.320
 the fourth enemy to dexter has two left 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.660
 to make them the full team and send this 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.580
 clip to the top ends with the fifth gets 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.200
 the predictor looks for searches for strip 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.120
 centex to nothing to see if there is any hit 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.560
 marker some clue to find that 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.140
 sixth enemy that can be in a 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.470
 corner and dexter guess what good 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.470
 dexter 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.830
 and in number 2 we are going to do more 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.739
 search and destroy where rich 901 we 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.919
 brings a spectacular clip in the mode 

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:50.839
 league you already know 4 versus 4 grit has the 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.300
 hunch that the enemies are 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.039
 find in the pump should we not know 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.159
 whether he will accept or not what we know is that 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.259
 is going to roll brown comes in not think 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.059
 twice ends with the first one with a 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.429
 shot to the head is the second 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.929
 and we do not know and without wanting to but it ends with 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.369
 also with the third one is left for 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:09.499
 become the full team and effectively what 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:12.789
 Get full team is very little time 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.789
 clip piece 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.010
 and at the top of the top at number 1 of 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.650
 this week we have on the cargo map 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.170
 search and destroy like that of all the 91 that 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.600
 we see has clear ideas more than 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.360
 clear I would say I was positioned here strip 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.370
 a c4 and the whole team is charged to 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.250
 six rivals in search and destroy with a 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.720
 c4 a full-fledged full team we are going to 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.820
 see please a repeat with the 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.280
 free camera and we see the enemies how 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.040
 they pile up that delusions did not expect that 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.110
 c4 in their heads that would kill them 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.510
 very good and happiness of course 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.980
 champion if you want to participate for the 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.570
 next week you have to send me a 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.580
 private message through youtube with 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.170
 the top issue by attaching the link to 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.440

 I also remember the three are not valid 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.730
 sets nor the competitive play anymore 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.220
