00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.719
 Hello 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 then the chef was not expected but 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.379
 recipe the chef put himself in the kitchen a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.350
 prepare I do not know what I immediately took the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.260
 camera the camera for 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.400
 resume because it is a very good thing 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 said no I have to make the recipe and i am the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 panzerotti we bundles depend a little 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.480
 you like to call them the bundles of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.950
 puff pastry will compose and pancetta 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 very easy I recommend them like 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 aperitif or as simple starter 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 a few tasty ingredients e 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.180
 very good I am promoting the recipe 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.050
 then for this recipe i 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.550
 ingredients are bacri borri an egg 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.469
 a puff pastry oil, salt and pepper 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.580
 these are the ingredients and let's get started 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.820
 immediately with the recipe then in one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470
 add a little oil to the pan 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 I recommend it because anyway 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.369
 bacon and fat and releases already for 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.380
 the fat itself with cold roio 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.700
 so without having had it heated it was 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.990
 also the bacon given 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 in the meantime he started throwing the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.600
 we have pores already 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.310
 then cut the pores in rounds and there 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.310
 add to the pan 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.190
 once all the pores are reached 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.300
 francesca oil and leeks cook them a 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.340
 medium high fire until the pores do not 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.740
 they soften so it's not a good one 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.740
 then ski for a few minutes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.390
 then I forgot to tell you 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 we are always at the beginning of cooking 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.340
 of leeks to add half a glass 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 of water 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.990
 four minutes have passed 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.580
 at this point we reach salt and pepper 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.570
 mix well and cook 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 one more minute 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.920
 then a total of five have passed 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.770
 minutes 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.030
 at this point and then they became well 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.230
 to keep the soft and therefore we hope e 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 let's leave aside at this point 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.780
 take the puff pastry us 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.350
 we use the pastry cutter and make gods 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.350
 circles 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.310
 at this point you do 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.940
 not too many holes with a fork e 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.990
 put some prepared outside and 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.210
 bacon on the disk 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.060
 you feel puff pastry not too much because 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.060
 I'm exploding, you ask halfway 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.550
 lightly crush the edges with the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.220
 fingers and to make a more cute effect 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.310
 take the fork and pass all the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.530
 edge so that it will create an effect 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.070
 in short, a little nicer 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.070
 in this way 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.169
 and there placed on a baking sheet 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.010
 with baking paper and so new to 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.010
 all the others 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 then robe of a man and robert beat 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:05:01.430
 slightly ok at this point go to 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:05.419
 brush our bundles at the end 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.580
 we called you the bundles with 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.240
 the egg so that with cooking 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.460
 will create a golden surface between 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.530
 the other with the remainder of the correct 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.780
 of puff pastry we made some 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:26.660
 herons and we have them abortions in the sesia mo 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:29.360
 that even those are very good 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.990
 once brushed with place we supply to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.990
 200 degrees and minutes for ethical later 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.169
 then twenty minutes passed at 200 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:46.490
 the results are ready and this is the result 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.500
 you can see that the surface is beautiful 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.320
 golden then from this you can 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.590
 recognize that they are clearly ready 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.479
 it depends a lot on your oven then 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.220
 this is the end result has the 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.900
 put in a dish just with some 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.470
 leek decorations e 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.960
 nothing to the recipe in my opinion 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.770
 spectacular as a beautiful aperitif 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.410
 I am very hearty or a starter 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.639
 very expensive as you saw simple 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.190
 to do 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.919
 so I hope nothing in the recipe 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.660
 both liked and if home sign up at 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.350
