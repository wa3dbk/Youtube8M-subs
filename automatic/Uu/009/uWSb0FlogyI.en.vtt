00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.569
 contents nor holidays and common return

 a lot of things to tell perez ares has also happened nothing of what 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:15.690
 way summer 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.869
 and there is one in particular that I liked very much that has been the muskilda of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.800
 milan in which I have seen one thing that I liked especially and is that I 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.300
 I want to do paperwork for cheaper 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.249
 specifically it has been seen together 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.390
 in this way with a quarter emaná jersey there were made of wool with beads 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 Cooked enter vertical rockers 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.690
 Well, I'm going to do something similar 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.240
 but so economical that beatriz high a woolen sweater this 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
 case is going to be a jacket 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 takeoff 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.330
 that more than 80 as beatriz halak thread to sew the accounts 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.670
 This space 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 maybe part cuéllar is that it is served at the gala is bought on Tuesday and I do not know 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.530
 what is here barak that the performances to customize that is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 I was hoping to teach good in Hidalgo for the temperatures of now a 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.060
 little bit colder 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.080
 It was not suitable to do other kinds of events with the occasional wool that was made 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.050
 Females but this is not one of the best typical posters 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.320
 and with him this cessation 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 in a tone similar to the other 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.720
 Well, it's a very simple process 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.630
 the only thing or that has more work then is that you have to own one by one and you 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.900
 it takes a little longer then the accounts and to put them in stripes 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.140
 vertical 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.130
 from above, more or less 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 to this instance 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.740
 passed the process is very simple but we will finish a little bit not doing it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.250
 because you have to cook one by one so I recommend the same thing for a while 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.030
 have 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.730
 enough free time we take the uefa with the thread and catch / account then 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.729
 we have to put the sheet through the holes 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.330
 and give a couple of 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 of laps 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 in doing so 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.619
 when we have it, they are launched with it and not only things are left 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 the exciting but the little hole that we have a couple of laps 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.289
 two 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.649
 steptoe we give another turn more respect life 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.119
 the spokesman of iu 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.439
 we make some noises 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.429
 if we cut theirs 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.679
 we turn the little pearl so it does not look 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.849
 and this is the result that has to be left 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.749
 in vertical stripes 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.669
 Well, certain of mosquito-style jacket as vaise put 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.299
 little pearls crier in what consists in separating enough losses 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.940
 make enough prazas 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.520
 so that it is in much more loaded jacket for example with a belt 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.099
 for missing a lot of pain 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.379
 blind while at this time the position 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.159
 barea separate percent a little puncture of the facts of nowhere 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.659
 and then from behind 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.849
 that also in the opposite also to vertical lines also to expose 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.299
 by the bands or by the story that already common 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.160
 so it transforms from customizing that 6 is coauthor tunisia 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.760
 I will enter and stephen the appearances that has quite mixe quite funny 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.990
 chosen one and intoning the pom-poms with the yellow 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.099
 and hopes to have the support of the popular 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.709
 I'm going to put 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.419
 is enough to separate them because if it is not going to be 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.229
 Heavily loaded 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.770
 after this fact 10 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.930
 they were going to stay 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.930
 thus 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.300
 and to dream as the pompoms has done to the cardboard, but it has 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.449
 done with the rules is very easy I teach you tennis with these two fingers those of 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.189
 root 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 you feel country to spend 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.789
 with a little open 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.650
 when you see that you have real estate short wool is a slightly long stroke 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 and you pass it through your fingers 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.680
 zapeta is good 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 after a couple of laps 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.189
 leave is a little bit to make a knot 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.939
 when you have it out there is only 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.039
 cut the pieces of 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.039
 of lama with scissors 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.139
 what this fact is a bit 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.900
 and has had this coupon 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.990
 Now it's worth to sew the 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.619
 It is very simple 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.619
 take it compares what they put it stand up disk be it 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.089
 again 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.089
 abuja emilio and with six inside 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.960
 when I always take 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960
 in the middle thread that collects all the long 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 coast has 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.809
 hans dissimulation 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.330
 and tennis cossío 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.060
 for failure also determined the one that was made to companies as a species 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.900
 put only the front 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.350
 in the back the setting in the world or in the bad that good she 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.620
 as your stumble you want so good as nothing and sometimes part and the certainty is 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.969
 that this sale is made is that you have a closet dead with laughter 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:20.699
 and it's cheap so the network I hope you're in positions is that in your 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:21.360
 third parties 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.360
 i is that the opposition parties nothing more 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:27.069
 without you
