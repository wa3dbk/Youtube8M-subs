00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.149
 Cougar has greater capacity and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.110
 White helicopter has lower capacity 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.580
 however, they are used for operations 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 necessary at all times and in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 different places for example the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.790
 White helicopter is received by half 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 of the agreements of the Merida initiative 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.660
 and it is used both to support the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.360
 civil population in cases and areas of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.010
 disaster to do operations of 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.380
 close air support when fighting 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.250
 against organized crime 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.230

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.089
 respect to the president of the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.339
 republic and certainly an excellent 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.069
 control over the equipment is called that 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.140
 maneuver captain robert are doing 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:45.329
 young and then make a bow 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.580
 towards the front as a demonstration of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.620
 respect and control 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.720
 this is the greeting to the president of the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 republic from the helicopter of the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.239
 helicopters from the secretariats of 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.680
 defense and marine so we have been 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.270
 designed that is the intention we can 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 make a show of respect for the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.210
 Mr. President and control of the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 aircraft 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 now right now we are observing how 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.750
 throw a quick rope where 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.420
 descends the staff that has a 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.670
 mission to accomplish in the marina this 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.900
 type of operations is done to 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350
 support the forces that are 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.520
 fighting the staff that has to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.369
 descend to support the population 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.140
 civil and even it is done to do 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.420
 boardings at sea when a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.170
 vessel is stopped 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.020
 captain pardon major tino with some 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.360
 characteristics that the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.700
 mate of the army is that the two 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.950
 helicopters can be designated as 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.630
 multipurpose helicopters have a 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.170
 great versatility to be employed 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.330
 as ambulances cargo transportation 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.700
 they have many attachments and how is the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.350
 exterior hook for rescue 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.580
 and they can also use what are the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.590
 bambi bucket for the extinction of 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.200
 fires the two helicopters are from 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.000
 first generation and have all the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.440
 most modern equipment that you are employing in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.710
 all the forces in the world what 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.229
 capacity have these helicopters the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.049
 ability of the cougar helicopter is for 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.480
 29 members and the ability to 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.030
 helicopter h-60 is for 13 crew 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 can be used as helicopters 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.250
 of affirmative load can be removed 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.129
 the seats and can be employed as 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.470
 cargo helicopters the two can 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.360
 load approximately 5 tons 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 right now we are seeing the position of 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.390
 the two helicopters on the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.390
 platforms that were built in the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.769
 bridge this makes it gives you more 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 benefits still to the bridge since it 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.319
 can use as helipads in a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.019
 required case to children is something 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.870
 spectacular the theme of the helicopter in 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.900
 how many years does a man take a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.579
 woman to study to make a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.920
 military career and being able to be in charge 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.140
 of a helicopter these currently 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.310
 I say to encourage children older not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.410
 oh yes 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.950
 school currently air in this 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.720
 The six-year administration extended the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.239
 pilot aviator in order that 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.859
 come out with the bachelor level one 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.780
 of the requirements is obviously to have the 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.480
 finished high school 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.150
 and have the most specific requirement of 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.709
 the stature that would be about 65 the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.980
 because of the height is because the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.530
 aircraft are of other nationalities 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.090
 where they are designed for people from 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.489
 a little taller ergonomics 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.410
 of the cabins do not allow people 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.600
 of shorter stature may be able to 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.310
 manipulate the controls completely 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.500
 then after his baccalaureate 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.110
 they can access the air school 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.060
 after four years they graduate as 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.180
 second lieutenant pilots in 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.890
 aircraft fixed wing material 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.630
 subsequently they are transferred or 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.760
 assigned to rotating wing units 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.170
 where with the specific course of the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.269
 aircraft become pilots of 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.010
 helicopters and it's the same case in the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.290
 secretariat of marine captain mandala 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.569
 for the Navy which 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.760
 want to be pilot aviator of the army of 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.459
 Mexico needs to enter the heroic 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.810
 naval school and from there request 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.850
 enter the aviation school where 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.910
 You can choose between the wing race 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.340
 fixed and mobile wing any of those from 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.139
 the two cases in the vision school 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.090
 based in the lower peace southern california 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.769
 you get an excellent training 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.449
 general that allows them to operate with 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.729
 of the aircraft of the armada de mexico 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.770
 and when they become integrated into the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.449
 squads or units where they go to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.909
 perform their services are given a 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.800
 extra training very 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.020
 specialized for the aircraft that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.659
 touches operate that autonomy has a 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.539
 helicopter of this size in the case 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:44.599
 of playing that 725 has a range of 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.669
 four and a half hours in 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.680
 the case of pothole 60 has 2 hours 20 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 this autonomy sometimes there is reality 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.340
 greater is to say where does one come with a 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.979
 helicopter that has a range of 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.870
 four hours if we start from the zocalo 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.300
 where as far as we can travel with that 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.849
 autonomy the helicopters have the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:10.150
 played at a speed of 150 knots 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:10.150
 Approximately 300 kilometers per hour 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.250
 we would talk about having a radio 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.889
 action about 900 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.210
 kilometers well colonel you evicted 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.300
 that we are seeing now this we can 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.120
 observe that a 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.730
 Tractor truck with a low camera 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.400
 transports to the socket board 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.400
 a screen so that the people can 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.650
 observe in more detail some 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.250
 phases of our parade column 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.250
 its development 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.949
 the graduate general of diploma 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:44.680

 since independence from mexico and we open 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.879
 with these planes the biggest tinoco 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.949
 talk about what they are doing and what 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.949
 type of aircraft are we are seeing the 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:08.020
 pilatus pc-7 aircraft that are used to 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.699
 recognition operations or 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.020
 interception and especially as 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.599
 coaches at the military school already 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.340
 version the maneuver they performed was 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.580
 a fleur de lis 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.860
 with smoke indicators with the three 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.229
 colors of the flag 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.340
 what kind of plane did he tell us is a 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:30.319
 helicopter pc-7 turbojet engine that 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.599
 helicopter is plane forgiveness is an airplane 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.500
 fish and there is a pc-7 plane that is 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.500
 they employ myth level schools
