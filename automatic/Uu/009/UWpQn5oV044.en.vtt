00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 welcome together and also 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 hello to all of us out there in the stadium 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.969
 must vacate the off watch for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 press conference after today 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.960
 The third league plays the game 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 between arminia bielefeld and in it 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.720
 ended 4 0 in front of 12,000 87 spectators alongside 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 me the two chine trainers christian 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 goat and norbert meier and as always 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.539
 the guest has the word first with us 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.110
 christian goat will 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.920
 thank you hello from my side 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.200
 luck has arminia bielefeld think so 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.250
 today was absolutely earned here 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 have previously said that we are 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.930
 certainly not with arminia Bielefeld 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.730
 they can stand upright there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250
 above 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 nonetheless, wanted to try 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.460
 to take advantage of our opportunities but I believe 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 both team has in terms of today 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.010
 cleverness robustness keep the tackle 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.450
 especially the first half 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.380
 seen how to do it in the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.330
 league to indeed be able to get what the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.450
 was much better on tuesday today 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.180
 which is not so good for us in the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.040
 cards that we got so early in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.890
 advised 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.890
 but I think we know what they are 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.530
 are always so we are with these 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 have to deal with things 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.259
 many young players with us in the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 Team then maybe in 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.770
 such a stadion piece for 13 of the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.729
 again from the robustness of the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 Team is no surprise 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.970
 is not nice that we lost 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.740
 But you can come to many conclusions 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 you can analyze and analyze many 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.939
 then is his mouth and wipe 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.630
 with whom they may measure up 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.890
 our eye level are dankeschön 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.360
 missing christian goat then i may 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.680
 our head coach norbert meier 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.680
 to offer his statement to the game 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.069
 23 seconds have and still full 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.630
 I think it was a deserved victory 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.670
 today 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.790
 we started focusing around 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.860
 presented two goals and thus the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.360
 play already in our direction 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.420
 can then have in the middle of the first 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.200
 halfway through a phase where we had the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 Let hachinger play where we only 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.300
 reacted but no longer acted 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.760
 and then you could see that too 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.640
 this is a young team though 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.530
 footballing absolute quality has arrived 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.760
 Then there were two good options for 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.130
 haching god thank you then we have 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.920
 just before half-time shoppers through the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.290
 13 new ones follow 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.989
 in the second half has the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.720
 team that has more managed there 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.190
 i understand a little bit for that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.920
 We have more serious games in front of the chest 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.920
 have and nice that we still have the fourth 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.209
 could close shortly before closing and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.459
 that also kuhn from the bi ten times 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.360

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.380
 here in bielefeld that was important to the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.750
 There was actually a game even 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.519
 Thank you very much 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.200
 Thank you, there are always the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.060
 opportunity for you and ask for it 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.959
 to ask both coaches how to get around 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.959
 ask for the hand signal 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.570
