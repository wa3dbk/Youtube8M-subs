00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of course going forward and to the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.250 
of course going forward and to the
second<00:00:28.349> part<00:00:28.439> why<00:00:28.650> didn't<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> attack<00:00:29.220> Lewis

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
second part why didn't I attack Lewis

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.749 
second part why didn't I attack Lewis
iris<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.470> also<00:00:31.769> understand<00:00:32.309> why<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.640> asking

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
iris I also understand why you're asking

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.280 
iris I also understand why you're asking
that<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.420> may<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.020> easy<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that and it may be not so easy to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.639 
that and it may be not so easy to
understand<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:34.980> outside<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:36.329> clear<00:00:36.649> but

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
understand from outside that's clear but

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
understand from outside that's clear but
the<00:00:37.800> reason<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.489> did<00:00:38.969> try<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> attack<00:00:39.600> him<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the reason is I did try to attack him in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
the reason is I did try to attack him in
the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:40.110> thing<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.129> didn't<00:00:41.340> work

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the first thing and it just didn't work

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760 
the first thing and it just didn't work
all<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> did<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.059> destroy<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.690> tires<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
all I did was destroy my tires so in the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
all I did was destroy my tires so in the
second<00:00:44.129> stint<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.820> no<00:00:44.969> point<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.570> try

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
second stint there was no point to try

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
second stint there was no point to try
and<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.989> again<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.190> time

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and do that again because this time

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
and do that again because this time
there<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.579> metal<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.090> behind<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there was metal right behind and it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
there was metal right behind and it
would<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.590> risked<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.219> second<00:00:50.610> place

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
would have really risked my second place

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.979 
would have really risked my second place
if<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.090> would<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.270> tried<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
if I would have tried that because I

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.119 
if I would have tried that because I
just<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.350> destroyed<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> tire<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just would have destroyed the tire is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
just would have destroyed the tire is
completely<00:00:53.219> again<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.270> Vettel<00:00:54.870> could<00:00:55.020> have

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
completely again and Vettel could have

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
completely again and Vettel could have
had<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.440> good<00:00:55.620> shot<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.860> overtaking<00:00:56.430> me

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
had a really good shot at overtaking me

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.160 
had a really good shot at overtaking me
and<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:57.120> only<00:00:57.270> chance<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> win<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> race

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and my only chance to win the race

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
and my only chance to win the race
anyways<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> fight<00:00:59.190> Lewis<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> try<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
anyways or to fight Lewis or to try and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
anyways or to fight Lewis or to try and
overtake<00:01:00.510> him<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> end

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
overtake him would have come at the end

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.139 
overtake him would have come at the end
of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> race<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> was

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of the race and so that's what I was

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.929 
of the race and so that's what I was
building<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:04.500> smoothly<00:01:05.040> well<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
building up to it at smoothly well it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.170 
building up to it at smoothly well it
would<00:01:06.060> definitely<00:01:06.180> intense<00:01:06.750> after<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> race

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
would definitely intense after the race

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
would definitely intense after the race
but<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.299> had<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.780> sit<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.860> good

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
