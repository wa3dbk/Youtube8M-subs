 code hold lax blocked side 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670
 transmission then davis and the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.040

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.430
 start by reinstalling bobby bucket 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800

 partially installed your axis side 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.750
 transmission in order to have enough room 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.300
 for a hippie style in a way of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.300
 bearing opposite side to the transmission 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.100
 will install bobby in the path of 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.750
 bearing opposite side to the transmission 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.370

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:53.620
 pay attention to what the parties in 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:55.540

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.640
 set your hub and if your code has 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.670

 if there is play, it will take the relay 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.090
 also check that it turns freely if 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.470
 they do not rotate freely 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.290
