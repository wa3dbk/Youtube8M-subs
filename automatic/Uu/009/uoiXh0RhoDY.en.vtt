00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.259
 wc operating system 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.210
 mechanics that's the reservoir of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.830
 dirty water retention so by the way 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.940
 how is it going this tank a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.410
 Once it's full, we'll start with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.150
 the end is easier because we 're going 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 start with the simplest there is a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 tube down that goes to a conch that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.029
 stand out there to go to sea water 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.719
 good bah that's how it happens so 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.930
 when you want to empty the tank is big 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.730
 operate this hand pump and its share 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.030
 directly to the sea so that's his 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 independent system I would say dump 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 now the toilets they have downstairs it is 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 see that big tubes that he's going to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 go by that we are not going very well but 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.390
 you make it very simple and there the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.960
 tube and we can see he's going out dollar 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 this is this evacuation tube of toilets 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 either he goes to the right ie 'ok I 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.939
 goes up and it gets into the tank of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 retention 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:26.009
 either he goes left there on the left and there he 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 go directly into his evacuation 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.329
 clean in the marine environment it remains more 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.220
 only one tube is that one 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.400
 Well, it's a Cuban che 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.670
 certainly will overflow 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.159
 swing that to the sea so he's there so 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.859
 in case of overflow bim 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.049
 without voice it to the sea and of course 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:54.140
 here there is also a tube that is connected 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.969
 at the top of the screen is what you eat is 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.619
 certainly it's either to empty 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.880
 manually the pump is for the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.880
 clean by filling with water
