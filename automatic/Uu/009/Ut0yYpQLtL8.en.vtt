00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
which I spent ten bucks on I didn't even

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.120 
which I spent ten bucks on I didn't even
know<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.700> came<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:32.010> gamecube<00:03:33.010> i

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
know that this came out for gamecube i

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.590 
know that this came out for gamecube i
thought<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.370> was<00:03:33.459> only<00:03:33.549> like<00:03:33.790> PlayStation<00:03:34.239> 2

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
thought it was only like PlayStation 2

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.900 
thought it was only like PlayStation 2
and<00:03:34.630> Xbox<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.040> guess<00:03:36.160> that's<00:03:36.310> pretty<00:03:36.670> cool

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
and Xbox so I guess that's pretty cool

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.819 
and Xbox so I guess that's pretty cool
and<00:03:37.890> Shadow<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.010> Hedgehog<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:41.079> I'm

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829
