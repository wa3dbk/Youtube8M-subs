00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 we 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.610
 networks 34 55 speaks to you today is here 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.419
 finally up with a video to beat the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.009
 4 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.849
 the game that is taking me a lot that 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.849
 I love it 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 this is the marbles that looked like langa 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.900
 a map that I think is the best for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.859
 to use the sniper because there are many 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 open spaces and sayings on where to go 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.020
 I must say that obviously it is necessary but not 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.620
 you have to expose yourself too much then sniper 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.089
 because it is not as domestic helpers who must 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 he could also leave if he is good at 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.240
 do here discover 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.690
 you could afford 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.610
 throw in the drama here no purpose here are 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.800
 really hard to do 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.680
 note the distance must be recalculated 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 because even if you are too far away from the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.080
 Enemy you really risk doing fake 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 so many movies that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.250
 take me five months from distance 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.410
 long calculate the trajectory of the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 bullet of the difficult 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.350
 as you have seen before perhaps one thing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 which also gives a little more annoyance than i 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.110
 bullets arrive after that is if me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 I shoot an enemy and he shoots 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.640
 at the same time we catch that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.790
 we can snipe each other but anyway 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.620
 this thing maybe I thought at first 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.330
 with a negative thing however at the end one 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.710
 What more real, then it is another thing I 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.690
 I'm looking for I'll do other games where 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.550
 I will try to block others ct 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.220
 because of having something unbearable 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.180
 now I'm using the second sniper 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.390
 unlockable but really too many but each 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 time is as you see 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.800
 unless it's an employee for me 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.760
 test one thing 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:10.600
 acer friends kill you time 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:15.890
 killed like carletti has been for some time 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:20.030
 then be careful even maybe not 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.310
 expose yourself too much because I always keep myself 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.060
 on the roofs so as to watch 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.920
 a little the whole map is to take them though a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.460
 For snipers if they are not 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.460
 above you they are at the bottom of the map and 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.040
 this is unfortunately what what 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.860
 is on battlefield but according to me before or 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:51.660
 then it's not like ropes that campers are 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.660
 16 campera makes decisions is not so 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 well anyway the part of the it marker 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.590
 I could also do good deeds 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.560
 fellows missed the years in a row 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.480
 obviously they were not lacking but as you have 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.700
 now that I was wrong because it was wrong 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.700
 confront his friend and I did not return 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.909
 account that there were others for example 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.269
 four enemies all right was 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.939
 concentrated on that age here and beyond 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.639
 what there will be three others all 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.170
 which I think less I think it aimed not 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:32.970
 they stopped and looked at the roof 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.970
 and therefore I will give the only one to give boys 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.930
 I will surely end it on 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:44.180
 fight even not only with snipers 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.180
 also of the three weapons surely 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.200
 here I hope you are taking up so far 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.990
 He liked or sato cut some 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.090
 share to make it less boring because 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.110
 every time it was necessary to arrive from 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.100
 part of the enemy was something that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.230
 in any case , his time was needed 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.090
 I am just in the middle of the map and 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.040
 always tried to change year with the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.860
 gun because I do not understand that safe 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.050
 meanwhile, here I have done trademark air 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.280
 different to three different people 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.890
 the third sleeves here it is the most 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.860
 endure it all here the film is missing 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.560
 but we may have to unlock the three 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.380
 snipers from the boys the video cannes is 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.220
 come to an end 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.180
 if you liked put it I like it 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.380
 comment and sign up and I 'll do it 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:51.040
 will be other videos and therefore nothing 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.040
 kids hello guys
