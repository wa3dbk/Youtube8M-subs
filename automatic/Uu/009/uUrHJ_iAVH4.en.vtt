00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
very logical approach to take he then

backwards compatibility feature of
consoles<00:01:55.979> he<00:01:56.579> said<00:01:56.820> quote<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.540> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
consoles he said quote we have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
consoles he said quote we have
experience<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> backwards<00:01:58.890> compatibility

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
experience of backwards compatibility

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
experience of backwards compatibility
the<00:01:59.850> earliest<00:02:00.360> ps3<00:02:00.869> model<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.560> backwards

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the earliest ps3 model was backwards

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.039 
the earliest ps3 model was backwards
compatible<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.520> ps2<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> much

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
compatible with ps2 and it is a much

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.380 
compatible with ps2 and it is a much
requested<00:02:04.290> feature<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.579> actually<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.149> not

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
requested feature but actually it's not

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.660 
requested feature but actually it's not
so<00:02:06.450> greatly<00:02:06.930> used<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.740> balance<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.340> happy

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so greatly used on balance we are happy

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.040 
so greatly used on balance we are happy
with<00:02:08.759> our<00:02:08.940> approach<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:09.720> wish<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
with our approach and we don't wish to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.619 
with our approach and we don't wish to
be<00:02:10.080> defensive<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.830> at<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
be defensive about it at all but as I

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
be defensive about it at all but as I
say<00:02:12.870> both

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
say both

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.369 
say both
approaches<00:02:14.099> are<00:02:14.280> legitimate<00:02:15.049> now<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.110> thing

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
approaches are legitimate now the thing

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.860 
approaches are legitimate now the thing
is<00:02:16.409> I<00:02:16.950> don't<00:02:17.610> agree<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.299> it's<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.599> going<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
is I don't agree that it's not going to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.170 
is I don't agree that it's not going to
be<00:02:18.959> much<00:02:19.170> used<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.860> all<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.519> reaction<00:02:21.000> from

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
be much used at all the reaction from

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
be much used at all the reaction from
this<00:02:21.420> has<00:02:21.629> been<00:02:21.810> huge<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.829> be<00:02:22.920> honest<00:02:23.129> my

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
this has been huge and to be honest my

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
this has been huge and to be honest my
reaction<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.879> holy<00:02:24.239> crap<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.079> is<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> huge

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
reaction was holy crap that is a huge

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.229 
reaction was holy crap that is a huge
move<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.340> there's<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.849> link<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
move and there's a link in the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.880 
move and there's a link in the

description below this video which
basically<00:02:29.220> says<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.090> bit<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.329> about

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
basically says a little bit about about

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.869 
basically says a little bit about about
how<00:02:30.959> backwards<00:02:31.439> compatibility<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.730> course

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
how backwards compatibility is of course

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.910 
how backwards compatibility is of course
here<00:02:33.269> for<00:02:33.599> those<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.019> preview<00:02:34.409> program<00:02:34.590> or

one because of the lack of backwards

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
compatibility it is still a large number

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.640 
compatibility it is still a large number
of<00:03:15.450> people<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> thing<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.379> lot<00:03:16.500> of

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
this voting system is a thing to build

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.589 
this voting system is a thing to build
before<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.489> started<00:03:20.760> researching<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
before I started researching for this

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.379 
before I started researching for this
particular<00:03:21.810> video<00:03:22.230> neither<00:03:22.949> did<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.760> just

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
particular video neither did I so just

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.879 
particular video neither did I so just
thought<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> know<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:25.019> I'll<00:03:25.290> pop<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.799> in

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
thought you know what I'll pop it in

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.069 
thought you know what I'll pop it in
there<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.400> guys<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.879> spread<00:03:27.449> the<00:03:27.599> word<00:03:27.780> and

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
there you guys can spread the word and

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.080 
there you guys can spread the word and
we<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.859> true<00:03:29.159> idea<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.549> how<00:03:29.790> much

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
we can get a true idea of how much

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.849 
we can get a true idea of how much
interest<00:03:30.540> there<00:03:30.720> actually<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.230> i<00:03:31.260> mean<00:03:31.409> if<00:03:31.680> so

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
interest there actually is i mean if so

fallout<00:03:48.540> 3<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.500> still<00:03:49.650> 12,000<00:03:50.400> people<00:03:50.549> and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
fallout 3 it's still 12,000 people and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.399 
fallout 3 it's still 12,000 people and
yes<00:03:51.299> it's<00:03:51.479> small<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.840> comparison<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
yes it's small in comparison to the

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.599 
yes it's small in comparison to the
number<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.650> people<00:03:52.799> who<00:03:52.919> play<00:03:53.129> it<00:03:53.190> one<00:03:53.519> or

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
number of people who play it one or

number of people who play it one or
whatever<00:03:53.819> it's<00:03:54.449> still<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.440> small<00:03:55.739> number

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
whatever it's still not a small number

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.680 
whatever it's still not a small number
so<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> kind<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.849> have<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.060> disagree<00:03:57.329> which<00:03:57.569> in
