00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
is done in two stages we're going to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
is done in two stages we're going to
press<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.849> fold<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:31.850> centimetre<00:00:32.870> all<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
press and fold one centimetre all the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.639 
press and fold one centimetre all the
way<00:00:34.290> around<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.730> stitch<00:00:36.320> really<00:00:37.320> close

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
way around and then stitch really close

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.209 
way around and then stitch really close
that's<00:00:38.129> step<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.760> step<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:40.040> we're<00:00:41.040> then

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that's step one step two we're then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.990 
that's step one step two we're then
going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> cut<00:00:42.800> right<00:00:43.800> next<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> stitching

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
going to cut right next to the stitching

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.190 
going to cut right next to the stitching
and<00:00:45.770> press<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.129> second<00:00:47.820> very<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.840> tiny

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and press up a second very very tiny

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.010 
and press up a second very very tiny
narrow<00:00:49.469> fold<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> stitch<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> same

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
narrow fold and stitch that on the same

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.360 
narrow fold and stitch that on the same
spot<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.879> pressing<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:57.590> one<00:00:58.590> centimetre

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
spot so I'm pressing in one centimetre

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.060 
spot so I'm pressing in one centimetre
fold

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.730 

all<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.430> way<00:01:06.549> around<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.270> that's<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.350> one

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
all the way around so that's a one

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.850 
all the way around so that's a one
centimeter<00:01:09.369> hem<00:01:09.880> pressed<00:01:10.810> I'm<00:01:11.110> now<00:01:11.320> going<00:01:11.560> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
centimeter hem pressed I'm now going to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.630 
centimeter hem pressed I'm now going to
take<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.880> Machine<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.509> so<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.640> want

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
take this to the Machine and so I want

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.460 
take this to the Machine and so I want
to<00:01:15.729> get<00:01:15.970> my<00:01:16.090> stitching<00:01:16.570> as<00:01:16.689> close<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.350> this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
to get my stitching as close to this

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.820 
to get my stitching as close to this
outside<00:01:18.130> fold<00:01:18.610> as<00:01:18.970> possible<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:20.200> may<00:01:20.380> find<00:01:20.649> it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
outside fold as possible you may find it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.010 
outside fold as possible you may find it
easier<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.220> use<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.640> zipper<00:01:22.119> foot<00:01:22.390> I'm<00:01:22.720> just

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
easier to use a zipper foot I'm just

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.380 
easier to use a zipper foot I'm just
using<00:01:23.229> one<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.250> little<00:01:24.490> markers<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.240> the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
using one of the little markers on the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:34.660 
using one of the little markers on the
top<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.720> my<00:01:25.810> bobbin<00:01:26.170> cover

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.450 

you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.950 

so<00:01:40.060> I'm<00:01:40.150> stitching

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.690 

really<00:01:43.229> close<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.890> outside<00:01:44.690> edge<00:01:46.549> if<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
really close to this outside edge if you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
really close to this outside edge if you
have<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.270> side<00:01:49.220> needle<00:01:50.220> position<00:01:50.760> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
have a right side needle position you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
have a right side needle position you
can<00:01:51.210> make<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.479> easier<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:51.960> moving<00:01:52.229> your

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
can make this easier by moving your

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.890 
can make this easier by moving your
needle<00:01:52.830> position<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.390> nice

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
needle position so I'm just going nice

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.080 
needle position so I'm just going nice
and<00:01:55.229> slowly<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.550> curve<00:01:56.790> becomes

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and slowly and if the curve becomes

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.430 
and slowly and if the curve becomes
quite<00:01:57.600> steep<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.619> stop<00:02:00.290> bring<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
quite steep you can just stop bring the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.190 
quite steep you can just stop bring the
needle<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:03.090> half<00:02:03.420> raise<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> foot

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
needle in and just half raise the foot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.970 
needle in and just half raise the foot
and<00:02:04.500> readjust<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.280> angle<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> curve<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and readjust the angle of the curve you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.949 
and readjust the angle of the curve you
can<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.280> my<00:02:14.430> stitching<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.690> really

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
can see my stitching is really really

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.710 
can see my stitching is really really
close<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.800> outside<00:02:17.100> edge<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> next

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
close to this outside edge and the next

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.100 
close to this outside edge and the next
stage<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.560> trim<00:02:19.830> off<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.640> excess

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
stage is just to trim off this excess

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.009 
stage is just to trim off this excess
right<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> stitching<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.450> step<00:02:24.810> number

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
right up to the stitching so step number

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.449 
right up to the stitching so step number
two<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.620> take<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.769> really<00:02:29.130> sharp

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
two I'm going to take a really sharp

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.610 
two I'm going to take a really sharp
pair<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.820> scissors<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.590> need<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.040> trim<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
pair of scissors and I need to trim the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970 
pair of scissors and I need to trim the
seam<00:02:34.980> allowance<00:02:35.489> very<00:02:35.940> very<00:02:36.780> close<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
seam allowance very very close to the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.809 
seam allowance very very close to the
stitching<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.959> see<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.670> I've

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
stitching so you can see that I've

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.600 
stitching so you can see that I've
trimmed<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.940> smallest<00:02:45.720> fraction<00:02:46.709> right<00:02:47.070> next

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
trimmed the smallest fraction right next

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.990 
trimmed the smallest fraction right next
to<00:02:47.790> my<00:02:48.150> stitching<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.250> rolling<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to my stitching so I'm just rolling this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870 
to my stitching so I'm just rolling this
so<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> teeniest<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.310> little<00:02:53.610> narrow

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
so it's the teeniest of little narrow

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.600 
so it's the teeniest of little narrow
hems<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:55.220> then<00:02:56.220> pressing<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> into<00:02:57.180> position

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
hems and then pressing it into position

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.090 
hems and then pressing it into position
onto<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> wrong<00:02:59.880> side<00:03:00.239> too<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.530> second

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
onto the wrong side too so the second

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.310 
onto the wrong side too so the second
row<00:03:02.489> I've<00:03:02.850> got<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> pin<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.049> get<00:03:04.170> started

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
row I've got a pin just to get started

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:17.170 
row I've got a pin just to get started
and<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:06.049> anchor<00:03:11.930> increased<00:03:12.930> itching

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.410 

just<00:03:18.049> either<00:03:18.319> hitting<00:03:19.010> my<00:03:19.159> stitching<00:03:19.730> or

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
just either hitting my stitching or

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.069 
just either hitting my stitching or
going<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.219> this<00:03:22.549> side<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.329> again<00:03:23.659> nice

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
going just to this side and again nice

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.330 
going just to this side and again nice
and<00:03:24.109> slowly

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.460 

and<00:03:28.819> allowing<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.270> fabric<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.870> follow<00:03:30.230> its

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
and allowing the fabric to follow its

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.220 
and allowing the fabric to follow its
curve

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.390 

from<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.069> wrong<00:03:34.310> side<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:36.050> two<00:03:36.650> rows<00:03:37.160> of

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
from the wrong side I have two rows of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180 
from the wrong side I have two rows of
stitching<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.810> from<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> right<00:03:39.379> side<00:03:39.680> we<00:03:40.160> are

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
stitching but from the right side we are

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.430 
stitching but from the right side we are
only<00:03:40.430> going<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.879> see<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.150> rows<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.019> often<00:03:42.319> it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
only going to see one rows and often it

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.500 
only going to see one rows and often it
becomes<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.830> bit<00:03:42.950> fluted<00:03:43.580> after<00:03:44.090> we've<00:03:44.209> pin

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
becomes a bit fluted after we've pin

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.949 
becomes a bit fluted after we've pin
hemmed<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.040> very<00:03:46.310> last<00:03:46.610> step<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.900> just

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
hemmed it so the very last step is just

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.410 
hemmed it so the very last step is just
to<00:03:48.349> take<00:03:48.620> our<00:03:48.830> iron<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.560> press<00:03:51.560> into<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:53.180> hem

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
to take our iron and press into the hem

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.500 
to take our iron and press into the hem
and<00:03:53.660> just<00:03:53.900> sort<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.170> shrink<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.150> smooth<00:03:56.150> that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
and just sort of shrink and smooth that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.570 
and just sort of shrink and smooth that
hem<00:03:56.870> flat<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.530> iron<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.190> I'm<00:03:58.280> coming

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
hem flat with the iron so I'm coming

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.780 
hem flat with the iron so I'm coming
from<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.910> garment<00:03:59.150> towards<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> hem<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:01.160> you

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
from the garment towards the hem and you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.789 
from the garment towards the hem and you
can<00:04:01.940> see<00:04:02.090> now<00:04:02.239> I've<00:04:02.360> got<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.599> really<00:04:02.930> nice<00:04:03.290> curve

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
can see now I've got a really nice curve

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.769 
can see now I've got a really nice curve
and<00:04:04.129> all<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.910> fleeting<00:04:05.239> has<00:04:05.900> just<00:04:06.230> vanished
