00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
ever not sure if they're done which they

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820 
ever not sure if they're done which they
just<00:02:28.880> look<00:02:29.060> beautiful<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.440> do<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> fork

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
just look beautiful you can do the fork

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.970 
just look beautiful you can do the fork
test<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.720> inserts<00:02:33.140> easily<00:02:33.560> now

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
test so if it just inserts easily now

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.350 
test so if it just inserts easily now
