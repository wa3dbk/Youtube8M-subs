00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
musically that's that's a pretty

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.450 
musically that's that's a pretty
complicated<00:00:23.310> way<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> note<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:26.010> make

complicated way to make a note and make

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:39.190 
complicated way to make a note and make
it<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> same<00:00:26.970> way<00:00:27.180> more<00:00:27.480> than<00:00:27.630> once<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> row

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.770 

so<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.590> doing<00:00:40.730> instead<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.969> pushing

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so what you're doing instead of pushing

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
so what you're doing instead of pushing
down<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:44.010> against<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> fretboard<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
down on that against a fretboard and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
down on that against a fretboard and
pulling<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.440> pulling<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pulling it up you're just pulling the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
pulling it up you're just pulling the
whole<00:00:47.460> neck<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> instrument<00:00:49.289> mmhmm<00:00:49.680> yeah

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
whole neck of the instrument mmhmm yeah

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.290

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
your knuckle a trial and been found

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.220 
your knuckle a trial and been found
these<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.390> call<00:02:20.570> them<00:02:20.660> cheater<00:02:20.900> spoons

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
these we call them cheater spoons

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.450 
these we call them cheater spoons
because<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.620> got<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.740> handle<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.160> them<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
because it's got a handle on them and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.340 
because it's got a handle on them and
then<00:02:23.150> been<00:02:23.330> figured<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.930> could<00:02:24.050> open<00:02:24.230> up

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
then been figured out you could open up

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.140 
then been figured out you could open up
that<00:02:24.500> handle<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.070> put<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> pic<00:02:25.610> up<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.910> there

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
that handle and put a pic up in there

your made the net a little bit wider so

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.690 
your made the net a little bit wider so
I've<00:03:38.989> gone<00:03:39.890> through<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.100> different<00:03:40.250> bunch<00:03:40.610> of

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
I've gone through a different bunch of

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.170 
I've gone through a different bunch of
different<00:03:40.940> permutations<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.320> way<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.500> do

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
different permutations of the way to do

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.970 
different permutations of the way to do
percussion<00:03:44.180> not<00:03:44.269> with<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.570> feet<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.620> one

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
percussion not with the feet but the one

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.259 
percussion not with the feet but the one
I<00:03:46.010> found<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.430> works<00:03:46.610> really<00:03:46.760> good<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
I found that works really good is to

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.490 
I found that works really good is to
have<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> trunk<00:03:48.019> which<00:03:48.350> doubles<00:03:49.130> as<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.310> trunk<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
have a trunk which doubles as a trunk so

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.020 
have a trunk which doubles as a trunk so
