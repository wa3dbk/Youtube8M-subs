only<00:00:25.470> worried<00:00:25.980> about<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.250> convex<00:00:26.730> case<00:00:27.060> but

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
only worried about the convex case but

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.960 
only worried about the convex case but
the<00:00:27.810> general<00:00:28.170> problem<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.740> np-hard<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the general problem is np-hard so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
the general problem is np-hard so
computer<00:00:30.570> scientists<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.380> working<00:00:31.410> on

computer scientists are working on

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.729 
computer scientists are working on
approximation<00:00:33.110> okay<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.170> why<00:00:34.590> are

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
approximation okay so why are

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
approximation okay so why are
approximations<00:00:35.400> for<00:00:35.850> multi<00:00:36.330> unit<00:00:36.570> auctions

interesting<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> simplest

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
interesting well this is the simplest

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.570 
interesting well this is the simplest
case<00:00:40.260> where<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> clash<00:00:41.309> between

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
case where you get the clash between

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.270 
case where you get the clash between
incentive<00:00:42.390> constraints<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.350> computational

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
incentive constraints and computational

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
incentive constraints and computational
ones<00:00:44.519> the<00:00:45.030> basic<00:00:45.479> problem<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.140> algorithmic

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
ones the basic problem of algorithmic

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.850 
ones the basic problem of algorithmic
mechanism<00:00:47.549> design<00:00:48.000> okay<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.049> what's<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
mechanism design okay so what's in the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
mechanism design okay so what's in the
paper<00:00:50.089> they<00:00:51.089> find<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> new<00:00:51.720> auction<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
paper they find a new auction for the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.640 
paper they find a new auction for the
case<00:00:52.830> of<00:00:53.040> two<00:00:53.220> items<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.909> two<00:00:54.089> players<00:00:54.650> new

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
case of two items and two players new

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.880 
case of two items and two players new
auction<00:00:56.100> nice<00:00:56.909> so<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> benefits<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
auction nice so what are the benefits of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.840 
auction nice so what are the benefits of
this<00:00:59.040> new<00:00:59.280> auction<00:00:59.699> well<00:01:00.540> none<00:01:01.470> not<00:01:02.430> revenue

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
this new auction well none not revenue

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
this new auction well none not revenue
not<00:01:03.720> welfare<00:01:04.220> not<00:01:05.220> simplicity<00:01:06.020> nothing<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
not welfare not simplicity nothing is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990 
not welfare not simplicity nothing is
the<00:01:07.890> new<00:01:08.070> auction<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.670> least<00:01:08.880> elegant

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.540 

nope<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.500> somewhat<00:01:14.890> corrupted<00:01:15.520> version

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
nope it's a somewhat corrupted version

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.720 
nope it's a somewhat corrupted version
of<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.150> usual<00:01:16.630> auction<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.950> what's<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.460> point

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
of the usual auction so what's the point

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.480 
of the usual auction so what's the point
well<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.260> point<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:20.800> there<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:21.280> some

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
well the point is that there is some

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.850 
well the point is that there is some
auction<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> not<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.660> VCG<00:01:23.020> family

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
auction that is not of the VCG family

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.490 
auction that is not of the VCG family
this<00:01:24.670> means<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.240> Roberts<00:01:25.840> theorem<00:01:26.320> that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
this means that Roberts theorem that

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.710 
this means that Roberts theorem that
shows<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.800> an<00:01:27.160> unconstrained<00:01:27.850> domains<00:01:28.330> only

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
shows that an unconstrained domains only

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.200 
shows that an unconstrained domains only
VCG<00:01:29.290> mechanisms<00:01:29.950> exist<00:01:30.160> does<00:01:30.670> not<00:01:30.850> apply<00:01:31.119> to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
VCG mechanisms exist does not apply to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.170 
VCG mechanisms exist does not apply to
auction<00:01:31.780> domains<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:33.250> new<00:01:33.430> auction<00:01:33.970> does

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
auction domains and the new auction does

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.230 
auction domains and the new auction does
get<00:01:34.390> good<00:01:34.630> approximation<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.700> maybe<00:01:37.000> there

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
get good approximation so maybe there

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.510 
get good approximation so maybe there
are<00:01:37.420> yet<00:01:37.630> other<00:01:37.840> auction<00:01:38.320> formats<00:01:38.800> or<00:01:39.100> biz<00:01:39.280> to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
are yet other auction formats or biz to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.960 
are yet other auction formats or biz to
player<00:01:39.820> 2<00:01:39.850> item<00:01:40.420> case<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:41.710> they<00:01:42.220> also<00:01:42.460> show

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
player 2 item case well they also show

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.910 
player 2 item case well they also show
that<00:01:43.000> at<00:01:43.360> least<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.810> scalable<00:01:44.320> auctions

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
that at least for scalable auctions

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.609 
that at least for scalable auctions
there<00:01:45.130> are<00:01:45.280> none<00:01:45.520> this<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.720> actually<00:01:47.229> most<00:01:47.470> of

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
there are none this is actually most of

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.070 
there are none this is actually most of
the<00:01:47.680> technical<00:01:48.130> work<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.790> paper

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.910 

a<00:01:51.140> lower<00:01:51.770> bound<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.240> proof<00:01:53.510> elegant<00:01:54.020> not

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
a lower bound is the proof elegant not

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.640 
a lower bound is the proof elegant not
as<00:01:55.130> far<00:01:55.340> as<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.670> tell<00:01:55.930> they<00:01:56.930> determine<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
as far as I can tell they determine the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.620 
as far as I can tell they determine the
possible<00:01:57.830> price<00:01:58.400> structure<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.120> option

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
possible price structure and the option

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.620 
possible price structure and the option
step<00:02:00.110> by<00:02:00.350> growling<00:02:00.830> step<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:01.340> suppose<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.480> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
step by growling step I suppose that the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.540 
step by growling step I suppose that the
point<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.830> do<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.280> when

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
point is that you can do this when

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.610 
point is that you can do this when
looking<00:02:04.910> directly<00:02:05.240> at<00:02:05.510> prices<00:02:06.050> rather<00:02:06.290> than

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
looking directly at prices rather than

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.280 
looking directly at prices rather than
at<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> allocation<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.750> just<00:02:09.050> for<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
at the allocation and this just for the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.410 
at the allocation and this just for the
case<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.680> two<00:02:09.860> items

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
case of two items

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.870 
case of two items
so<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.380> strongest<00:02:12.860> thing<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.340> they<00:02:13.490> show<00:02:13.700> is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
so the strongest thing that they show is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.760 
so the strongest thing that they show is
