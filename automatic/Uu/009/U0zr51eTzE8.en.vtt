00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.119
 then my job my activity is 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.010
 only furniture restoration 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.650
 so all types of furniture as well 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.480
 massive furniture the good beer fed up 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.610
 grandmothers that plate furniture 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.410
 is typically the chili secretary 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.000
 for the dresser louis philippe and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.230
 then all the furniture in marquetry 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 see boulle marquetry 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.730
 here but no manufacturing cons 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.470
 a mastery of all 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
 techniques related to his bad I 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.519
 works for any type of clientele 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.260
 it happens to me even punctually 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.140
 work for churches but 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.909
 so basically private customers 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.190
 who come from all backgrounds all 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.989
 all need in terms of restoration 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.449
 I am not specialized in a type of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.170
 furniture I am really specialized in 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.239
 restoration 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.120
 I will not do any manufacturing I 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.070
 not the organization the workshops for that 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.080
 by cons I have all the equipment 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.210
 the organization to make the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.400
 restoration and suddenly I sweep the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 furniture from the seventeenth century to furniture 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 of the 20th century 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.000
 the varnish with the buffer is I would say the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.649
 treogat nail polish which is beautiful which 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.659
 gives a rendering on the furniture 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.950
 absolutely fabulous we have some 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.079
 number of examples here in the workshop 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 by cons is very technical is 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.439
 very long there is first a whole 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.359
 preparation of the surface that is called 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.710
 fills it can already ask 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.929
 several weeks with the times of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.729
 drying and then we will work 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.369
 this varnish years it comprises a buffer 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.289
 blunder cotton and we will work the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.289
 furniture and there too it can ask 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.909
 several weeks and that's I would say 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.130
 hours and hours of work for 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.020
 get the rendering of the varnish so much more 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.719
 the technique to eliminate therefore the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.729
 xylophagous insects is called anoxia 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.229
 the principle is to kill the critters 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.569
 for lack of oxygen 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.210
 so in fact we create a plastic bag 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.280
 around the piece of furniture that we are going to lock 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 tightly and indoors 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.530
 will put bags that will absorb 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.640
 oxygen and so we'll let the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.460
 cooking recipe is simple it's 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.130
 let's simmer 21 days to 21 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.950
 degrees to kill all the critters to 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.870
 heart in the wood the process allows for 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.330
 can treat it on the one hand from a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.550
 way 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.690
 effective there one is certain it's a 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.670
 process that has been validated by 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.690
 historical monuments and more that is 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.690
 an ecological process
