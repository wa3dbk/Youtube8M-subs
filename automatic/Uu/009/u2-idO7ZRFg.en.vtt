so<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.310> fears<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.260> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so these fears that I have and that you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.070 
so these fears that I have and that you
may<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.490> connected<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.840> economic

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
system because if the economic system

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
system because if the economic system
breaks<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.220> be

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
breaks down then there's going to be

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
breaks down then there's going to be
more<00:02:11.520> challenges<00:02:12.120> people<00:02:12.840> after<00:02:13.440> most
