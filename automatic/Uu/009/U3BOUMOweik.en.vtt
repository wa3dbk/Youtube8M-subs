a lot of other ultra books creating a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
a lot of other ultra books creating a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bit of a disconnect actually taking this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
bit of a disconnect actually taking this
one<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> CES<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.180> fun<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
one out to CES was kind of fun because

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
one out to CES was kind of fun because
the<00:01:19.320> Ethernet<00:01:19.920> port<00:01:19.950> made<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.759> more

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the Ethernet port made it a little more

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
the Ethernet port made it a little more
reliable<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.570> landlines<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.009> going

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
reliable for landlines now it is going

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
reliable for landlines now it is going
to<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.670> room<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.030> backpack

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to take up more room in your backpack

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
to take up more room in your backpack
but<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.740> over<00:01:25.920> three<00:01:26.189> pounds<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
but it's a little over three pounds and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
but it's a little over three pounds and
it's<00:01:27.150> still<00:01:27.360> pretty<00:01:27.689> light<00:01:27.960> compared<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it's still pretty light compared to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's still pretty light compared to
other<00:01:28.560> laptops<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> depends<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.970> what

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
other laptops so it depends on what

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
other laptops so it depends on what
you're<00:01:30.299> comparing<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.710> small

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you're comparing to it has a small

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
you're comparing to it has a small
business<00:01:32.430> type<00:01:32.640> feel<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.360> brush<00:01:33.659> metal<00:01:33.900> lid

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
business type feel the brush metal lid

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.130 
business type feel the brush metal lid
kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> slightly<00:01:35.790> no-nonsense<00:01:36.420> design

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
kind of a slightly no-nonsense design

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.050 
kind of a slightly no-nonsense design
but<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> pays<00:01:38.549> attention<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
but you know what it pays attention to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
but you know what it pays attention to
