00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
backfield with Trey Mason and I think

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
backfield with Trey Mason and I think
that's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.309> punch

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that's a really really good one to punch

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
that's a really really good one to punch
the<00:00:59.789> former<00:01:00.090> auto<00:01:00.270> running<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:01.050> paired

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

up with the Georgia running back well

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
up with the Georgia running back well
think<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.930> Nick<00:01:04.170> Foles<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.769> st.<00:01:05.220> Louis

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
think now with Nick Foles in st. Louis

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.219 
think now with Nick Foles in st. Louis
they're<00:01:05.820> gonna<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> consistent<00:01:06.869> offense

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
they're gonna have a consistent offense

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
they're gonna have a consistent offense
they<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> reliable<00:01:08.070> two<00:01:08.580> running<00:01:08.909> backs

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they have a reliable two running backs

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
they have a reliable two running backs
in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> backfield<00:01:09.360> Trey<00:01:09.900> Mason<00:01:10.020> had<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> pretty

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
in the backfield Trey Mason had a pretty

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
in the backfield Trey Mason had a pretty
good<00:01:10.680> rookie<00:01:11.010> year<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.610> add<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.060> entirely<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
good rookie year now add an entirely to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
good rookie year now add an entirely to
the<00:01:12.900> mix<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.470> potentially<00:01:14.040> could<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the mix that potentially could be a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
the mix that potentially could be a
pretty<00:01:14.700> potent<00:01:15.060> offense<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.479> mean<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> don't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
pretty potent offense I mean I don't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
pretty potent offense I mean I don't
have<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> greatest<00:01:16.350> wide<00:01:16.650> receivers<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
have the greatest wide receivers on the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.219 
have the greatest wide receivers on the
outside<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> consistent<00:01:18.990> play

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
outside there with a consistent play

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.690 
outside there with a consistent play
from<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> running<00:01:20.009> backs<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.520> think

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
from the running backs which I think

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
from the running backs which I think
that<00:01:20.820> we'll<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.630> Todd<00:01:21.840> Gurley<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> Trey

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that we'll get with Todd Gurley and Trey

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
that we'll get with Todd Gurley and Trey
Mason<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.000> Nick<00:01:24.180> Foles<00:01:24.420> who<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
Mason and now with Nick Foles who is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.539 
Mason and now with Nick Foles who is
most<00:01:25.170> likely<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.619> stay<00:01:25.920> healthy<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
most likely gonna stay healthy if that

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
most likely gonna stay healthy if that

he's going to be great like I said in my
Melvin<00:01:48.090> Gordon<00:01:48.390> video<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:48.899> both<00:01:49.110> these

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
Melvin Gordon video I think both these

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.389 
Melvin Gordon video I think both these
running<00:01:49.590> backs<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.920> were<00:01:50.009> picked<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.369> the

running backs that were picked in the
first<00:01:50.670> round<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.409> be

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.280 
first round I think they're going to be
fantastic<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.060> both<00:01:54.299> fit<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> the

most NFL already running back I've seen
long<00:02:10.340> time<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.940> think<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.360> kind<00:02:11.570> of<00:02:11.630> took<00:02:11.780> like

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
long time I think it kind of took like

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.600 
long time I think it kind of took like
the<00:02:12.080> perfect<00:02:12.500> team<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> team<00:02:13.580> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the perfect team to get on the team that

the perfect team to get on the team that
really<00:02:14.060> warned<00:02:14.300> them<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.570> obviously<00:02:14.840> the

really warned them and obviously the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.630

range<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.500> them<00:02:15.620> because<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:15.920> mean<00:02:16.130> there

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
range one of them because I mean there

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.460 
range one of them because I mean there
are<00:02:16.670> few<00:02:17.390> questions<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:17.930> know<00:02:18.080> rather<00:02:18.260> he'll
