00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
how to run this offline now this is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
how to run this offline now this is
going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.430> useful<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> system

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
going to be very useful if the system

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
going to be very useful if the system
can't<00:00:40.260> boot<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:41.190> you've<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.700> corrupt<00:00:42.030> Windows

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
we can do is boot up to a recovery CD or

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
we can do is boot up to a recovery CD or
window<00:00:48.030> CD<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.690> run<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.170> offline<00:00:49.770> okay<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

this video now SFC scare now is a
crucial<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.309> kit<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.730> windows<00:00:57.149> because

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
crucial bit of kit for windows because

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
crucial bit of kit for windows because
if<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.309> you've<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> problem<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.449> Windows

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
if if you've got a problem with Windows

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
if if you've got a problem with Windows
what<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> check<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
what it's going to do is check the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
what it's going to do is check the
integrity<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.680> windows<00:01:05.040> system<00:01:05.489> files

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
integrity of the windows system files

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
integrity of the windows system files
and<00:01:06.060> also<00:01:06.900> replace<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.680> files<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.340> they

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and also replace those files if they

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
and also replace those files if they
need<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.970> replaced<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.320> fix<00:01:10.560> them

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
need to be replaced or just fix them

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
need to be replaced or just fix them
okay<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.150> decent<00:01:12.540> tool<00:01:13.020> from

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
okay so it's a really decent tool from

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
okay so it's a really decent tool from
Windows<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:15.030> built<00:01:15.299> into<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> operating

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
Windows that's built into the operating

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
Windows that's built into the operating
system<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.890> we're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
system so we're going to do here is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
system so we're going to do here is
reboot<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> system<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> I'll<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> how

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
reboot the system and I'll show you how

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.510 
reboot the system and I'll show you how
to<00:01:19.909> get<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.500> Windows<00:01:22.950> CD<00:01:23.340> or

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to get into this from a Windows CD or

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
to get into this from a Windows CD or
recovery<00:01:24.000> CD<00:01:24.270> okay<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.320> assuming<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
recovery CD okay so assuming that we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.940 
recovery CD okay so assuming that we
can't<00:01:26.280> boot<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.390> system<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> what

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
can't boot the system up this is what

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
can't boot the system up this is what
we're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.270> can

boot<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.409> run<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> desktop

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
boot you can run it from the desktop

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960 
boot you can run it from the desktop
here<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.329> command<00:01:33.689> prompt<00:01:34.020> okay<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> let's

our<00:02:30.100> windows<00:02:30.550> directory<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.410> we'll<00:02:32.590> try<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.100> D<00:02:33.610> :

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
our windows directory so we'll try a D :

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.150 
our windows directory so we'll try a D :
and<00:02:34.830> check<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> dir<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.270> make<00:02:37.450> sure<00:02:38.160> okay

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and check a dir just to make sure okay

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.400 
and check a dir just to make sure okay
now<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:40.000> windows<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.990> D

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
now you can see windows is in the D

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
now you can see windows is in the D
directory<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.190> okay<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.200> recovery<00:02:44.430> CD

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
directory here okay for this recovery CD

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.150 
directory here okay for this recovery CD
or<00:02:45.640> Windows<00:02:46.000> CD<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.170> what<00:02:47.410> we<00:02:47.500> want<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.740> do<00:02:47.890> here

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
or Windows CD so what we want to do here

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.210 
or Windows CD so what we want to do here
now<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.370> run<00:02:48.730> our<00:02:48.910> scan<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.190> a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
now is run our scan so it's not like a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.730 
now is run our scan so it's not like a
windows<00:02:51.880> where<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.240> can<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.600> run<00:02:52.840> SFC<00:02:53.410> scan

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
windows where you can just run SFC scan

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.610 
windows where you can just run SFC scan
now<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.190> that's<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:55.030> need<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.210> do<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:56.170> bit

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
now and that's it you need to do a bit

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.940 
now and that's it you need to do a bit
of<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:56.770> lengthy<00:02:57.810> code<00:02:58.810> here<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.200> make<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.740> run

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
of a lengthy code here to make it run

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.150 
of a lengthy code here to make it run
okay<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.460> we're<00:03:00.730> going<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.910> type<00:03:01.210> SFC<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.160> then

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
okay so we're going to type SFC and then

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.000 
okay so we're going to type SFC and then
forward<00:03:03.490> slash<00:03:03.990> space<00:03:05.190> /scannow<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.800> and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
forward slash space /scannow like so and

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.170 
forward slash space /scannow like so and
then<00:03:09.970> space<00:03:10.300> food<00:03:11.170> slash<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.430> off<00:03:12.610> boot

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
then space food slash and in off boot

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.250 
then space food slash and in off boot
dir<00:03:17.400> PI<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.690> we<00:03:19.870> want<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.110> do

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
dir PI that and then we want to do

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.400 
dir PI that and then we want to do
equals<00:03:20.890> D<00:03:22.170> :

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
equals D :

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.000 
equals D :
backslash<00:03:24.420> okay<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.620> move<00:03:26.830> that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
backslash okay and you just move that

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.410 
backslash okay and you just move that
out<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.250> way<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.730> see<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
out of the way so you can see that and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.570 
out of the way so you can see that and
then<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:29.050> want<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> do<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> space<00:03:29.830> here<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.370> in

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
then we want to do a space here and in

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.740 
then we want to do a space here and in
forward<00:03:30.940> slash<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.510> then<00:03:32.500> off<00:03:33.180> window<00:03:34.180> win

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
forward slash and then off window win

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.130 
forward slash and then off window win
dir<00:03:35.590> that's<00:03:35.920> what<00:03:36.100> we<00:03:36.220> want<00:03:36.400> next<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:40.930> and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
dir that's what we want next like so and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.390 
dir that's what we want next like so and
then<00:03:41.560> equals<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.360> want<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.630> do<00:03:44.940> D<00:03:45.940> :

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
then equals and then we want to do D :

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.360 
then equals and then we want to do D :
backslash<00:03:48.400> windows<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.800> what<00:03:50.980> that's<00:03:51.160> going

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
backslash windows and what that's going

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.310 
backslash windows and what that's going
to<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.610> is<00:03:51.880> basically<00:03:53.850> run<00:03:54.850> this<00:03:55.060> SFC<00:03:55.660> scan<00:03:56.080> now

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
to do is basically run this SFC scan now

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.670 
to do is basically run this SFC scan now
off<00:03:56.920> boot<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.360> it's<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.019> do<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.320> offline

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
off boot and it's going to do it offline

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.210 
off boot and it's going to do it offline
okay<00:04:00.030> now<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.510> run<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.380> an<00:04:02.680> actual

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
okay now you can run just a an actual

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.610 
okay now you can run just a an actual
scan<00:04:03.519> for<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:03.970> one<00:04:04.180> particular<00:04:04.600> file<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.380> you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
scan for just one particular file if you

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.640 
scan for just one particular file if you
wish<00:04:05.800> as<00:04:05.980> well<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.570> be<00:04:07.660> honest<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.500> might

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
wish as well but to be honest you might

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.289 
wish as well but to be honest you might
as<00:04:08.769> well<00:04:08.800> just<00:04:09.070> run<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.250> full<00:04:09.519> scan<00:04:09.549> on<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
as well just run a full scan on the

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.390 
as well just run a full scan on the
system<00:04:10.660> okay<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.799> know<00:04:11.950> exactly

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
system okay and this you know exactly

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400 
system okay and this you know exactly
what<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.700> file<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.299> that's<00:04:13.540> corrupt

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
what that file is that's corrupt

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.199 
what that file is that's corrupt
then<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.590> would<00:04:14.710> have<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:15.010> change<00:04:15.310> this<00:04:15.610> okay

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
then you would have to change this okay

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.949 
then you would have to change this okay
to<00:04:16.840> scan<00:04:17.280> file<00:04:18.280> here<00:04:18.820> okay<00:04:19.239> they<00:04:19.720> will<00:04:19.810> be

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
to scan file here okay they will be

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.500 
to scan file here okay they will be
different<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:21.760> we're<00:04:21.910> going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> do<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.330> push

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
different so we're going to do is push

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.290 
different so we're going to do is push
enter<00:04:22.810> here<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.430> straight<00:04:24.430> away<00:04:24.700> just<00:04:24.730> now

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
enter here and straight away just now

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.620 
enter here and straight away just now
we'll<00:04:25.600> run<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.140> scan<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:27.100> system<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.730> fix

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
we'll run a scan on that system and fix

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.250 
we'll run a scan on that system and fix
any<00:04:28.980> issues<00:04:29.980> with<00:04:30.970> any<00:04:31.150> windows<00:04:31.750> files<00:04:32.080> it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
any issues with any windows files it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.870 
any issues with any windows files it
will<00:04:32.290> check<00:04:32.500> all<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.740> integrity<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.520> those

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
will check all the integrity of those

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240 
will check all the integrity of those
windows<00:04:34.270> files<00:04:34.570> okay<00:04:35.020> anything<00:04:35.920> that<00:04:36.070> needs

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
windows files okay anything that needs

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.480 
windows files okay anything that needs
to<00:04:36.310> be<00:04:36.400> replaced<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:37.150> will<00:04:37.360> replace<00:04:37.660> them<00:04:37.990> and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
to be replaced it will replace them and

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.000 
to be replaced it will replace them and
anything<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.670> needs<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.120> be<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:41.470> fixed<00:04:41.830> it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
anything that needs to be just fixed it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.520 
anything that needs to be just fixed it
will<00:04:42.370> fix<00:04:42.520> them<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.600> we'll<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:43.930> let<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.230> run

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
will fix them so we'll just let this run

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.130 
will fix them so we'll just let this run
and<00:04:44.740> then<00:04:45.310> once<00:04:45.490> this<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:45.820> run<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.660> can<00:04:46.840> reboot

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
and then once this is run we can reboot

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.170 
and then once this is run we can reboot
the<00:04:47.290> system<00:04:47.440> hopefully<00:04:47.920> you'll<00:04:48.640> be<00:04:48.820> back<00:04:49.000> at

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the system hopefully you'll be back at

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.460 
coming up showing up as d you need to
make<00:05:21.820> sure<00:05:21.850> that<00:05:22.060> is<00:05:22.390> correct<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.020> yourself

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
make sure that is correct for yourself

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.400 
make sure that is correct for yourself
and<00:05:23.880> obviously<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.180> actual<00:05:25.330> file<00:05:25.840> name<00:05:25.870> as

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
and obviously the actual file name as

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.160 
and obviously the actual file name as
you<00:05:26.860> can<00:05:27.040> see<00:05:27.250> there<00:05:27.490> may<00:05:28.060> be<00:05:28.090> different<00:05:28.690> for

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
you can see there may be different for

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.780 
you can see there may be different for
the<00:05:29.260> particular<00:05:29.590> file<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:30.250> you're<00:05:30.460> going<00:05:30.700> to

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
the particular file that you're going to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.210 
the particular file that you're going to
scan<00:05:31.210> for<00:05:31.540> okay<00:05:31.840> that's<00:05:32.380> if<00:05:32.530> you<00:05:32.650> want<00:05:32.830> to<00:05:32.950> scan

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
scan for okay that's if you want to scan

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.430 
scan for okay that's if you want to scan
for<00:05:33.460> one<00:05:33.730> particular<00:05:33.970> file<00:05:34.660> you'd<00:05:35.169> use<00:05:35.410> that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
for one particular file you'd use that

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.370 
for one particular file you'd use that
command<00:05:36.010> so<00:05:36.820> let's<00:05:37.000> just<00:05:37.600> let<00:05:37.780> this<00:05:37.900> run<00:05:38.169> and

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
command so let's just let this run and

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.370 
command so let's just let this run and
we'll<00:05:39.160> come<00:05:39.400> back<00:05:39.430> when<00:05:39.700> it's<00:05:39.880> finished<00:05:40.380> okay

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
we'll come back when it's finished okay

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.050 
we'll come back when it's finished okay
so<00:05:41.440> that's<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.890> actual<00:05:42.010> scan<00:05:42.490> now<00:05:42.669> finished

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
so that's the actual scan now finished

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.909 
so that's the actual scan now finished
and<00:05:43.240> as<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.570> see<00:05:43.630> here<00:05:44.140> we've<00:05:44.890> got

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
and as you can see here we've got

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.330 
and as you can see here we've got
windows<00:05:45.490> resource<00:05:45.760> protection<00:05:46.919> did<00:05:47.919> not<00:05:48.070> find

windows resource protection did not find

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.300 
windows resource protection did not find
any<00:05:48.640> integrity<00:05:49.410> violations<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:51.100> means

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
any integrity violations and that means

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.940 
any integrity violations and that means
we're<00:05:51.550> all<00:05:51.580> okay<00:05:52.180> okay<00:05:52.990> now<00:05:53.140> obviously<00:05:53.290> if<00:05:53.740> you

we're all okay okay now obviously if you

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.830 
we're all okay okay now obviously if you
add<00:05:54.070> issues<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.760> would<00:05:54.970> have<00:05:55.090> fixed<00:05:55.270> those<00:05:55.540> for

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840

add issues it would have fixed those for
you<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.200> hopefully<00:05:56.950> you'll<00:05:57.820> be<00:05:58.000> at<00:05:58.090> a<00:05:58.120> boot

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
you and hopefully you'll be at a boot

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.750 
you and hopefully you'll be at a boot
back<00:05:58.540> up<00:05:58.750> into<00:05:58.960> your<00:05:59.050> operating<00:05:59.530> system<00:05:59.890> so

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
back up into your operating system so

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.880 
back up into your operating system so
let's<00:06:00.940> exit<00:06:01.330> out<00:06:01.419> of<00:06:01.480> this<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:01.960> reboot<00:06:02.740> the

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
let's exit out of this and reboot the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.000 
let's exit out of this and reboot the
system<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.460> we<00:06:03.730> should<00:06:03.970> be<00:06:04.120> good<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.480> go<00:06:05.010> so

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
system and we should be good to go so

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.350 
system and we should be good to go so
pretty<00:06:06.280> much<00:06:06.430> I<00:06:06.640> think<00:06:06.700> that's<00:06:07.060> going<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.270> be

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
pretty much I think that's going to be

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.480 
pretty much I think that's going to be
about<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.720> for<00:06:07.900> this<00:06:07.960> video<00:06:08.140> and<00:06:08.830> that's<00:06:09.310> how
