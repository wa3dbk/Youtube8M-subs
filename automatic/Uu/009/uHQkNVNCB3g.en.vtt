00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
 to my question I hope it looks like me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.320
 I have is a test that earned a salary 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 700 thousand monthly and I have three children in 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.660
 thirds that I would like to know all part 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.890
 true to a scholarship from the activity of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.079
 government 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 I have serve because I have the dps that the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.070
 public the campus of how it can be a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.810
 of chains 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.550
 fernando thank you very much for your 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.410
 participation in a crystal and good 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 very reiterated the question very reiterated 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 inclusive of people who are not inside 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
 of the sisben that has a level of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.900
 salary the minimum wage, but not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.470
 is inside the sisbén but again 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.870
 I would like Colombians 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.449
 they knew we should not confuse between 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 be affiliated with the subsidized regime of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.180
 health or an ips and have been a participant 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.900
 of the survey of the sisbén the sisbén is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.170
 the system of service beneficiaries 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.009
 social 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.080
 and with that system we assign the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.450
 entrance to many social services to 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.759
 subsidized health scheme for young people in 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.670
 action to families in action to credits 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.140
 of the icetex then the sisben is something 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.960
 different from the subsidized health regime 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 or to be a row of ps2 are two things 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.250
 totally different 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.100
 it is possible that the viewer 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.530
 earlier so be working as you have 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.960
 an average salary has so many children 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.939
 It is probably the only income that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.740
 they have their family it is possible that if 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.200
 once they did the survey of 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.140
 sisbén is cataloged in about 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.299
 let's say lower levels of this 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 this resource the only problem that 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.990
 I see fernando is that I do not know how many years 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.580
 will have and if and if he is already a bachelor 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.340
 you have to take into account that the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.500
 requirements to access this scholarship are 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.990
 having presented the icfes on August 3 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.290
 on August 3 to have obtained in 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.050
 the icfes test 310 or more points 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.070
 and be in the survey score 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.770
 sisben on average less than 57 points 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.710
 there are differences between urban and rural without 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.780
 Fernando wants to start studying and not 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.000
 meets these requirements because it does not 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.190
 is bachelor is an adult what do I know about 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.640
 all forms can enter the page of 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.140
 icex internet and there consult the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.420
 different options that the government 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.860
 national today has open for 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.720
 people who want to enter the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 higher education page 17 is like 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.780
 in your www v / s text dot goal.com now 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.240
 We can do the other thing because the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.010
 subsidy to the demand that is what 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.050
 we do with the vice techno the only 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.480
 way to enter higher education in 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.709
 our country there are also 80 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.250
 Higher education institutions 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.310
 public almost all have a license plate 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.770
 very low or almost zero so it's also 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.990
 another option for smoking options 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.010
 of a question that came to me through the 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.270
 social networks 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.060
 from san andrés de juliana towers s 3 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.740
 the question he asks is and what is the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.220
 process to restore the san plan 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.670
 andrés alliance scholarships and mini cts 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.440
 education we need them on that 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.390
 we have some answers to these 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.390
 people and there is a very program 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.270
 important this 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.550
 has been permanently supporting the 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.700
 acronyms of san andrés providencia santa 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.010
 catalina and for that reason it was created in this year 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.880
 and in the previous year also a fund 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.010
 special that is a 100% forgiveness 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.280
 to benefit at that time has been 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.540
 calculated of 350 students we could 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.459
 as we announced to Mr. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.700
 president thanks to the resources get 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.250
 until favoring 700 students was 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.560
 something very important and we believe that therefore 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.820
 We will continue to be aware of 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.400
 how to get to increase and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.000
 present some new offers 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 precisely for the islanders
