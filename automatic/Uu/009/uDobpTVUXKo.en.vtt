dispersant<00:01:47.789> is<00:01:47.850> taken<00:01:48.179> off<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> oil<00:01:48.719> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
dispersant is taken off into the oil so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
dispersant is taken off into the oil so
when<00:01:49.499> you<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.709> get<00:01:49.859> the<00:01:49.950> Andrew<00:01:50.189> freed<00:01:50.429> up<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
when you do get the Andrew freed up and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.699 
when you do get the Andrew freed up and
run<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.200> change<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.499> oil<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
run it then you just change the oil and

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.919 
run it then you just change the oil and
the<00:01:52.829> rust<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.219> gone<00:01:53.509> also<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.569> know<00:01:54.749> this

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
the rust is gone also you know this

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.870 
the rust is gone also you know this
thing<00:01:55.139> it<00:01:55.649> removes<00:01:56.009> rust<00:01:56.219> lubricates<00:01:56.789> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thing it removes rust lubricates the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.089 
thing it removes rust lubricates the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
layer lubrication on the Rings so you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.959 
layer lubrication on the Rings so you
don't<00:02:01.560> call<00:02:01.770> them<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> great<00:02:02.670> product

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
don't call them it's a great product

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.029 
don't call them it's a great product
what<00:02:03.209> I've<00:02:03.329> been<00:02:03.450> doing<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.810> every<00:02:04.649> day<00:02:04.799> been

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
what I've been doing is every day been

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.440 
what I've been doing is every day been
putting<00:02:05.249> about<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.490> ounce<00:02:05.609> ounce<00:02:06.029> and<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> half

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
putting about an ounce ounce and a half

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630 
putting about an ounce ounce and a half
in<00:02:06.599> each<00:02:06.689> spark<00:02:06.990> plug<00:02:07.259> hole<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> way

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in each spark plug hole all the way

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.460 
in each spark plug hole all the way
along<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> letting<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.300> sit<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.810> did<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.349> for

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
along and letting it sit I did that for

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.260 
along and letting it sit I did that for
a<00:02:10.530> couple<00:02:10.560> days<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.550> crank<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> engine

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
a couple days then I crank the engine

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.160 
a couple days then I crank the engine
through<00:02:12.450> by<00:02:12.630> hand

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

what<00:02:33.940> we<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.210> here<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
what we have here is it's just a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.040 
what we have here is it's just a
container<00:02:35.980> has<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> bladder<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.840> put

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
container has a bladder in it you put

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.000 
container has a bladder in it you put
oil<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.710> it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
oil on it in it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.610 
oil on it in it
you<00:02:39.460> put<00:02:39.700> air<00:02:39.850> pressure<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.410> take

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you put air pressure to it can you take

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.220 
you put air pressure to it can you take
this<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.160> adapt<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.880> line<00:02:43.180> into<00:02:43.630> where

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
this and you adapt this line into where

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.570 
this and you adapt this line into where
your<00:02:44.350> oil<00:02:44.380> pressure<00:02:44.650> sending<00:02:45.070> unit<00:02:45.190> would<00:02:45.460> go

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
your oil pressure sending unit would go

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.810 
your oil pressure sending unit would go
open<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> valve<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.890> forces<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.640> oil

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
open the valve and it forces the oil

ignition and I'm just going to crank it
you<00:03:22.270> can<00:03:22.420> hear<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> now<00:03:25.590> I've<00:03:26.590> got<00:03:26.800> our

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
you can hear it now I've got our

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.290 
you can hear it now I've got our

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
so before we start it we want to see

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.020 
so before we start it we want to see
cranking<00:03:30.760> oil<00:03:30.970> pressure<00:03:34.470> that's<00:03:35.470> great<00:03:36.030> all
