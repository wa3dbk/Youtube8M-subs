00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
of where a beginner kind of should start

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.810 
of where a beginner kind of should start
in<00:00:12.059> terms<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.660> know<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> base<00:00:13.820> or

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
in terms of you know this is the base or

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.609 
in terms of you know this is the base or
you<00:00:14.969> say<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> more<00:00:15.750> advanced<00:00:16.049> you

you say we're kind of more advanced you
know<00:00:17.000> percussion<00:00:18.000> parts<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.630> um<00:00:20.090> well<00:00:21.090> let's

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
know percussion parts so um well let's

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
know percussion parts so um well let's
see<00:00:24.050> more<00:00:25.050> advanced<00:00:25.320> parts<00:00:25.529> well<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:26.279> your

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
see more advanced parts well your your

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.740 
see more advanced parts well your your
bass<00:00:26.640> drums<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:27.119> plastics<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.599> just

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
bass drums your plastics or just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
bass drums your plastics or just
classical<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> bass<00:00:28.740> thump<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.519> down

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
classical of bass thump would be down

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.110 
classical of bass thump would be down
here<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.250> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:33.000> any

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
here and up here and if you have any

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.959 
here and up here and if you have any
sort<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> experience<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> drum<00:00:34.350> kit<00:00:34.969> it's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
sort of experience with a drum kit it's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.780 
sort of experience with a drum kit it's
a<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.750> easy<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> identify<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:38.100> parts<00:00:38.550> work

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
a it's easy to identify which parts work

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
a it's easy to identify which parts work
where<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.140> example<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> classic

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
where right for example a classic

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.910 
where right for example a classic
standard<00:00:41.790> drum<00:00:42.660> groove<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:43.530> perhaps<00:00:43.710> be

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
standard drum groove would perhaps be

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.490 
standard drum groove would perhaps be
the<00:00:44.760> bass<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.180> beat<00:00:45.360> one<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.809> snare<00:00:46.440> drum<00:00:50.329> on

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
the bass on beat one a snare drum on

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.700 
the bass on beat one a snare drum on
beats<00:00:52.500> beat<00:00:53.039> two<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.300> repeat<00:00:54.809> three<00:00:55.260> four

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
beats beat two one to repeat three four

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.819 
beats beat two one to repeat three four
right<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.260> time<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.739> through

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
right but I think over time and through

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
right but I think over time and through
refining<00:00:59.510> refining<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.629> own<00:01:00.750> technique<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
refining refining your own technique and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
refining refining your own technique and
finding<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.129> own<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.940> subtle

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
finding out your own little subtle

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.870 
finding out your own little subtle
nuances<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> micro<00:01:04.589> techniques<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
nuances and micro techniques you can you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
nuances and micro techniques you can you
can<00:01:06.030> combine<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.720> different<00:01:07.320> ways<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
can combine them in different ways and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.840 
can combine them in different ways and
perhaps<00:01:08.549> more<00:01:09.060> detailed<00:01:09.510> ways<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.290> let's<00:01:10.850> say

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
perhaps more detailed ways so let's say

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
perhaps more detailed ways so let's say
you<00:01:11.909> start<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.570> something<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.350> bass

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you start with something like a bass

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
you start with something like a bass
note<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.080> note<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.470> keep<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
note just just one note will keep it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
note just just one note will keep it
very<00:01:16.860> simple<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.549> note<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> kind<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
very simple one note and it's kind of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.960 
very simple one note and it's kind of
funky<00:01:18.869> rhythm<00:01:19.140> sort<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:24.530> something<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.650> this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
funky rhythm sort of something like this

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
funky rhythm sort of something like this
and<00:01:26.970> add<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> bass<00:01:27.479> drums<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.100> would

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and add the bass drums in so this would

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.830 
and add the bass drums in so this would
be<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.460> picking<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.119> index<00:01:30.450> finger<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
be me picking with my index finger and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
be me picking with my index finger and
the<00:01:31.170> bass<00:01:31.320> drums<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> heel<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the bass drums would be with the heel of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.740 
the bass drums would be with the heel of
the<00:01:32.759> hand<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> sort<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.080 

something<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.439> add<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.369> some<00:01:41.400> snare

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
something like that I add in some snare

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
something like that I add in some snare
drums<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> snare<00:01:42.750> drums<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:44.009> I'll<00:01:44.189> use<00:01:44.399> here

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
drums the snare drums that I'll use here

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.690 
drums the snare drums that I'll use here
will<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:46.189> okay<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
will be here okay so this is just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.870 
will be here okay so this is just
slapping<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> end<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> fingerboard

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
slapping at the end of the fingerboard

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
slapping at the end of the fingerboard
thumb<00:01:50.880> hitting<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> wood<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:52.409> okay

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
thumb hitting the wood as well okay

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.330 
thumb hitting the wood as well okay
because<00:01:53.490> without<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.970> thumb<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.740> sounds<00:01:56.070> okay

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
because without the thumb it sounds okay

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060 
because without the thumb it sounds okay
but<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> thumb<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but with the thumb you really get the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.149 
but with the thumb you really get the
bite<00:01:59.310> okay<00:02:00.380> let's<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.619> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.590 

okay<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:06.399> that's<00:02:06.579> on<00:02:06.729> still<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.179> beats<00:02:07.390> two<00:02:07.569> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
okay so that's on still on beats two and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.270 
okay so that's on still on beats two and
four<00:02:07.749> it's<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.470> we've<00:02:08.560> got<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.830> little<00:02:09.160> bit

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
four it's just we've got a little bit

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.039 
four it's just we've got a little bit
more<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:10.840> right<00:02:11.670> -<00:02:14.700> okay<00:02:15.730> um<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
more going on right - okay um and you

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.920 
more going on right - okay um and you
can<00:02:17.170> take<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.319> even<00:02:17.470> further<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.099> could

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
can take it even further you could

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:38.000 
can take it even further you could
integrate<00:02:19.930> some<00:02:20.349> shuffle<00:02:21.190> hi-hat<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:22.060> good

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.839 

get<00:02:39.010> some<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.750> by<00:02:40.750> tapping<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.170> harmonics

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
get some little by tapping the harmonics

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.069 
get some little by tapping the harmonics
get<00:02:42.849> some<00:02:43.000> almost<00:02:43.829> ride<00:02:44.829> Bell<00:02:45.129> kinda<00:02:45.730> or<00:02:46.540> even

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
get some almost ride Bell kinda or even

00:02:47.079 --> 00:03:01.710 
get some almost ride Bell kinda or even
melodic<00:02:47.470> phrases<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> offbeat<00:03:00.209> okay<00:03:01.209> so

when<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.700> sort<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.730> break<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.120> down<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.420> its

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
when you sort of break it down to its

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.360 
when you sort of break it down to its
fundamental<00:03:04.780> parts<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.709> can<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.220> can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
fundamental parts you can you can

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.370 
fundamental parts you can you can
understand<00:03:06.970> what's<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.690> it's<00:03:08.230> just

through<00:03:08.590> time<00:03:08.889> you<00:03:09.280> sort<00:03:09.849> of<00:03:09.910> develop<00:03:10.269> your

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
through time you sort of develop your

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.410 
through time you sort of develop your
own<00:03:10.420> way<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.889> splicing<00:03:11.889> it<00:03:12.099> all<00:03:12.220> together<00:03:12.420> it's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
own way of splicing it all together it's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.360 
own way of splicing it all together it's
just<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.599> break<00:03:13.780> down<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.139> I<00:03:14.170> did<00:03:14.410> there<00:03:14.680> in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
just to break down what I did there in

the<00:03:18.970> hi-hat<00:03:19.359> thing<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.829> song<00:03:21.010> called

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
the hi-hat thing I have a song called

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.490 
the hi-hat thing I have a song called
boogie<00:03:21.430> slam<00:03:21.940> which<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> first<00:03:23.139> track<00:03:23.349> of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
boogie slam which is the first track of

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.800 
boogie slam which is the first track of
my<00:03:23.859> album<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.549> it's<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.239> different<00:03:25.359> tuning

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
my album and it's in a different tuning

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.229 
my album and it's in a different tuning
so<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.019> can't<00:03:26.200> replay<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:26.680> um<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.970> starts

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
so I can't replay it but um it starts

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.120 
so I can't replay it but um it starts
with<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:28.419> kind<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:31.000> coming<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.440> I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
with this kind of this coming and I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.849 
with this kind of this coming and I
found<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.639> really<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:34.030> sort<00:03:35.019> of<00:03:35.049> came<00:03:35.650> up<00:03:35.739> with

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
found that really a sort of came up with

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.089 
found that really a sort of came up with
that<00:03:35.919> idea<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:37.829> found<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:38.950> really

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
that idea and found it really

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.890 
that idea and found it really
interesting<00:03:39.280> how<00:03:39.669> you<00:03:39.730> could<00:03:39.970> get<00:03:40.599> different

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
interesting how you could get different

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.589 
interesting how you could get different
sort<00:03:41.799> of<00:03:41.859> attacks<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.549> strings<00:03:42.880> while

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
sort of attacks on the strings while

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.030 
sort of attacks on the strings while
sort<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.959> keeping<00:03:44.380> everything<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.769> wrist

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
sort of keeping everything in the wrist

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.099 
sort of keeping everything in the wrist
you<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.459> slap<00:03:45.970> kind<00:03:46.359> of<00:03:46.450> thing<00:03:46.599> or<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> nice

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.970 

you<00:03:58.400> can<00:03:58.550> get<00:03:58.670> some<00:03:58.819> kind<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.090> shuffle<00:03:59.420> ething

going on so that's and then and then

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.630 
going on so that's and then and then
just<00:04:03.170> exposing<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:03.830> note<00:04:04.010> when<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.190> want<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.459> bass

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
just exposing a note when I want to bass

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.089 
just exposing a note when I want to bass
note<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.090> then<00:04:05.319> muting<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.349> note<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.920> can

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
note and then muting the note you can

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.070 
note and then muting the note you can
even<00:04:07.250> get<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> sound<00:04:07.700> by<00:04:08.000> doing<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.330> right<00:04:08.810> or

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
even get a sound by doing this right or

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.250 
even get a sound by doing this right or
two<00:04:09.260> sounds<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:10.099> three<00:04:10.400> sounds<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.959> combine

two sounds or three sounds and combine

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:24.100 
two sounds or three sounds and combine
it<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.070> sucky<00:04:19.730> go<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:22.360> yeah<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.389> suppose<00:04:23.510> that's

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
it so sucky go and yeah I suppose that's

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.010 
it so sucky go and yeah I suppose that's
quite<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.979> complex<00:04:25.310> percussion<00:04:25.880> pattern<00:04:26.210> but

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
quite a complex percussion pattern but

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.990 
quite a complex percussion pattern but
we<00:04:27.280> haven't<00:04:28.280> really<00:04:28.370> touched<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.760> anything

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
we haven't really touched on anything

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.930 
we haven't really touched on anything
musical<00:04:30.070> note<00:04:31.070> wise<00:04:31.370> we<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.790> got<00:04:31.910> this

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
musical note wise we just got this

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:42.550 
musical note wise we just got this
bassline<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:36.080> can<00:04:36.229> add<00:04:36.350> some<00:04:36.530> top<00:04:36.800> end<00:04:41.560> this

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
bassline so we can add some top end this

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.080 
bassline so we can add some top end this
will<00:04:42.889> do<00:04:43.040> okay

played<00:04:56.000> by<00:04:56.710> yep<00:04:57.710> these<00:04:57.890> two<00:04:58.070> notes<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:58.970> we

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
played by yep these two notes so if we

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.150 
played by yep these two notes so if we
get<00:04:59.180> these<00:04:59.330> two<00:04:59.510> notes<00:04:59.690> ringing<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.890> an<00:05:01.010> A

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
get these two notes ringing it's an A

get these two notes ringing it's an A
and<00:05:01.460> E<00:05:01.700> I'm<00:05:02.000> actually<00:05:02.150> tuned<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.630> semitone<00:05:02.930> down

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
and E I'm actually tuned a semitone down

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.580 
and E I'm actually tuned a semitone down
but<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.890> essentially<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.430> dadgad<00:05:04.880> tuning<00:05:05.330> I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
but I'm essentially in dadgad tuning I

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.490 
but I'm essentially in dadgad tuning I
can't<00:05:06.590> pick<00:05:06.919> this<00:05:07.660> at<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.870> same<00:05:09.050> time<00:05:09.320> as

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
can't pick this at the same time as

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.090 
can't pick this at the same time as
getting<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.890> bass<00:05:10.100> drum<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.820> decent<00:05:11.210> attack

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
getting a bass drum and a decent attack

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.250 
getting a bass drum and a decent attack
that<00:05:13.100> will<00:05:13.250> set<00:05:13.460> me<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.789> motion<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.960> do<00:05:15.080> my

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
that will set me in motion to do my

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.870 
that will set me in motion to do my
little<00:05:15.530> wrist<00:05:16.370> movement<00:05:17.229> right<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:18.950> how<00:05:19.820> can

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
little wrist movement right so how can

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.469 
little wrist movement right so how can
we<00:05:20.150> pick<00:05:20.360> these<00:05:20.600> notes<00:05:21.400> whilst<00:05:22.400> doing<00:05:23.270> these

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
we pick these notes whilst doing these

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.219 
we pick these notes whilst doing these
but<00:05:24.220> making<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.340> aggressive<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.240> this<00:05:26.960> angle

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
but making it aggressive and this angle

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.390 
but making it aggressive and this angle
this<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:27.889> much<00:05:28.039> detail

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
this is so much detail

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.620 
this is so much detail
um<00:05:29.350> I'm<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.410> big<00:05:30.740> nerd<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:31.520> I<00:05:31.550> do<00:05:32.000> this<00:05:32.360> regularly

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
um I'm a big nerd so I do this regularly

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.379 
um I'm a big nerd so I do this regularly
we<00:05:33.410> could<00:05:33.650> achieve<00:05:33.979> this<00:05:34.430> note<00:05:34.700> by<00:05:34.970> pulling

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
we could achieve this note by pulling

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.700 
we could achieve this note by pulling
off<00:05:35.510> all<00:05:35.750> right<00:05:35.900> we<00:05:35.960> could<00:05:36.050> start<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.500> phrase

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
off all right we could start the phrase

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:45.910 
off all right we could start the phrase
with<00:05:36.889> our<00:05:36.979> finger<00:05:37.280> actually<00:05:37.430> on<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.910> fret

phrase out of it funky stuff would you
say<00:06:01.320> that<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.620> key<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:01.860> learning<00:06:02.610> these<00:06:02.910> kind

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
say that the key to learning these kind

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.780 
say that the key to learning these kind
of<00:06:03.210> things<00:06:03.480> star<00:06:03.720> techniques<00:06:04.080> is<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:05.490> break

on things like that you know building up
from<00:06:25.110> from<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.890> ground<00:06:26.160> and<00:06:27.080> making<00:06:28.080> it<00:06:28.260> so

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
from from the ground and making it so

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.080 
from from the ground and making it so
the<00:06:28.530> listener<00:06:28.860> can<00:06:29.100> take<00:06:29.490> away<00:06:29.790> easily

this really simple little double stop

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.060 
this really simple little double stop
thing<00:06:39.320> that<00:06:40.320> would<00:06:40.440> almost<00:06:40.590> be<00:06:40.830> another

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
thing that would almost be another

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.910 
thing that would almost be another
industry<00:06:41.430> in<00:06:41.670> the<00:06:41.760> band<00:06:41.940> right<00:06:42.810> and<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.770> bass

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
industry in the band right and the bass

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:54.999 
industry in the band right and the bass
line<00:06:44.130> would<00:06:44.250> move<00:06:44.400> around<00:06:44.550> a<00:06:44.700> bit

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.950 

a<00:06:55.029> little<00:06:56.029> DJ<00:06:56.270> scratch<00:06:57.400> thing<00:06:58.400> you<00:06:58.610> know<00:06:58.960> yeah

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
a little DJ scratch thing you know yeah

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.469 
a little DJ scratch thing you know yeah
so<00:07:00.589> I<00:07:00.949> try<00:07:01.789> and<00:07:01.819> think<00:07:01.939> of<00:07:02.119> the<00:07:02.210> different

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
so I try and think of the different

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.029 
so I try and think of the different
parts<00:07:02.749> as<00:07:02.900> different<00:07:03.469> instruments<00:07:03.949> and

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
parts as different instruments and

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.329 
parts as different instruments and
different<00:07:04.189> players<00:07:04.719> a<00:07:05.719> good<00:07:06.680> example<00:07:07.099> of<00:07:07.159> this

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:07.339 
different players a good example of this

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:09.129 
different players a good example of this
is<00:07:07.520> actually<00:07:07.669> the<00:07:08.059> song<00:07:08.330> somebody<00:07:08.719> that<00:07:09.080> I

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
is actually the song somebody that I

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.920 
is actually the song somebody that I
used<00:07:09.169> to<00:07:09.680> know<00:07:09.770> by<00:07:10.219> God<00:07:10.430> Shay<00:07:10.669> I<00:07:10.909> did<00:07:11.659> a<00:07:11.689> cover

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
used to know by God Shay I did a cover

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.329 
used to know by God Shay I did a cover
of<00:07:12.080> it<00:07:12.229> but<00:07:12.529> that<00:07:12.559> song<00:07:15.159> illustrates<00:07:16.159> the<00:07:16.309> way

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:16.339 
of it but that song illustrates the way

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:17.859 
of it but that song illustrates the way
that<00:07:16.580> I<00:07:16.639> like<00:07:16.819> to<00:07:16.939> work<00:07:17.059> in<00:07:17.270> it<00:07:17.389> in<00:07:17.539> a<00:07:17.659> very

00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:17.869 
that I like to work in it in a very

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.469 
that I like to work in it in a very
clear<00:07:18.379> way<00:07:18.699> because<00:07:19.699> it<00:07:19.819> sort<00:07:19.939> of<00:07:20.029> directly

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
clear way because it sort of directly

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.149 
clear way because it sort of directly
related<00:07:20.899> to<00:07:20.930> the<00:07:21.080> way<00:07:21.229> gotcha

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:22.159 
related to the way gotcha

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.589 
related to the way gotcha
or<00:07:22.219> wall-e<00:07:22.639> works<00:07:24.009> in<00:07:25.009> building<00:07:25.969> layers<00:07:26.180> you

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 
or wall-e works in building layers you

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:28.389 
or wall-e works in building layers you
know<00:07:26.719> he'd<00:07:27.169> work<00:07:27.409> by<00:07:27.649> taking<00:07:27.830> a<00:07:28.009> sample<00:07:28.370> of

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:28.399 
know he'd work by taking a sample of

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.619 
know he'd work by taking a sample of
something<00:07:28.639> and<00:07:28.879> adding<00:07:29.089> a<00:07:29.149> base<00:07:29.300> part<00:07:29.569> and

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:29.629 
something and adding a base part and

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740 
this so the parts are very well defined

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.670 
this so the parts are very well defined
