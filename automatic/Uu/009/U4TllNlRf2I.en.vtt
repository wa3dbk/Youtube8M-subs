00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
thermaltake has also been nice enough to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.840 
thermaltake has also been nice enough to
include<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.670> nice<00:01:32.350> 120<00:01:33.350> millimeter<00:01:33.800> blue<00:01:34.369> LED

fan<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.990> probably<00:01:36.320> can't<00:01:36.619> see<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.830> there<00:01:37.070> but

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
fan you probably can't see it there but

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.250 
fan you probably can't see it there but
it<00:01:37.310> does<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> pretty<00:01:38.000> decent<00:01:38.450> job<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.660> shining

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
it does a pretty decent job of shining

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.040 
it does a pretty decent job of shining
through<00:01:39.500> without<00:01:39.680> being<00:01:40.010> blinding<00:01:40.870> they<00:01:41.870> also

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
through without being blinding they also

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.080 
through without being blinding they also
have<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:43.120> nice<00:01:44.560> design<00:01:45.640> instead<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.760> just<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
have a nice design instead of just a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.020 
have a nice design instead of just a
flat<00:01:47.420> front<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.620> little<00:01:48.860> odd<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.430> it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
flat front it's a little odd but it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.960 
flat front it's a little odd but it
really<00:01:50.240> helps<00:01:50.540> pull<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.900> look<00:01:51.050> together<00:01:51.970> what

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
really helps pull the look together what

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.149 
really helps pull the look together what
otherwise<00:01:53.500> when<00:01:54.500> you're<00:01:54.650> working<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:55.040> this

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
otherwise when you're working on this

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.520 
otherwise when you're working on this
case<00:01:55.460> you're<00:01:56.300> going<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.510> have<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.930> take<00:01:57.409> the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
case you're going to have to take the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.450 
case you're going to have to take the
front<00:01:57.740> off<00:01:58.000> because<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.510> sides<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.130> front

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
front off because the sides on the front

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.070 
front off because the sides on the front
will<00:02:01.730> prop<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.180> up<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.480> make<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:02.930> bit

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
will prop it up and make it a little bit

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.390 
will prop it up and make it a little bit
more<00:02:03.200> difficult<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.620> work<00:02:03.830> into<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.340> said

most<00:03:49.980> cases<00:03:50.310> because<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.269> support<00:03:51.840> isn't

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019

have to juggle this with one hand and
hope<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.579> get<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.849> screws<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.509> right

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.020 
and slide the rack out and then you

into<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.479> cage<00:04:34.159> this<00:04:35.159> would<00:04:35.340> be<00:04:35.490> easy<00:04:35.789> if<00:04:36.060> it

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
into the cage this would be easy if it

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.209 
into the cage this would be easy if it
wasn't<00:04:37.169> for<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.380> fact<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.710> these<00:04:37.919> screws

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
wasn't for the fact that these screws

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.520 
wasn't for the fact that these screws
have<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:38.639> in<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.030> deep<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:39.539> you're<00:04:40.320> going<00:04:40.469> to

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
have to go in so deep so you're going to

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.959 
have to go in so deep so you're going to
have<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.800> fiddle<00:04:41.099> with<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.340> flashlight<00:04:41.699> and

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
have to fiddle with a flashlight and

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.640 
have to fiddle with a flashlight and
hope<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.270> god<00:04:42.539> your<00:04:42.840> screwdriver<00:04:43.259> aligns

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
hope to god your screwdriver aligns

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.469 
hope to god your screwdriver aligns
properly<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.400> don't<00:04:44.580> strip<00:04:44.880> anything<00:04:45.300> or

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
properly and you don't strip anything or

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.060 
properly and you don't strip anything or
break<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> scruff<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.229> your<00:04:46.469> hard<00:04:46.650> drive<00:04:46.889> which

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
break a scruff and your hard drive which

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.070 
break a scruff and your hard drive which
I<00:04:47.310> have<00:04:47.880> done<00:04:48.090> before<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.570> let<00:04:48.719> me<00:04:48.780> tell<00:04:48.960> you

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
I have done before and let me tell you

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.670 
I have done before and let me tell you
it's<00:04:49.229> not<00:04:49.380> fun<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:51.330> what<00:04:51.870> I'd<00:04:51.960> advise<00:04:52.320> is

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
it's not fun so what I'd advise is

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.170 
it's not fun so what I'd advise is
thermaltake<00:04:53.280> include<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.699> magnetic

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
thermaltake include a magnetic

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.700 
thermaltake include a magnetic
screwdriver<00:04:54.389> or<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:55.020> go<00:04:55.169> out<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.440> get<00:04:55.529> your

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
screwdriver or you go out and get your

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.170 
screwdriver or you go out and get your
own<00:04:55.740> magnetic<00:04:56.190> screwdriver<00:04:56.490> because<00:04:57.090> it

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
own magnetic screwdriver because it

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.899 
own magnetic screwdriver because it
makes<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.719> so<00:04:58.080> much<00:04:58.229> easier<00:04:58.639> but<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.669> great

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
makes it so much easier but a great

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:00.650 
makes it so much easier but a great
thing<00:05:00.120> about<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
thing about the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.050 
thing about the
Rack<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.250> can<00:05:02.430> place<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:02.970> anywhere

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
Rack is that you can place it anywhere

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.330 
Rack is that you can place it anywhere
so<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.080> you're<00:05:04.200> running<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.530> bigger<00:05:04.770> card<00:05:05.100> like

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
so if you're running a bigger card like

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.460 
so if you're running a bigger card like
the<00:05:05.520> 26<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:07.260> 260<00:05:07.860> or<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.670> 280<00:05:09.450> from<00:05:09.990> Nvidia

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
the 26 the 260 or the 280 from Nvidia

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.040 
the 26 the 260 or the 280 from Nvidia
you<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.640> easily<00:05:12.210> get<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.510> line<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:12.960> can

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
you can easily get it a line so you can

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.050 
you can easily get it a line so you can
fit<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.500> bigger<00:05:13.710> cards<00:05:14.160> but<00:05:14.850> if<00:05:14.940> you're

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
fit the bigger cards but if you're

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.600 
fit the bigger cards but if you're
running<00:05:15.180> one<00:05:15.420> of<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.600> older<00:05:15.870> 8800<00:05:16.830> or<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:18.590> 4700

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
running one of the older 8800 or a 4700

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.630 
running one of the older 8800 or a 4700
there's<00:05:20.610> not<00:05:21.480> really<00:05:21.720> any<00:05:22.380> problems<00:05:22.890> with

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
there's not really any problems with

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.980 
there's not really any problems with
those<00:05:23.880> card<00:05:24.180> series<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.850> two<00:05:27.240> lists<00:05:27.600> design

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
those card series the two lists design

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.140 
those card series the two lists design
for<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.320> back<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.770> nowhere<00:05:29.550> near<00:05:29.730> as<00:05:29.820> good<00:05:29.850> as

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
for the back is nowhere near as good as

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.890 
for the back is nowhere near as good as
for<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.420> front<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.740> expansion<00:05:32.580> tulus<00:05:33.060> slots

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
for the front the expansion tulus slots

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.770 
for the front the expansion tulus slots
are<00:05:34.200> pretty<00:05:34.890> poorly<00:05:35.190> designed<00:05:35.460> and<00:05:35.940> I<00:05:36.510> advise

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
are pretty poorly designed and I advise

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.840 
are pretty poorly designed and I advise
just<00:05:37.080> removing<00:05:37.440> them<00:05:37.650> as<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:38.250> did<00:05:38.460> which<00:05:38.820> is

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
just removing them as I did which is

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.520 
just removing them as I did which is
pretty<00:05:39.120> simple<00:05:39.450> there's<00:05:39.780> three<00:05:40.080> screws<00:05:40.320> on

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
pretty simple there's three screws on

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.620 
pretty simple there's three screws on
the<00:05:40.560> back<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.040> then<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.280> just<00:05:41.520> pop<00:05:42.450> the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
the back and then you just pop the

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.850 
the back and then you just pop the
bracket<00:05:42.990> out<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.260> you're<00:05:43.350> good<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.530> go<00:05:45.860> other

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
bracket out and you're good to go other

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.310 
bracket out and you're good to go other
than<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.580> cable<00:05:48.510> management<00:05:48.690> being<00:05:49.230> a

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
than that and cable management being a

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.070 
than that and cable management being a
pain<00:05:49.590> there's<00:05:50.490> not<00:05:50.640> really<00:05:50.700> much<00:05:51.120> room<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.480> put

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
pain there's not really much room to put

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.840 
pain there's not really much room to put
the<00:05:52.170> cables<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.710> back<00:05:52.920> because<00:05:53.370> it's<00:05:53.670> a

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
the cables in the back because it's a

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.680 
the cables in the back because it's a
really<00:05:54.060> tight<00:05:54.390> fit<00:05:54.750> but<00:05:55.520> you<00:05:56.520> can<00:05:56.700> still<00:05:56.940> make

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
really tight fit but you can still make

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.960 
really tight fit but you can still make
a<00:05:57.720> workable<00:05:58.200> layout<00:05:59.190> if<00:05:59.430> you<00:06:00.240> plan<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.780> ahead

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
a workable layout if you plan it ahead

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.330 
a workable layout if you plan it ahead
the<00:06:02.970> steel<00:06:03.780> is<00:06:03.990> again<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.530> little<00:06:04.830> flimsy<00:06:05.040> but

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
the steel is again a little flimsy but

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.340 
the steel is again a little flimsy but
it's<00:06:05.490> still<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.760> lot<00:06:06.120> stronger<00:06:06.450> than<00:06:06.690> cases

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
it's still a lot stronger than cases

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.950 
it's still a lot stronger than cases
I've<00:06:07.470> seen<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:07.800> this<00:06:07.920> price<00:06:08.190> range<00:06:08.220> so<00:06:08.960> that's

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
I've seen in this price range so that's

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.550 
I've seen in this price range so that's
not<00:06:10.110> really<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.560> problem<00:06:11.840> however<00:06:12.840> sometimes

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
not really a problem however sometimes

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.640 
not really a problem however sometimes
because<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.730> steel<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.540> cage<00:06:15.840> the

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
because of the steel and the cage the

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.440 
because of the steel and the cage the
fan<00:06:16.890> can<00:06:17.130> start<00:06:17.400> rattling<00:06:17.730> and<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.150> can<00:06:18.300> be<00:06:18.330> a

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
fan can start rattling and it can be a

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.810 
fan can start rattling and it can be a
little<00:06:18.720> bit<00:06:18.900> irritating<00:06:19.470> so<00:06:20.280> you<00:06:20.370> might<00:06:20.580> want

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
little bit irritating so you might want

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.810 
little bit irritating so you might want
to<00:06:20.910> swap<00:06:21.450> in<00:06:21.630> different<00:06:22.020> fans<00:06:22.290> or<00:06:22.650> pad<00:06:23.550> your

to swap in different fans or pad your

that big an issue and the temperatures
managed<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.160> be<00:06:32.250> pretty<00:06:32.520> low<00:06:32.760> the<00:06:32.970> fan<00:06:33.210> shroud

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
managed to be pretty low the fan shroud

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.380 
managed to be pretty low the fan shroud
manages<00:06:34.470> to<00:06:34.620> get<00:06:34.740> enough<00:06:35.040> hot<00:06:35.520> air<00:06:35.550> dissipated

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
manages to get enough hot air dissipated

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.810 
manages to get enough hot air dissipated
and<00:06:36.510> these<00:06:37.260> two<00:06:37.620> fans<00:06:37.980> have<00:06:38.430> pretty<00:06:38.700> good

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
and these two fans have pretty good

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.940 
and these two fans have pretty good
circulation<00:06:39.200> there's<00:06:40.200> also<00:06:40.380> vents<00:06:40.770> in<00:06:40.860> the

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
circulation there's also vents in the

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.070 
circulation there's also vents in the
back<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.340> dissipate<00:06:41.850> a<00:06:41.910> hot<00:06:42.419> air<00:06:42.630> away<00:06:42.870> from

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
back to dissipate a hot air away from

back to dissipate a hot air away from
the<00:06:43.169> motherboard<00:06:43.620> so<00:06:44.370> overall<00:06:44.790> the<00:06:44.940> case<00:06:45.120> has

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
the motherboard so overall the case has

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.510 
the motherboard so overall the case has
a<00:06:45.360> pretty<00:06:45.780> good<00:06:45.870> design<00:06:46.470> there's<00:06:47.250> just<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.490> few

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
a pretty good design there's just a few

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.190 
a pretty good design there's just a few
problems<00:06:47.940> I'd<00:06:48.240> like<00:06:48.390> to<00:06:48.540> see<00:06:48.690> thermaltake
