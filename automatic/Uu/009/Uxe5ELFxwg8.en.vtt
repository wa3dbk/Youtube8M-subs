00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.319
 what little step they were hoping that well 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.040
 name leonardo is the one with gamer pc 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.090
 Welcome to a new gta 5 gameplay 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.850
 Well, here we are in a new challenge 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 of gta 5 said they will locate this 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.580
 I do not know what it's called, but I 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.460
 they sent say a picture a suv 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 on the train track and try to locate 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.610
 the ones that can most and fuck the moment 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.610
 what is this 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.060
 there is the idiot I do not know what he did 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.070
 but good as it floats in the air 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.200
 well I told them try to locate all 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.750
 this kind of way because the truth is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.820
 that pretty heavy 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.350
 you can not get one and handle it 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.600
 they will see that when they play a car like 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.300
 that destroy it so this one that 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.330
 supposedly all steel and we're going to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 see if the train is trying so that it does not 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.020
 be doing something like the game is 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.360
 I work something like that 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.340
 if something paranormal comes back if we are going to see 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.290
 I do not know what will happen but I wait for the train 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.450
 I can 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.390
 you are stopping or doing something though 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.740
 story mode because the train seems not to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.410
 it stops him absolutely nothing anymore what 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.910
 tried with many things including with 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.560
 tanks but I think they looked at 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.020
 uploaded but good I'll try to 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.760
 upload it and good but this weighs pretty 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.640
 not almost like a tank and the truth is 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.920
 which is quite quite heavy and as n 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.750
 they are about 50 more or less of those costs 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.060
 they did not fit anymore as they occupy all the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.740
 life of the train and well I hope you like it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.720
 that challenge and well there comes the train so 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.110
 that we see there after this 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.110
 slaughter 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.810
 and good guys but they liked this 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.970
 good challenge I do not know what's called this 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.920
 truck versus train for like in the train 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 or again as it was expected to be won 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.610
 but good the truth that I liked 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.220
 quite see how these are destroyed 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.940
 cars and work treated as of 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.380
 work on entering the train but good 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.590
