00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.960
 in the morning to blame it the program that goes 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.210
 mess with your head 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.310
 Hi , welcome to the program, sending the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.330
 is the program that will work with your 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.490
 head 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.130
 today we are going to explain what history is 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.200
 this one of gymnastics to the brain what 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.329
 means that how can you 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.030
 do exercises for the brain 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.070
 now everyone knows that if you stay 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.940
 worrying about your smile with your 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.960
 body 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.149
 but if your brain does not work 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.030
 right of what use 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.129
 so it's important to know how I 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.390
 I can use my brain to keep 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.030
 quality of life 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.699
 for example when are we going to do 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.510
 and we used several devices in the 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.519
 Academy 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.739
 We are working each of the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.649
 our muscles each of the parts of the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.780
 our body and brain is no different 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.629
 we also have to use each of the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.060
 skills and meshes correctly 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.340
 and is there a way to do this 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.500
 also for the brain like I said we 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.740
 we use various tools to work 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.079
 the various neural connections are 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.579
 pathways that the brain creates to 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.320
 to understand things 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.689
 during the day to day we realize 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.180
 various tasks and you must have a 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.579
 brain to do this to 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.799
 keep the focus on objectivity 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.619
 speed reasoning your 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.439
 relationship and everything else depends on a 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.960
 brain that works correctly the base 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.570
 Brain exercise is new to 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.210
 variety and the increasing challenge 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.079
 you offer this type of food to 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.479
 your brain 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.539
 So that is our proposal to propose 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.049
 of the method overcomes stimulating your brain 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.950
 systematically pleasant and 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.070
 harmonious 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.049
 our basis is neuroscience in the next 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 I'll explain the program to you. 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.810
 you what is this 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.020
 so you increase your capacity 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.719
 your relationships better 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.330
 your self-esteem and also your 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.090
 ability to focus objectivity and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.640
 speed of reason people now 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.520
 let's see a super important tip given 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.680
 Thank you, Professor Dani. 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.100
 which is the exercise for the brain I 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.210
 I'll be back in a little while 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.830
 your brain from day to day 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.480
 Hi, your brand of the year and come to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 you a little bit on the basis of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.190
 theory of brain exercise as 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.170
 hutchinson has commented on the theory base 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.390
 of brain exercise is new and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 variety and constant challenge what is 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.770
 novelty for our brain is to make 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 things we do not really do 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.810
 watch a different movie listen to a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.380
 different music eat a food 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.550
 different experiences 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.670
 many different 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.100
 the variety is to do something that we do 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.810
 day to day in a routine way 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.200
 in a different way 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.080
 so if you're schooling your teeth 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.970
 with your right hand try 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.920
 brush your teeth with your left hand 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 if you take the same route as the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.370
 work usually try to change 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.410
 the way this variety and challenge the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.540
 challenge is to do activities whose level of 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.550
 difficulty and increases throughout the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.310
 time in the brain is the same 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.440
 it works this way so if you are 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.650
 a person who likes to make sudokus 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.690
 my suggestion is to change from simple sudoku 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.420
 for the medium and then the medium for 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.620
 this is difficult to do gymnastics for 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.780
 brain 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.110
 if you offer to your brain 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.210
 novelty variety and increasing challenge 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.980
 You'll certainly enjoy the 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.610
 benefits of brain fitness in your 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.770
 life 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.840
 let's watch now a testimonial from a 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.150
 of our students who habitually 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.820
 do cerebral gymnastics enjoy the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.100
 benefits of brain gymnastics in 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.210
 day to day activities I 'm sure 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.210
 What are you going to like? 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.390
 I knew from a bag with 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.040
 My school is good when I come like this. 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.280
 School first time I did not understand much 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.919
 well she knew it was a thing of beads and 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.960
 I started taking the course and started to see 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.970
 that this in my life was influenced 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 too was a very good thing for me I 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.919
 had a deficiency in concentration I 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.980
 it was not too long that I was 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.340
 doing the time I went doing hope I had 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.130
 an effort like this has to work harder 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.050
 so over time you will learn the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.820
 to have a very great attention is 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.040
 doing you do not ask for attention with a 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.660
 side that was running next to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.950
 when you pay more attention to what 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.380
 you're doing 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.560
 It's very good because because you 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.840
 It matters to us that we are interested only in the new 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.389
 only soon if interested you will well 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.770
 in school is if that 's how it works 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.870
 I recommend that I think it's one thing 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.610
 very good for me was very good and that is 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.150
 good for me that I recommend friends 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.729
 huh 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.130
 I've already been waiting five years . 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.740
 I do not want to stop because it's for me. 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.110
 being very good until today is something that 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.760
 for me so my ability to 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.820
 learning will improve by improving 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.050
 On top of that, I'm going to kiss you. 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.150
 me is very good 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 The challenge of the week is really cool, people 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.720
 to know how our brains work is 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.340
 very interesting 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.229
 now we'll match that our 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.870
 brain a little more our brain 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.080
 with the challenge of the week this is the challenge 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.830
 of toothpicks we have 24 countries here 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.810
 what is the challenge remove without basics 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.990
 to form three squares 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.909
 note and remove be chosen to 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.860
 three squares if you do not 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.990
 managed to note that there is no problem 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.000
 challenge is on our site at the time of 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.909
 Excel or facebook 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.099
 Reply to this topic 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.870
 we will draw three people who 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.750
 They won a beautiful toast waiting moment. 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.490
 next week I say result of the 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.979
 challenge for you're 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.110
 meanwhile only look to do guilt 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.520
 exercise at home and up to the 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.159
 next program with more news 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.020
 about with our brain works 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.849
 looking at the blame his program is on 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.849
 ground with your head, bye 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:37.190
 the maianga cuca the program that will stir 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.190
 with your head
