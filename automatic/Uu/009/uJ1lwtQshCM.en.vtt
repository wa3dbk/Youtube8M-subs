00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.450
 with our spoons 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.229

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.479
 four bits on this beech have already tried 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.490
 put another flash drive it after 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.789

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.039
 re-create all partitions and see with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.610
 This flash drive error appears or not here 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.700
 we had an error of heights 004 seems blue 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.700
 screen 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.209
 Well, here we have this error again immediately 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.299

 yes here and on 4 variants now 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.200
 we will solve the window here this laptop on 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
 which could not put the seven he 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.500
 would fall a hundred somehow stuck on him 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.650
 eight 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.360
 but the problem still remained with him 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.299
 specifically the problem that it turns on 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.069
 one time you can turn it off then while it 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.410
 five minutes does not stand it does not start 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.840
 that is, it is specifically an iron problem 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.670
 this particular model and those settings 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.579
 which we did originally with you in 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.730
 bios and if you have a laptop without any problems 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:42.139
 you and seven and eight stand without 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.250
 superfluous blue screens like all of us 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:47.799
