00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
Hey what is up guys Jeremy here and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.550 
Hey what is up guys Jeremy here and
welcome<00:00:03.149> back<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.659> another<00:00:03.929> tweaked<00:00:04.290> video

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
welcome back to another tweaked video

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.059 
welcome back to another tweaked video
we're<00:00:05.040> taking<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.670> at<00:00:05.940> No<00:00:06.509> More

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
we're taking a look at No More

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:23.050 
we're taking a look at No More
separators

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.540 

so<00:00:24.060> no<00:00:24.480> more<00:00:24.689> separators<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> very

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so no more separators is actually a very

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.159 
so no more separators is actually a very
simple<00:00:26.939> tweak<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> does<00:00:27.839> make<00:00:28.050> your

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
simple tweak but it does make your

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.560 
simple tweak but it does make your
device<00:00:28.500> look<00:00:28.829> I<00:00:29.039> think<00:00:29.489> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.029> better<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
device look I think a lot better with it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
device look I think a lot better with it
installed<00:00:31.079> so<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> settings

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
installed so if we go into the settings

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
installed so if we go into the settings
application<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.750> guys<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.140> all<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
application as you guys can see all of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.280 
application as you guys can see all of
these<00:00:34.769> separator<00:00:35.280> lines<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
these separator lines that's kind of you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.500 
these separator lines that's kind of you
know<00:00:37.409> separating<00:00:38.070> each<00:00:38.300> settings<00:00:39.300> pane

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
know separating each settings pane

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.799 
know separating each settings pane
basically<00:00:40.019> our<00:00:40.339> or<00:00:41.339> is<00:00:41.519> removed<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.479> it<00:00:42.600> gives

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
basically our or is removed and it gives

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.719 
basically our or is removed and it gives
it<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> very<00:00:43.019> clean<00:00:43.769> look<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> guys<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.670> see

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
it a very clean look as you guys can see

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.910 
it a very clean look as you guys can see
I<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.449> way<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.720> this<00:00:45.920> makes

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I really like the way that this makes

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.829 
I really like the way that this makes
you<00:00:47.159> know<00:00:47.309> settings<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.659> very

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
you know settings look it's just a very

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.520 
you know settings look it's just a very
clean<00:00:49.140> look<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.890> does<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.610> other

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
clean look it does work on other

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.960 
clean look it does work on other
applications<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.129> device<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.790> like

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
applications on your device as well like

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.030 
applications on your device as well like
if<00:00:54.089> we<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.299> into<00:00:54.479> the<00:00:54.689> clock<00:00:54.900> here<00:00:55.140> into<00:00:55.890> all

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
if we go into the clock here into all

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.710 
if we go into the clock here into all
these<00:00:56.159> random<00:00:56.430> alarms<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.150> I<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.360> set<00:00:57.570> as

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
these random alarms that I have set as

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.899 
these random alarms that I have set as
you<00:00:57.839> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:58.350> no<00:00:58.790> separator<00:00:59.790> lines

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
you can see there's no separator lines

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.210 
you can see there's no separator lines
there<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.509> well<00:01:00.720> it'll<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:01.650> work<00:01:01.799> in<00:01:02.070> your

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
there as well it'll also work in your

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.740 
there as well it'll also work in your
messages<00:01:02.759> app<00:01:02.909> so<00:01:03.119> it's<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.390> remove<00:01:03.600> all

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
messages app so it's gonna remove all

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.170 
messages app so it's gonna remove all
those<00:01:03.900> separator<00:01:04.409> lines<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> basically<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
those separator lines so basically it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.109 
those separator lines so basically it
works<00:01:06.329> throughout<00:01:07.159> your<00:01:08.159> stock<00:01:08.549> iOS

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
works throughout your stock iOS

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.499 
works throughout your stock iOS

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
apps but like I said you know just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
apps but like I said you know just
removing<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:20.939> separator<00:01:21.390> lines<00:01:21.799> for

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
removing these separator lines for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.230 
removing these separator lines for
instance<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.399> settings<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.090> gives

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
instance here in settings it just gives

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.540 
instance here in settings it just gives
it<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.570> much<00:01:24.990> cleaner<00:01:25.320> look<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.860> fuel<00:01:26.190> all

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
it a much cleaner look and fuel all

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.000 
it a much cleaner look and fuel all
