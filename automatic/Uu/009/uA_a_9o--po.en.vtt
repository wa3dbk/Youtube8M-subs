when<00:00:32.150> i<00:00:32.239> tried<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.540> mentality<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.290> swinging

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
when i tried the mentality of swinging

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.680 
when i tried the mentality of swinging
up<00:00:33.950> i<00:00:34.160> was<00:00:34.430> consistently<00:00:35.030> thinning<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.480> ball

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
up i was consistently thinning the ball

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.430 
up i was consistently thinning the ball
and<00:00:35.960> our<00:00:36.170> topping<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:36.710> right<00:00:36.890> into<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.190> ground

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
and our topping it right into the ground

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.689 
and our topping it right into the ground
ok<00:00:39.440> that's<00:00:39.710> not<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:39.920> good<00:00:40.100> thing<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.370> be<00:00:40.550> doing

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
ok that's not a good thing to be doing

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.280 
ok that's not a good thing to be doing
so<00:00:41.000> let's<00:00:41.239> see<00:00:41.330> if<00:00:41.420> we<00:00:41.510> can't<00:00:41.720> fix<00:00:41.900> that<00:00:42.019> out

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
so let's see if we can't fix that out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.670 
so let's see if we can't fix that out
Robert<00:00:43.250> F<00:00:43.370> came<00:00:43.580> back<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.530> responded<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.590> that

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
Robert F came back and responded to that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.500 
Robert F came back and responded to that
and<00:00:45.830> said<00:00:45.980> most<00:00:46.640> likely<00:00:46.760> you're<00:00:47.120> jumping

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
and said most likely you're jumping

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.790 
and said most likely you're jumping
forward<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.989> losing<00:00:48.260> your<00:00:48.379> spine<00:00:48.620> angle

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
forward and losing your spine angle

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.369 
forward and losing your spine angle
before<00:00:49.010> impact<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.930> ocular<00:00:50.930> swing<00:00:51.170> in<00:00:51.350> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
before impact the ocular swing in the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.110 
before impact the ocular swing in the
area<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.769> ball<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.160> not<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.550> much<00:00:52.730> different

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
area the ball is not that much different

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.940 
area the ball is not that much different
from<00:00:53.149> a<00:00:53.270> rotational<00:00:53.629> swing<00:00:54.050> except<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:54.829> it

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
from a rotational swing except that it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.440 
from a rotational swing except that it
doesn't<00:00:55.219> go<00:00:55.309> as<00:00:55.489> deeply<00:00:55.760> into<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.059> ground<00:00:56.300> it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
doesn't go as deeply into the ground it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.209 
doesn't go as deeply into the ground it
stays<00:00:56.660> relatively<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.469> target<00:00:57.739> line<00:00:57.980> for<00:00:58.190> a

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
stays relatively on a target line for a

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.959 
stays relatively on a target line for a
longer<00:00:58.430> time<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.809> poptart<00:01:00.320> AFAP<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.309> after

longer time the poptart AFAP is after

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.380 
longer time the poptart AFAP is after
impact<00:01:02.329> if<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.860> pop<00:01:04.100> top<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.339> for<00:01:04.640> impact<00:01:05.000> you

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
impact if you pop top a for impact you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.180 
impact if you pop top a for impact you
will<00:01:05.509> top<00:01:05.690> it<00:01:05.720> in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.110> ball<00:01:06.259> much<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.800> time

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.400 

okay<00:01:10.190> that's<00:01:10.820> that's<00:01:11.180> one<00:01:11.479> good<00:01:11.720> possibility

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
okay that's that's one good possibility

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.150 
okay that's that's one good possibility
again<00:01:12.979> somebody<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:15.410> could<00:01:15.590> be<00:01:15.710> taken<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
again somebody you could be taken to the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.180 
again somebody you could be taken to the
point<00:01:16.430> where<00:01:16.580> where<00:01:17.420> as<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:19.280> said<00:01:19.720> you're

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
point where where as you said you're

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.560 
point where where as you said you're
using<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.759> mentality<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.270> swinging

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
using the the mentality of swinging

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.690 
using the the mentality of swinging
up<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.259> if<00:01:24.410> you're<00:01:24.530> swinging<00:01:25.069> up<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.369> standing

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
up so if you're swinging up and standing

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.180 
up so if you're swinging up and standing
up<00:01:25.819> too<00:01:26.000> soon<00:01:26.349> then<00:01:27.349> that's<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> big<00:01:28.039> problem

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
up too soon then that's the big problem

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.219 
up too soon then that's the big problem
you<00:01:28.459> can<00:01:28.610> top<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:28.789> all<00:01:29.000> day<00:01:29.209> I<00:01:29.509> mean<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.080> can

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
you can top it all day I mean I can

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.249 
you can top it all day I mean I can
stand<00:01:30.410> he<00:01:30.619> right<00:01:30.800> there<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.330> if<00:01:33.050> I

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
stand he right there and and and if I

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.440 
stand he right there and and and if I
start<00:01:33.560> if<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.830> from<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.369> top<00:01:34.550> I<00:01:34.729> start<00:01:35.030> swinging

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
start if I from the top I start swinging

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.699 
start if I from the top I start swinging
up<00:01:35.569> but<00:01:35.990> I'm<00:01:36.080> also<00:01:36.470> standing<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.099> too<00:01:37.280> soon<00:01:37.520> I

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
up but I'm also standing up too soon I

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.630 
up but I'm also standing up too soon I
can<00:01:39.709> top<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:39.890> too<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.920> can<00:01:43.039> top<00:01:43.220> it<00:01:43.250> really

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
can top it too and you can top it really

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.520 
can top it too and you can top it really
badly<00:01:43.849> if<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.149> stand<00:01:44.390> up<00:01:44.599> if<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.170> stand<00:01:45.380> up

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
badly if you stand up if you stand up

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.790 
badly if you stand up if you stand up
and<00:01:45.649> fall<00:01:45.890> backwards<00:01:46.340> at<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.520> same<00:01:46.729> time

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
and fall backwards at the same time

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.650 
and fall backwards at the same time
alright<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.190> fall<00:01:49.429> backwards<00:01:49.670> are<00:01:50.390> you

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
alright and you fall backwards are you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.330 
alright and you fall backwards are you
see<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.500> stand<00:01:51.739> up<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.099> get<00:01:52.160> too

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
see if you if you stand up and get too

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.979 
see if you if you stand up and get too
far<00:01:52.520> ahead<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:52.940> ball<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.720> can<00:01:53.899> actually

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
far ahead of the ball you can actually

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.479 
far ahead of the ball you can actually
you<00:01:54.289> could<00:01:54.410> probably<00:01:54.649> hit<00:01:54.800> him<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.340> could

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
you could probably hit him you could

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:56.889 
you could probably hit him you could
probably<00:01:55.670> hit<00:01:55.819> him<00:01:55.940> way<00:01:56.030> left<00:01:56.330> or<00:01:56.479> anywhere<00:01:56.780> if

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
probably hit him way left or anywhere if

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.359 
probably hit him way left or anywhere if
you<00:01:57.020> stay<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.319> you<00:01:57.410> start<00:01:57.649> standing<00:01:57.860> up<00:01:58.039> and

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
you stay if you start standing up and

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.529 
you stay if you start standing up and
get<00:01:58.550> over<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.819> top<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.209> ball<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.479> that

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
get over the top of the ball like that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.779 
get over the top of the ball like that
you<00:01:59.780> might<00:01:59.899> fall<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.289> way<00:02:00.349> so<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.640> whole

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
you might fall that way so the whole

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.199 
you might fall that way so the whole
thing<00:02:02.569> comes<00:02:02.810> down<00:02:02.989> to<00:02:03.170> what<00:02:03.759> you're<00:02:04.759> changing

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
thing comes down to what you're changing

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.270 
thing comes down to what you're changing
your<00:02:05.330> spine<00:02:05.630> angle<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.709> think<00:02:06.950> that's<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
your spine angle and I think that's the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.130 
your spine angle and I think that's the
big<00:02:07.459> issue<00:02:07.489> because<00:02:07.789> sometimes<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:08.899> take

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
big issue because sometimes we we take

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.410 
big issue because sometimes we we take
the<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:09.679> take<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> lot<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.670> we<00:02:10.789> want<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> do<00:02:11.209> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the we take a lot that we want to do and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.380 
the we take a lot that we want to do and
we<00:02:11.870> overdo<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.700> whole<00:02:13.819> key<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
we overdo it and the whole key is is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.240 
we overdo it and the whole key is is
that<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:15.020> opens<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.530> whole<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.220> whole

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that that opens up a whole the whole

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.089 
that that opens up a whole the whole
bunch<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.000> other<00:02:17.120> cans<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.720> problems<00:02:18.349> alright

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
bunch of other cans of problems alright

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.949 
bunch of other cans of problems alright
so<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.760> key<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.209> once<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.690> into<00:02:20.840> your

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
so the key is is once you get into your

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.050 
so the key is is once you get into your
posture<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.650> you're<00:02:22.069> standing<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.640> even

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
posture and you're standing in and even

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.550 
posture and you're standing in and even
though<00:02:23.209> I'm<00:02:23.300> swinging<00:02:23.780> up<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.349> have<00:02:24.530> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
though I'm swinging up you have to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.110 
though I'm swinging up you have to
maintain<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:25.250> spine<00:02:25.550> angle<00:02:25.730> till<00:02:26.000> impact

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
maintain your spine angle till impact

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.360 
maintain your spine angle till impact
the<00:02:26.900> spine<00:02:27.230> can't<00:02:27.500> go<00:02:27.620> up<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:27.920> down<00:02:28.040> backwards

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the spine can't go up and down backwards

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
the spine can't go up and down backwards
a<00:02:28.640> forward<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.030> any<00:02:29.120> combination<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.750> those

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
a forward or any combination of those

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.800 
a forward or any combination of those
issues<00:02:30.260> alright<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.580> once<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:32.330> get<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.540> here

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
issues alright so once we get to here

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.340 
issues alright so once we get to here
and<00:02:33.020> we

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
and we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.650 
and we
here<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.830> mean<00:02:34.130> I'm<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.460> my<00:02:34.910> spine<00:02:35.180> angle<00:02:35.330> stays

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
here I mean I'm in my spine angle stays

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660 
here I mean I'm in my spine angle stays
the<00:02:35.840> same<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.320> even<00:02:37.010> though<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.280> starting<00:02:37.640> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the same so even though I'm starting to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.520 
the same so even though I'm starting to
swing<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.300> here<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.840> swinging<00:02:39.320> up<00:02:39.410> with

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
swing up from here I'm swinging up with

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.380 
swing up from here I'm swinging up with
a<00:02:39.590> sense<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.890> from<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:40.430> my<00:02:40.820> whole<00:02:41.000> goal<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
a sense that from here my whole goal is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
a sense that from here my whole goal is
so<00:02:41.480> they<00:02:41.570> show<00:02:41.750> my<00:02:41.870> arms<00:02:42.080> swing<00:02:42.800> up<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.160> my

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
so they show my arms swing up and my

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.030 
so they show my arms swing up and my
body<00:02:43.670> chases<00:02:44.180> my<00:02:44.300> arms<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.870> finish<00:02:45.200> but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
body chases my arms up to the finish but

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.680 
body chases my arms up to the finish but
that<00:02:46.220> chase<00:02:46.490> doesn't<00:02:46.820> really<00:02:47.090> happen<00:02:47.330> till

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
that chase doesn't really happen till

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.260 
that chase doesn't really happen till
that<00:02:47.840> till<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.860> split<00:02:49.250> second<00:02:49.700> at<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.120> after

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
that till that split second at and after

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.220 
that till that split second at and after
impact<00:02:50.720> alright<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.750> stay<00:02:53.990> in

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
impact alright so you have to stay in

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.810 
impact alright so you have to stay in
yet<00:02:54.410> she<00:02:54.590> into<00:02:54.860> your<00:02:54.980> spine<00:02:55.220> angle<00:02:55.400> all<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
yet she into your spine angle all the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.470 
yet she into your spine angle all the
way<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.190> way<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.370> impact<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.210> when<00:02:59.390> you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
way all the way to impact so when you

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.090 
way all the way to impact so when you
see<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.780> you're<00:02:59.990> going<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.140> come<00:03:00.320> up<00:03:00.470> did<00:03:00.950> you

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
see that you're going to come up did you

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.070 
see that you're going to come up did you
do<00:03:01.250> your<00:03:01.370> bump<00:03:01.610> your<00:03:01.730> steer<00:03:02.030> into<00:03:02.180> impact<00:03:02.540> you

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
do your bump your steer into impact you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.130 
do your bump your steer into impact you
hit<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.440> ball<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.920> ball<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.760> struck<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.300> then

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
hit the ball the ball is struck and then

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.870 
hit the ball the ball is struck and then
everything<00:03:06.800> stands<00:03:07.040> up<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.340> finish<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
everything stands up to the finish and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.910 
everything stands up to the finish and
that<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.230> be<00:03:09.380> kind<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:09.890> guess

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
that so that would be kind of I guess

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.040 
that so that would be kind of I guess
what<00:03:10.280> we<00:03:10.370> call<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:11.150> timing<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> proper

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
what we call the timing the proper

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.330 
what we call the timing the proper
sequence<00:03:12.200> will<00:03:12.560> move<00:03:12.710> into<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> parts<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
sequence will move into the parts of the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.780 
sequence will move into the parts of the
body<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.140> as<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.260> suspect<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.920> think<00:03:16.160> your

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
body and as I suspect I think your

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.060 
body and as I suspect I think your
timing<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.270> often<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.680> second

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
timing is often that that the second

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.740 
timing is often that that the second
you're<00:03:19.160> starting<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.550> swing<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:19.910> AFAP<00:03:20.510> you're

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
you're starting to swing up AFAP you're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.720 
you're starting to swing up AFAP you're
already<00:03:20.990> standing<00:03:21.260> up<00:03:21.560> which<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.130> lifting

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
already standing up which is lifting

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.400 
already standing up which is lifting
your<00:03:22.820> spine<00:03:23.030> out<00:03:23.240> so<00:03:23.390> yes<00:03:23.600> we<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.200> keep

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
your spine out so yes we have to keep

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.470 
your spine out so yes we have to keep
the<00:03:24.560> spine<00:03:24.800> in<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.130> shot<00:03:25.430> till<00:03:25.640> impact<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.390> if

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
the spine in the shot till impact and if

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.400 
the spine in the shot till impact and if
you<00:03:26.570> do<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:28.210> that's<00:03:29.210> what<00:03:29.390> happens<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.380> that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
you do that that's what happens and that

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.020 
you do that that's what happens and that
was<00:03:30.710> that<00:03:31.010> was<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.310> good<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.730> gets<00:03:31.850> i

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
was that was as good as it gets i

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.990 
was that was as good as it gets i
couldn't<00:03:32.300> hit<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.450> ball<00:03:32.630> better<00:03:32.810> than<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.140> one

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
couldn't hit a ball better than that one

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.680 
couldn't hit a ball better than that one
and<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.790> maintain<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> spine<00:03:38.150> angle<00:03:38.330> till

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and so maintain a spine angle till

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.020 
and so maintain a spine angle till
impact<00:03:38.810> even<00:03:39.770> though<00:03:39.920> I'm<00:03:40.040> swinging<00:03:40.430> up<00:03:40.550> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
impact even though I'm swinging up the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.540 
impact even though I'm swinging up the
whole<00:03:41.180> goal<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.110> hear<00:03:42.380> but<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.980> don't

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
whole goal is to get to hear but I don't

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.300 
whole goal is to get to hear but I don't
I<00:03:43.760> don't<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:45.230> can't<00:03:45.470> really<00:03:45.800> start<00:03:46.010> standing

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
I don't you can't really start standing

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.430 
I don't you can't really start standing
up<00:03:46.550> until<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.030> first<00:03:47.300> struck<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> ball<00:03:47.810> again

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
up until you first struck the ball again

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.350 
up until you first struck the ball again
think<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:48.890> this<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> string<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.850> in

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
think of it that this is a string and in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.140 
think of it that this is a string and in
this<00:03:50.960> is<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:51.890> rock<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.940> swing

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
this is the rock and this is the swing

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.970 
this is the rock and this is the swing
all<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.390> way<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.600> here<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.230> here's<00:03:54.470> my<00:03:54.620> center

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
all the way to here and here's my center

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.670 
all the way to here and here's my center
of<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.190> swing<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.670> if<00:03:56.090> if<00:03:56.960> this<00:03:57.230> rock<00:03:57.500> is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
of the swing and if if this rock is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.010 
of the swing and if if this rock is
going<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.070> stay<00:03:58.250> consistent<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:59.060> reach<00:03:59.780> that

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
going to stay consistent and reach that

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.110 
going to stay consistent and reach that
ball<00:04:00.080> this<00:04:00.650> can't<00:04:00.950> be<00:04:01.040> moving<00:04:01.430> around<00:04:01.520> one<00:04:01.940> way

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
ball this can't be moving around one way

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.700 
ball this can't be moving around one way
back<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.720> forth<00:04:02.870> up<00:04:03.050> or<00:04:03.200> down<00:04:03.350> or<00:04:03.380> whatever

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
back and forth up or down or whatever

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.980 
back and forth up or down or whatever
this<00:04:04.250> has<00:04:04.520> to<00:04:04.700> stay<00:04:04.880> steady<00:04:05.210> you<00:04:05.750> want<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
this has to stay steady you want to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.090 
this has to stay steady you want to
think<00:04:06.080> about<00:04:06.170> this<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:06.530> want<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.860> think<00:04:07.010> about

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
think about this you want to think about

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.380 
think about this you want to think about
your<00:04:07.310> spine<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.730> want<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> think<00:04:08.060> about<00:04:08.150> your

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
your spine you want to think about your

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.250 
your spine you want to think about your
head<00:04:08.510> if<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.660> tie<00:04:08.900> them<00:04:08.990> all<00:04:09.140> together

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
head if you tie them all together

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.400 
head if you tie them all together
whatever<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.480> have<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:11.960> keep<00:04:12.230> this

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
whatever it is you you have to keep this

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.620 
whatever it is you you have to keep this
point<00:04:12.710> levels<00:04:13.490> to<00:04:13.580> that<00:04:13.730> so<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.240> if<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.450> had<00:04:14.570> a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
point levels to that so that if I had a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.300 
point levels to that so that if I had a
rock<00:04:14.870> here<00:04:15.140> on<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.380> string<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.070> was<00:04:16.160> swinging

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
rock here on a string and I was swinging

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.620 
rock here on a string and I was swinging
it<00:04:16.520> was<00:04:16.640> just<00:04:16.820> touching<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.150> ground<00:04:17.299> if<00:04:17.540> I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
it was just touching the ground if I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.390 
it was just touching the ground if I
stop<00:04:17.870> moving<00:04:18.170> my<00:04:18.200> hand<00:04:18.590> which<00:04:19.160> would<00:04:19.280> be

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
stop moving my hand which would be

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.830 
stop moving my hand which would be
consistent<00:04:19.730> what<00:04:20.030> we're<00:04:20.150> calling<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.540> top<00:04:20.720> of

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
consistent what we're calling the top of

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.960 
consistent what we're calling the top of
my<00:04:20.960> spine<00:04:21.260> here<00:04:21.470> if<00:04:21.770> I<00:04:22.040> stop<00:04:22.280> moving<00:04:22.550> at<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.730> go

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
my spine here if I stop moving at I go

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.850 
my spine here if I stop moving at I go
down<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.600> rock<00:04:23.990> bounces<00:04:24.380> off<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.530> ground

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
down to the rock bounces off the ground

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.620 
down to the rock bounces off the ground
I<00:04:24.980> lift<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.250> up<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:25.520> bit<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.910> boxes<00:04:26.480> right

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
I lift it up a little bit it boxes right

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.970 
I lift it up a little bit it boxes right
all<00:04:26.780> right<00:04:27.050> above<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> ground<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.740> don't<00:04:27.890> even

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
all right above the ground it don't even

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.540 
all right above the ground it don't even
touch<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:29.920> rock<00:04:30.920> on<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.160> end<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
touch it and so rock on the end of the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.740 
touch it and so rock on the end of the
string<00:04:31.790> where<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.000> got<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.210> keep<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.450> center

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
string where you got to keep the center

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.440 
string where you got to keep the center
the<00:04:33.230> center<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.830> rotation<00:04:34.190> here<00:04:34.550> very

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
the center of the rotation here very

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.780 
the center of the rotation here very
very<00:04:35.660> still<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.080> stable<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:37.070> at<00:04:37.190> least<00:04:37.310> impact

you start hitting him solid straight and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.520 
you start hitting him solid straight and
shooting<00:04:44.060> those<00:04:44.150> low<00:04:44.270> scores<00:04:44.600> that's<00:04:45.350> it<00:04:45.500> for
