I'm<00:04:42.870> pretty<00:04:43.290> sure<00:04:43.440> good<00:04:43.710> ten<00:04:43.950> questions

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
I'm pretty sure good ten questions

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.400

you're<00:04:45.150> all<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> same<00:04:45.480> questions<00:04:45.900> why<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.380> it

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
you're all the same questions why can it

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.890 
you're all the same questions why can it
negate<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:48.720> hopefully

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
negate this this and that so hopefully

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.409 
negate this this and that so hopefully
I've<00:04:49.440> explained<00:04:50.040> or<00:04:50.580> not<00:04:50.850> really<00:04:51.210> need<00:04:51.330> to

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
I've explained or not really need to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.890 
explain to show you the cards that it
can<00:04:53.340> be<00:04:53.460> gate<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:54.180> hopefully<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.720> work

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
can be gate and hopefully you can work

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.070 
can be gate and hopefully you can work
out<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.139> rest<00:04:55.290> for<00:04:55.620> yourself<00:04:56.780> solemn<00:04:57.780> warning

in<00:04:58.230> a<00:04:58.290> way<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.710> little<00:04:59.100> bit<00:04:59.190> better<00:04:59.280> than

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
in a way is a little bit better than

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.950 
in a way is a little bit better than
solemn<00:04:59.820> judgment<00:05:00.210> because<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.600> can<00:05:00.840> negate
