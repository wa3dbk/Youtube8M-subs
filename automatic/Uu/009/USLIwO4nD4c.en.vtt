give him some likes on this he also does
some<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.320> cool<00:00:55.620> pixel<00:00:56.070> art<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:57.059> we're

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
some really cool pixel art which we're

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
some really cool pixel art which we're
going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.510> take<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going to go take a look at here in a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
going to go take a look at here in a
second<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.730> didn't<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> show<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
second but I didn't want to show you the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.369 
second but I didn't want to show you the
circuitry<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:02.719> down<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> bottom

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
circuitry that down there on the bottom

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.490 
circuitry that down there on the bottom
it's<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.070> my<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.549> putting<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.500> button

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it's just my way of putting in a button

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
it's just my way of putting in a button
operated<00:01:08.130> system<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> part<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
operated system so that's not part of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.580 
operated system so that's not part of
his<00:01:11.640> design<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.900> yeah<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> pretty

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
his design but yeah this is a pretty

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.460 
his design but yeah this is a pretty
slim<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> vault<00:01:17.880> door<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.259> main

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
slim for a vault door and the main

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
slim for a vault door and the main
reason<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.850> done

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
reason why is because the way it's done

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.690 
reason why is because the way it's done
and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> really<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> way

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and I got to say I really like the way

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
and I got to say I really like the way
he<00:01:23.970> used<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.420> stack<00:01:24.960> double<00:01:25.500> piston

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
he used the stack double piston

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
he used the stack double piston
extenders<00:01:26.369> which<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.960> hard

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
extenders which is actually really hard

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.310 
extenders which is actually really hard
to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.619> he's<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.079> three

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to do he's got actually two or three

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.649 
to do he's got actually two or three
block<00:01:31.560> updates<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.960> c12<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.799> block<00:01:35.040> updates

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
block updates here c12 to block updates

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
block updates here c12 to block updates
he's<00:01:36.659> actually<00:01:36.900> preventing<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> block<00:01:38.189> update

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
he's actually preventing a block update

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.590 
he's actually preventing a block update
here<00:01:40.040> by<00:01:41.040> having<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> repeater<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
here by having the repeater in this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.319 
here by having the repeater in this
fashion<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> doesn't<00:01:44.880> update<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
fashion that way this doesn't update and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
fashion that way this doesn't update and
that's<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.630> makes<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.290> vault<00:01:46.680> doors<00:01:46.950> really

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that's what makes a vault doors really

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.580 
that's what makes a vault doors really
tricky<00:01:50.360> yeah<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.689> cool<00:01:51.990> i<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.200> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tricky yeah really cool i really like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.789 
tricky yeah really cool i really like
the<00:01:52.770> design<00:01:53.180> yeah<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:55.320> happy<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> see

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the design yeah I'm really happy to see

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.590 
the design yeah I'm really happy to see
leggy<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.680> PVR<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.610> so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
leggy actually do and get a PVR going so

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
leggy actually do and get a PVR going so
let's<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.869> look<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> pixel<00:02:01.979> art

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
let's go look at some of the pixel art

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.270 
let's go look at some of the pixel art
he<00:02:02.340> did<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.850> map

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.120 

already<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:09.970> we<00:02:10.119> are<00:02:10.240> on<00:02:10.509> my<00:02:11.130> sandstone

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
already so here we are on my sandstone

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.490 
already so here we are on my sandstone
map<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.880> my<00:02:13.030> redstone<00:02:13.350> Cathedral<00:02:14.350> in<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
map with my redstone Cathedral in the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.800 
map with my redstone Cathedral in the
center<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:15.970> done<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> couple

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
center now I have done a couple

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.760 
center now I have done a couple
tutorials<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.070> but<00:02:19.380> yeah<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
tutorials in here but yeah this is the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.010 
tutorials in here but yeah this is the
structure<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.520> love<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.910> structure<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
structure I just love the structure and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.040 
structure I just love the structure and
so<00:02:23.200> when<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.350> was<00:02:23.500> making<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.240> leggy<00:02:25.240> offered<00:02:25.840> to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
so when I was making it leggy offered to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.230 
so when I was making it leggy offered to
do<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:27.910> pixel<00:02:28.300> art<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.760> he<00:02:30.760> actually<00:02:30.910> did

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
do some pixel art and so he actually did

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.510 
do some pixel art and so he actually did
these<00:02:31.390> repeaters<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.560> recorded<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
these repeaters now I recorded this

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.550 
these repeaters now I recorded this
previously<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.360> could<00:02:34.570> not<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.500> I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
previously and you could not see it so I

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.180 
previously and you could not see it so I
lift<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.010> area<00:02:36.520> up<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> let's<00:02:38.350> take<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.830> look

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
lift this area up so let's take a look

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.000 
lift this area up so let's take a look
at<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.140> look<00:02:41.320> at<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.560> really

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
at it so if you look at it really

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.800 
at it so if you look at it really
doesn't<00:02:42.280> look<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.610> much<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.360> back

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
doesn't look like much of it as you back

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.660 
doesn't look like much of it as you back
up<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.260> can<00:02:44.410> see<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:45.100> makes<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.550> nice

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
up you can see that it makes a nice

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.360 
up you can see that it makes a nice
shape<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.270> it's<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> three<00:02:47.500> dimensional<00:02:47.680> and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
shape and it's a three dimensional and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.880 
shape and it's a three dimensional and
use<00:02:49.300> some<00:02:49.570> half<00:02:49.810> slabs<00:02:50.200> while<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:50.739> making

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
use some half slabs while I was making

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.360 
use some half slabs while I was making
it<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:53.350> make<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.560> look<00:02:53.950> three-dimensional

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
it and to make it look three-dimensional

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.360 
it and to make it look three-dimensional
like<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.320> see<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.860> QB

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
like that like you can see it's like QB

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.470 
like that like you can see it's like QB
and<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.290> repeater<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and what it is is it's a repeater and I

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.320 
and what it is is it's a repeater and I
actually<00:03:01.690> watched<00:03:02.080> him<00:03:02.320> come<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:02.890> my<00:03:03.040> map

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
actually watched him come in on my map

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.550 
actually watched him come in on my map
and<00:03:04.330> he<00:03:04.600> put<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.489> repeater<00:03:06.489> like<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.530> took<00:03:08.530> a

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and he put a repeater like so and took a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.350 
and he put a repeater like so and took a
look<00:03:08.680> at<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.070> like<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:11.730> then<00:03:12.730> basically

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
look at it like this and then basically

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.270 
look at it like this and then basically
proceeded<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.350> make<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.860> there<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.190> you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
proceeded to make it up there and you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280 
proceeded to make it up there and you
can<00:03:15.430> see<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.730> up<00:03:16.090> close<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.690> really<00:03:17.019> doesn't

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
can see that up close it really doesn't

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
can see that up close it really doesn't
look<00:03:17.320> like<00:03:17.650> much<00:03:17.890> just<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.640> some<00:03:18.910> kind<00:03:19.180> of

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
look like much just like some kind of

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
look like much just like some kind of
blob<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.950> cool<00:03:21.220> thing<00:03:21.250> about

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
blob and that's the cool thing about

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.030 
blob and that's the cool thing about
pixel<00:03:22.060> art<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.410> basically<00:03:23.590> took<00:03:23.980> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
pixel art and so you basically took a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.380 
pixel art and so you basically took a
repeater<00:03:24.549> looked<00:03:24.880> at<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.299> a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
repeater looked at it in a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.620 
repeater looked at it in a
three-dimensional<00:03:25.750> form<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.630> then

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
three-dimensional form and then

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.500 
three-dimensional form and then
converted<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.299> see

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
converted it like that and you can see

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.090 
converted it like that and you can see
he's<00:03:31.660> got<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.959> dimensions<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.830> really

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
he's got the dimensions on it really

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.610 
he's got the dimensions on it really
nice<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.700> yeah<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.810> if<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.989> guys<00:03:35.110> could<00:03:35.320> do<00:03:35.470> me

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
know really appreciated him putting in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.420 
know really appreciated him putting in
these<00:03:59.620> repeaters<00:04:00.100> for<00:04:00.489> me<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:00.850> he<00:04:01.810> did<00:04:01.989> this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
these repeaters for me and he did this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.770 
these repeaters for me and he did this
it's<00:04:03.430> actually<00:04:03.640> redstone<00:04:04.360> when<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.660> in

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
it's actually redstone when it's in

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.180 
it's actually redstone when it's in
black<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.019> white<00:04:05.320> so<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.590> looks<00:04:05.769> more<00:04:05.890> like

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
black and white so it looks more like

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.819 
black and white so it looks more like
gunpowder<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.230> only<00:04:08.290> way<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.620> can

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
gunpowder but it's the only way you can

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.250 
gunpowder but it's the only way you can
really<00:04:08.890> do<00:04:09.340> redstone<00:04:09.989> because<00:04:10.989> we<00:04:11.110> don't

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
really do redstone because we don't

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.300 
really do redstone because we don't
actually<00:04:11.470> have<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:12.250> right<00:04:12.430> colors<00:04:12.850> yet<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:14.350> so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
actually have the right colors yet so so

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.890 
actually have the right colors yet so so
yeah<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.489> hope<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.970> guys<00:04:16.150> enjoyed<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:16.690> you
