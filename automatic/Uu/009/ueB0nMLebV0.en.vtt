00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.240 

you<00:00:01.319> know<00:00:01.410> some<00:00:01.620> of<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:01.770> photographs<00:00:01.949> that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
you know some of the photographs that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.039 
you know some of the photographs that
I'm<00:00:02.399> taking<00:00:02.520> out<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:02.879> Midway<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> be

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I'm taking out in Midway are going to be

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.900 
I'm taking out in Midway are going to be
kind<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.290> hard<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> believe<00:00:04.890> because<00:00:05.640> there's

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
kind of hard to believe because there's

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.330 
kind of hard to believe because there's
so<00:00:06.180> much<00:00:06.330> plastic<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.740> bodies<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> these

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
so much plastic in the bodies of these

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.440 
so much plastic in the bodies of these
albatross<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:10.849> think<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.389> be

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
albatross and I think it's going to be

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
albatross and I think it's going to be
easy<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.929> wonder<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:14.130> they've<00:00:14.429> been

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
easy to wonder if they've been

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.140 
easy to wonder if they've been
manipulated<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.900> cheated<00:00:16.230> by<00:00:17.039> adding<00:00:17.490> extra

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
manipulated if I cheated by adding extra

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
manipulated if I cheated by adding extra
plastic<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.890> something<00:00:20.220> actually

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
plastic and if something actually

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.429 
plastic and if something actually
thought<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> before<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> even<00:00:21.270> came<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.900> when

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
thought of before I even came here when

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.370 
thought of before I even came here when
I<00:00:22.500> saw<00:00:22.830> photographs<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.630> snapshots<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I saw photographs way the snapshots that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.370 
I saw photographs way the snapshots that
we've<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:25.619> seen<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.189> internet<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
we've all seen on that internet and I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
we've all seen on that internet and I
just<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.800> couldn't<00:00:29.130> help<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.340> wonder<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
just I couldn't help but wonder if the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
just I couldn't help but wonder if the
person<00:00:30.269> who<00:00:30.660> took<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> those<00:00:31.529> photographs

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
person who took one of those photographs

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.540 
person who took one of those photographs
might<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> added<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.050> plastic

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
might not have added a little plastic

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.510 
might not have added a little plastic
just<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> make<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> point<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> very

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
just to make a point and so when I very

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
just to make a point and so when I very
first<00:00:38.610> came<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.540> developed<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.559> ethic

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
first came here I developed an ethic

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
first came here I developed an ethic
with<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.550> teammates<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.660> agreed<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
with my teammates and we all agreed that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.260 
with my teammates and we all agreed that
every<00:00:44.129> single<00:00:44.309> photograph<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.059> took

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
every single photograph that we took

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
every single photograph that we took
would<00:00:45.539> follow<00:00:45.719> certain<00:00:46.379> rules<00:00:46.530> about

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
would follow certain rules about

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.860 
would follow certain rules about
manipulation<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> rules<00:00:48.690> were

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
manipulation here are the rules were

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
manipulation here are the rules were
following<00:00:49.460> first<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:51.030> no

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
following first of all there's no

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
following first of all there's no
plastic<00:00:51.960> that's<00:00:52.110> been<00:00:52.289> added<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> any

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
plastic that's been added to any

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.389 
plastic that's been added to any
photograph<00:00:53.989> even<00:00:54.989> though<00:00:55.110> there's

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
photograph even though there's

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
photograph even though there's
frequently<00:00:56.399> tons<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.879> plastic<00:00:57.000> around<00:00:57.379> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
frequently tons of plastic around that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.569 
frequently tons of plastic around that
would<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.710> easy<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.129> pick<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
would be really easy to pick up and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.549 
would be really easy to pick up and
bring<00:00:59.670> into<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> picture<00:01:00.390> we've<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.199> added<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bring into a picture we've not added a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
bring into a picture we've not added a
single<00:01:01.980> piece<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> plastic<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> any<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
single piece of plastic to any one of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.469 
single piece of plastic to any one of
the<00:01:03.629> photographs<00:01:03.809> we've<00:01:04.229> taken<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.479> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the photographs we've taken and the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.700 
the photographs we've taken and the
other<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> look<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
other thing that we do is look is that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.609 
other thing that we do is look is that
we<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.400> arrange<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.479> plastic<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
we don't arrange the plastic in the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
we don't arrange the plastic in the
photographs<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.490> there's<00:01:12.180> no<00:01:12.420> moving

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
photographs at all there's no moving

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.460 
photographs at all there's no moving
around<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.350> plastic<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
around of plastic so what you see in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
around of plastic so what you see in
terms<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> plastic<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> pictures<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
terms of the plastic in the pictures is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.080 
terms of the plastic in the pictures is
exactly<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.580> what<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.850> allow

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
exactly what was there what we do allow

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
exactly what was there what we do allow
ourselves<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> remove<00:01:22.439> things<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ourselves to do is to remove things and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
ourselves to do is to remove things and
so<00:01:24.180> sometimes<00:01:24.420> I'll<00:01:24.750> pull<00:01:24.900> away<00:01:24.990> some

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so sometimes I'll pull away some

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
so sometimes I'll pull away some
feathers<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.430> might<00:01:27.000> pull<00:01:27.210> away<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.540> breast

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
feathers I might pull away the breast

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.590 
feathers I might pull away the breast
bone<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> albatross<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.090> expose

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
its body cavity and I might pull away
some<00:01:34.860> plants<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.850> sometimes<00:01:36.180> grass

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
some plants because sometimes grass

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.910 
some plants because sometimes grass
grows<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.140> through<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.470> might<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
grows right up through there might be a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
grows right up through there might be a
branch<00:01:38.310> that's<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
branch that's right over the top of the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600
