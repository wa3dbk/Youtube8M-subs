00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.800
 hello and welcome to our seventh 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.230
 chapter of rebuilding the titanic in 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.349
 the minecraft good as you see I am here 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.680
 in the machinery area is worth the room 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.680
 machines 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.570
 good as you see 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 the titanic movie or many more of 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.140
 the titanic ones the good thing is that the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.180
 machine zone had an engines that 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.790
 they did this pretty much something like that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.790
 It is what I have done in these and in 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.030
 those this is really like it's 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.160
 the area of thermal light is worth having 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 the whole boat is worth the levers and everything 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 there 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.190
 and nothing 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.980
 just tell you that and one more thing 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.500
 ok to watch this video is going to be the last 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.480
 already of the titan and it's worth this will no longer be 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.030
 more continuations is going to be the last 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.860
 definitive, because I've finished it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.640
 on the outside, I put it on the inside 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.580
 cabins with beds boxes and I've even 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.530
 placed to characters worth I've put 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.049
 to human villagers is worth as you see those 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.840
 so everyone is out there all by 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.970
 there in cabins in other places it's worth it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.030
 how good you have done the river of what 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.670
 which is the estuary the dry dock is worth 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.880
 you see like that people go around and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 well tell you that nothing more so 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.940
 this is this titanic series I leave it 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 It's been a good thing to be doing 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.130
 the one that would not have continued being let's go 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.990

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.299

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.349
 well and if not then it's worth nothing to see this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.769
 series is worth doing with all my 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.470
 honey and my respect xd good so he has 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.120
 been all that for today for the titanic in 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.220
 the minecraft 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.590
 do it your way which you 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.140
 want to do 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.830
 good just one more tip if you want 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.040
 do what 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.110
 who wants to do it and is where you want 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 Do not want to rain because it's going to 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.710
 raining always has to rain some 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.540
 day in the minecraft 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.070
 mine advice is you to do the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 desert is as I told you in the first 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.930
 episode is what you do in the desert 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.370
 because it's going to rain there and in this 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.800
 case I did it here because it does not rain but 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.450
 I think how big it was is that I 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.300
 come up until the snowy come on 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.850
 by the hair it's worth but good only 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.880
 to say is that so good to keep seeing 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.810
 my videos of the commented cake fruits 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.810
 And until next time
