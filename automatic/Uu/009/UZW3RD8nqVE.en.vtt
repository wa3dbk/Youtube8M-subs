to trick me into choice band therefore I

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.520 
to trick me into choice band therefore I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
nasty plot again while I go for a fire

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.480 
nasty plot again while I go for a fire
blast<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.900> wasn't<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> bestest<00:02:06.100> move<00:02:06.310> he

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
blast that wasn't the bestest move he

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.550 
blast that wasn't the bestest move he
could<00:02:06.790> do<00:02:07.030> he<00:02:07.840> should<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.379> switched

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
could do he should have just switched

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.130 
could do he should have just switched
out<00:02:08.979> into<00:02:09.369> something<00:02:09.909> else<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.539> could<00:02:10.929> take

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
out into something else that could take

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.309 
out into something else that could take
the<00:02:11.379> fire<00:02:11.680> blast<00:02:11.980> with<00:02:12.489> relative<00:02:12.970> ease

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the fire blast with relative ease

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.420 
the fire blast with relative ease
however<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> didn't<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.159> take<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
however here I didn't want to take the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.429 
however here I didn't want to take the
risk<00:02:15.579> of<00:02:15.970> him<00:02:16.209> predicting<00:02:16.689> my<00:02:16.840> switch<00:02:17.170> back

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
risk of him predicting my switch back

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.710 
risk of him predicting my switch back
into<00:02:17.739> Celebi<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.549> for<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.879> flare<00:02:19.480> blitz

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
into Celebi and going for a flare blitz

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
into Celebi and going for a flare blitz
so<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.860> decided<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.519> let<00:02:21.909> my<00:02:22.060> heater<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
so I just decided to let my heater and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.260 
so I just decided to let my heater and
go<00:02:22.720> while<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.440> went<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> explosion<00:02:24.880> where

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
go while I went for the explosion where

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.600 
go while I went for the explosion where
he<00:02:25.450> may<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:26.140> he<00:02:26.470> /<00:02:26.620> predicted<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.280> went<00:02:27.459> for

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
he may be if he / predicted and went for

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.940 
he may be if he / predicted and went for
a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.860 
a
blast<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.209> have<00:02:29.300> been<00:02:29.450> too<00:02:29.629> bad

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
blast then it would have been too bad

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.210 
blast then it would have been too bad
for<00:02:30.110> him<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:31.250> now<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.580> go<00:02:31.819> into<00:02:32.060> my<00:02:33.220> elite

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
for him and now I go into my elite

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.920 
for him and now I go into my elite

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
Pokemon again because that the best

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
Pokemon again because that the best
thing<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.290> do<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.920> don't<00:02:37.879> want<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> go<00:02:38.269> for

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
thing I can do I don't want to go for

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.080 
thing I can do I don't want to go for
the<00:02:38.540> u-turn<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:40.010> had<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.280> go<00:02:40.519> for<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.819> zen

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
the u-turn so I just had to go for a zen

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.710 
the u-turn so I just had to go for a zen
head<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.569> um<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.580> does<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.819> pitiful<00:02:44.510> that

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
head but um but it does a pitiful that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720 
head but um but it does a pitiful that
much<00:02:44.840> do<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.260> sis<00:02:45.470> or<00:02:45.650> because<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.519> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
much do that sis or because of the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.000 
much do that sis or because of the
resistance<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.569> now<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> thought<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.860> really

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
resistance and now I thought I really

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
resistance and now I thought I really
thought<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.370> he<00:02:49.610> would<00:02:49.790> go<00:02:50.030> for<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> bullet

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
thought that he would go for a bullet

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.979 
thought that he would go for a bullet
punch<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:52.099> thought<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:52.970> my<00:02:53.150> defensive

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
punch and I thought that my defensive

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.630 
punch and I thought that my defensive
Celebi<00:02:54.290> could<00:02:54.620> take<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.040> bullet<00:02:55.400> brunch

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
Celebi could take this bullet brunch

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000 
Celebi could take this bullet brunch
with<00:02:55.910> relative<00:02:56.330> ease<00:02:56.569> however<00:02:57.349> he<00:02:57.560> goes<00:02:57.769> for<00:02:57.950> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
with relative ease however he goes for a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
with relative ease however he goes for a
bug<00:02:58.370> bite<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:58.970> really<00:02:59.390> didn't<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.840> that

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
Swampert if I was life or it might have

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.559

finished<00:04:12.500> him<00:04:12.709> off<00:04:12.889> birth<00:04:13.340> yeah<00:04:13.849> that's<00:04:14.480> just

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
finished him off birth yeah that's just

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.839 
finished him off birth yeah that's just
my<00:04:14.870> choice<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.319> running<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.799> as<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.250> leftover

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
my choice of running this as a leftover

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.259 
my choice of running this as a leftover
set<00:04:17.239> that's<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.260> because<00:04:18.380> many<00:04:19.160> people<00:04:19.269> will

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
set that's just because many people will

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.080 
set that's just because many people will
think<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.900> crow<00:04:21.139> Coon<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.849> yeah<00:04:22.849> I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
think that it is a crow Coon and yeah I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.570 
think that it is a crow Coon and yeah I
can't<00:04:23.300> play<00:04:23.479> mind<00:04:23.750> games<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.400> however<00:04:25.400> he

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
can't play mind games with it however he

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.070 
can't play mind games with it however he
gets<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.910> critical<00:04:26.270> hit<00:04:26.389> on<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.660> earthquake

gets a critical hit on the earthquake
which<00:04:27.289> I<00:04:27.440> would<00:04:27.650> have<00:04:27.740> survived<00:04:28.220> for<00:04:28.490> sure<00:04:28.729> and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
which I would have survived for sure and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.390 
which I would have survived for sure and
that<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:30.020> going<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.349> finish<00:04:30.500> off<00:04:30.680> my<00:04:30.860> suicune

now we switch off into my am realized my
flygon<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.690> i<00:04:48.350> decided<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.920> go<00:04:49.130> for<00:04:49.400> a

flygon and i decided to go for a
fireblast<00:04:50.060> straight<00:04:50.570> away<00:04:50.810> because<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.800> know<00:04:51.860> I

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
yet so basically i'm going to switch out

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.770 
yet so basically i'm going to switch out
and<00:05:09.890> leave<00:05:10.190> my<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.430> self<00:05:10.940> as<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.180> death<00:05:11.480> father

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
and leave my a self as a death father

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.060 
and leave my a self as a death father
because<00:05:12.590> i<00:05:12.620> didn't<00:05:13.070> know<00:05:13.160> what<00:05:13.340> kind<00:05:13.970> of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
because i didn't know what kind of

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.150 
because i didn't know what kind of
Infernape<00:05:16.070> this<00:05:16.280> was<00:05:16.490> i<00:05:17.260> thought<00:05:18.260> that<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.830> was

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
Infernape this was i thought that it was

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.180 
Infernape this was i thought that it was
life<00:05:19.910> orb<00:05:20.300> but<00:05:20.900> i<00:05:20.930> didn't<00:05:21.290> see<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.530> recoil

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
life orb but i didn't see the recoil

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.930 
life orb but i didn't see the recoil
damage<00:05:22.660> due<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.930> life<00:05:24.080> orb<00:05:24.410> so<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.250> thought

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
damage due to the life orb so I thought

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.820 
damage due to the life orb so I thought
it<00:05:26.090> might<00:05:26.120> be<00:05:26.480> choice<00:05:26.720> banded<00:05:27.080> because<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.590> have

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
it might be choice banded because I have

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.680 
it might be choice banded because I have
only<00:05:28.100> seen<00:05:28.220> physical<00:05:28.940> moves<00:05:29.180> up<00:05:29.420> to<00:05:29.450> this

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
only seen physical moves up to this

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.870
