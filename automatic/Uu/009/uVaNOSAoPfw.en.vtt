 cremant we tried to find out 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.830
 more 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.350
 Chapel 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.630
 it was the garden the vegetable garden of 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.950
 the bÃ©caud family who lived in the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.870
 little house here and it's at the window 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.640
 from the kitchen that it all started 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.940
 physically she sees here in the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.510
 garden a beautiful lady she always 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.930
 talked about a nice range gt all 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 bright full of light the beautiful lady 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.110
 or life easy to get out 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 Mariette wants to go to the door and 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.870
 Mom was locked and said this is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.839
 can be a witch so mariette did 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.399
 could not join the lady that night but 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.360
 Mariette is convinced that she saw 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:13.509
 marry the mother of jesus and she is going 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.450
 start praying Rosary 1 and 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.270
 from that night, well, she 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 will come out here 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 she will kneel and she will pray 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.850
 because she is convinced of the Labenne 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.659
 beware of music and she came back 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.150
 this time again this way and said it 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.790
 important things where pilgrims 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.030
 from banneux first she said that she 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.510
 and she said I am the virgin of 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.290
 poor I come to join us in 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.830
 this situation marie said I 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.540
 would like a little chapel so very 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 very quickly after the appearances 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.880
 we had this chapel built 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.600
 this was the main road for 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.119
 go from louvignÃ© to train this 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 was not a reserved road at all 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.380
 as it is now for pilgrims 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.900
 in time it was the way that all 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.470
 the world was taking on Thursday it's interesting 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.930
 also it is that navy in paris a way 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.810
 this is the way that the whole 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.470
 world took and she led the little one to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.940
 source 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 marry walk backwards so she is 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.860
 always remained turning to mariette 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.530
 like a mom who is learning to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.340
 walk to his child good I believe that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.160
 it's an invitation to trust that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.830
 mario addresses a wedding and mariette 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.950
 was all happy all happy with 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.510
 able to follow the beautiful friend while 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.380
 the first time did not know at all 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.330
 where the years but the important thing is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.330
 she trusted the call 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.860
 marc 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.709
 came to meet mariette 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.049
 becaud that was almost ten years old and 4 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.170
 points they went up the road for 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.719
 come here to this source it was very 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.650
 cold -12 degrees and so there was 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:58.620
 the ice on the source and marries to 10 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.180
 inches of hands in the water she had to 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.239
 push to break the ice 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.849
 and then he plunged his hands north 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.400
 so that's a bit of the gesture that all 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.790
 the pilgrims marie said this source 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.209
 is reserved for reynerie and the next day 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.269

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:23.759
 for the sick so suburb is 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.770

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.099
