00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.749
 we are even closer to the engines 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.820
 on the new hyundai santa fe and look 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.190
 how the infotainment display works from 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.260
 7 inch touchscreen 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.550
 therefore practically everything is commanded with 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 fm radio fingers obviously with 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.530
 the appropriate to tune up to 12 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.490
 preset there is the possibility to modify 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.300
 then manually of course the band e 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.089
 the frequency crushing that other 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.760
 left you can switch from fm to am e 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.100
 the list gives us all the stations that rds 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.379
 catch in the area where we are 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.359
 with these buttons you switch from radio to 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.969
 and subject multimedia sources 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.210
 multimedia there is a great possibility 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.350
 of choice for all the bluetooth the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.429
 system makes bluetooth streaming of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.920
 any source and it also shows us 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.699
 the title is the artist of the song not 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.280
 everyone does it 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.050
 if we go on cd the cd slips in here 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.760
 over it 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.870
 we find that I read normal acids either 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.060
 to mp3s 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.400
 however, we cannot display the traces 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.370
 by artist track author but only 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.330
 per folder so here we can go 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.920
 to choose the songs we like best 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.480
 as for the ipod instead 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.400
 it works quietly that we are 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.980
 using an iphone 5 does not work with 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.440
 we can almost all ipods 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.680
 go and read the albums and songs 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.170
 of the artists and also the playlists that 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.890
 we have on our ipod if we disconnect 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.510
 the ipod we have the last chance 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.770
 multimedia the one offered by 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.500
 USB pendrive 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 among other things there is also on the side 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.660
 auxiliary input to connect 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.430
 any analogue source the usb come 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.700
 read quietly but be careful 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.680
 do not load a key with a 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.060
 an apple mac because it will not come 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.810
 recognized due to charge the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.679
 key with a pc we test the quality 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.909
 of the audio we go with american women of 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.909
 lenny kravitz and turn up the volume 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.380
 then you heard how good the sounds 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.590
 system do n't have us on the version anymore 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.540
 equipped with santa fe which also has 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.880
 over whether so much speakers or subwoofers but 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.970
 the sound quality is really a lot 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.070
 very good we review instead the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.250
 navigation mode we have two 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.230
 enav map buttons mark the map on the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.840
 we display full screen with 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.310
 navigation of course we have the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.160
 possibility to enter the destination 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.840
 as the address the last destination la 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.080
 heading points of interest or 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.490
 look for a nearby parking in mode 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.500
 advanced we can also enter 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.250
 tour mode where we can insert a 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.209
 series of steps to create us our the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.680
 our journey 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.940
 enter the address with me 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.640
 seeing the Milan speed is fine 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.990
 we touch is there to turin 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.660
 enough understand us quite well i 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.459
 our commands even if it is a resistive e 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.440
 not a capacitive when we started of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.830
 start route calculation on 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.080
 navigator offers us three different ones 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.540
 paths now we are in a place a little 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.180
 far wins put a little to create the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.130
 path but as said this is the la 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.220
 first choice 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.010
 the fastest is the second the most 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.080
 the less distant we say and this is one 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.640
 choice to save fuel 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.890
 once we choose the path 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.470
 let's say start and he starts with the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.200
 navigation denial that works well 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.209
 2d or 3d view of the map 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.150
 we can have information on the route 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.640
 in this case the compass or have 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.959
 indications on the maneuvers that 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.670
 we have to do now we have not understood 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.640
 the navigation but here on the right if it were 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.400
 we would indicate the turns that 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.299
 we must do present acts along the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.880
 route 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.790
 you have seen the tmc information 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.100
 therefore with the possibility of 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.050
 manage an immediate detour on the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.980
 navigation path as 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.880
 regards the telephone part the 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.530
 bluetooth works works very well 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.730
 also this highway thanks also 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.160
 when the car is not installed 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.330
 We never had problems even the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.210
 bluetooth has never been released 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.080
 not much voice commands possible 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.700
 intuitive 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.140
 I advise you to study the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.720
 booklet because there are commands 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.130
 details to be imposed to use i 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.290
 voice commands for rest a 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.060
 infotainment that convinces that it works 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.020
 well thanks to this display from 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.020
 7 inches
