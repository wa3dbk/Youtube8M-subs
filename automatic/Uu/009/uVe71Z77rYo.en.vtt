00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 this from the plate here of one 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 table from 1920, he had years 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.500
 originally a filling with a 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 linoleum plate hung up 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.600
 Here I would like to do a research 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:26.279
 insert the plate before 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.060
 few if I look at it then is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.679
 just like this name and also 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.239
 This plate is easy to be felled 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.800
 and then just here a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.420
 screwed so with the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 original movie here is yes 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 he really hard to work with 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.920
 right now in the manual as fit too 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.289
 do 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.149
 who is very difficult or because if that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.239
 is already there, of course, only deeper 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 Now the plate is made 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 reasonably set because we have yes 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.030
 also nuts and even a milling machine 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.000
 if you would lead by hand now 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.570
 it is very difficult actually because 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 even the wood just not so 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.420
 right now it is different thick for it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.650
 is now just such a proposal 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 optimally which feed apparatus first 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.689
 think of something here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.659
 happens the rolls are moving 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.619
 Forward gives four different 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.619
 speeds 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.439
 and transport with pressure , so to speak 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.109
 and also in which this advance 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.530
 The bar here against the 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.950
 stop presses on this milling head 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.329
 You can pass this camera 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.819
 set exactly 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.170
 He also becomes so easy here 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.049
 put it diagonally that he really does 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.520
 great pressure against the increase is 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.000
 you can really do it in all 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.539
 possible directions so that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.390
 So the whole pressure of the apparatus on 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:14.400
 often the wood is the key 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.849
 get over 50 pounds heavy and can do that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.860
 So really perfect then here 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.950
 pass by without me there with the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 I would not only need to be at hand 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 to adjust this fund to us that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.970
 can not move anymore now must 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:37.200
 I have to ask here behind the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:45.420
 He does not break anymore now either 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.739
 these suggestions have 123456 one 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.180
 beautiful opportunity to take this 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.150
 can adjust exactly here for the height 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 here to completely swing here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.209
 to guide the driver and back there 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.910
 then the apparatus itself again 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.470
 Turning him to score points forward 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.290
 to tilt back and also again 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.910
 Tilt them sideways into all of them 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.579
 directions so happy to start now 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.650
 just slip on the surface here 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.650
 then the wood slides over it well 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:49.260
 then the proposal comes ready 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:04:04.049
 stand that between the first and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 second role of the router is and here 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.430
 the slight inclination so that too 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.280
 really is wood pressed off 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:20.970
 now I'll just check on whether the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:25.080
 Mills are free runs is clear all 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:30.210
 Parts of the stroke are stuck now 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:41.300
 everything is fixed from the research apparatus 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:44.970
 sit the suction is off 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:51.090
 The direction of the racer is also correct 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:55.740
 I have a photo now 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.330
 speed of 15 meters a minute 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.430
 set because it is hartz 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.310
 act there I am I go a bit 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.919
 faster through a little over one 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.590
 make changing and therefore his 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:14.479
 speed and constant now 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.479
 start sucking on 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.990
 Milled something breaks or flies 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.160
 Remember that here 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:07.130
 Adulterations are yours around that 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:10.450
 stop difficult session wood we look 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.450
 Let's do that from the bottom 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.770
 Of course, now many will share 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.960
 planing in relatively quick time for that 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.960
 is of course useful but optimal
