the least but I finally found a way to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.979 
the least but I finally found a way to
damage<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:45.090> made<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> big<00:00:46.270> mistake<00:00:46.329> which

damage it and I made a big mistake which

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
damage it and I made a big mistake which
was<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.469> had<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.620> problem<00:00:47.890> with<00:00:48.039> the<00:00:48.280> water<00:00:48.640> pump

the coolant last fall after I replaced
the<00:00:57.430> pump<00:00:57.699> I<00:00:58.059> was<00:00:58.329> testing<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:58.809> was<00:00:58.930> just

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
the pump I was testing it was just

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.610 
the pump I was testing it was just
straight<00:00:59.379> water<00:00:59.620> no<00:01:00.039> antifreeze<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:02.230> then

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
straight water no antifreeze and I then

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.680 
straight water no antifreeze and I then
blew<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.920> hydraulic<00:01:03.129> line<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.180> ended<00:01:04.420> up<00:01:04.540> just

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
blew a hydraulic line so I ended up just

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.200 
blew a hydraulic line so I ended up just
parking<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.170> machine<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.650> leaving<00:01:06.010> it<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:06.730> I

past<00:01:19.930> winter<00:01:20.200> from<00:01:20.470> what<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:20.650> consume<00:01:21.100> eyes<00:01:21.280> and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
past winter from what I consume eyes and

past winter from what I consume eyes and
now<00:01:22.329> I've<00:01:22.479> got<00:01:22.659> some<00:01:22.840> damage<00:01:23.079> my<00:01:23.829> radiator<00:01:24.430> has

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
now I've got some damage my radiator has

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.800 
now I've got some damage my radiator has
several<00:01:25.689> leaks<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.100> actually<00:01:27.250> see

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
several leaks in it you can actually see

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.289 
several leaks in it you can actually see
it's<00:01:28.810> still<00:01:29.140> showing<00:01:30.100> wet<00:01:30.520> from<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.939> top<00:01:31.119> and

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
it's still showing wet from the top and

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's still showing wet from the top and
it's<00:01:31.390> actually<00:01:31.659> been<00:01:31.810> raining<00:01:32.140> today<00:01:32.259> so<00:01:32.350> some

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's actually been raining today so some

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.740 
it's actually been raining today so some
of<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.130> rain<00:01:33.520> water<00:01:33.759> but<00:01:34.090> there's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
of that is rain water but there's

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.090 
of that is rain water but there's
actually<00:01:34.960> some<00:01:35.170> spots<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.770> there<00:01:35.920> that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
actually some spots in there that

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.700 
actually some spots in there that
clearly<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.390> water<00:01:37.600> was<00:01:37.810> leaking<00:01:38.170> out<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.350> so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
clearly the water was leaking out of so

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.920 
clearly the water was leaking out of so
I<00:01:38.740> know<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.100> I've<00:01:39.189> got<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.750> radiator<00:01:40.750> that's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
I know that I've got a radiator that's

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.649 
I know that I've got a radiator that's
going<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.110> need<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> be<00:01:41.439> record<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:43.240> at<00:01:43.509> least

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
going to need to be record or at least

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.920 
going to need to be record or at least
repaired<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:45.100> what<00:01:45.700> concerns<00:01:46.149> me<00:01:46.270> more<00:01:46.600> is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
repaired but what concerns me more is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.550 
repaired but what concerns me more is
that<00:01:46.960> when<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.290> top<00:01:47.560> off<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.040> cooling<00:01:48.460> system<00:01:48.909> I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that when I top off the cooling system I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.889 
that when I top off the cooling system I
get<00:01:50.560> water<00:01:50.829> coming<00:01:51.340> out<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.700> engine<00:01:52.090> out

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
get water coming out of the engine out

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.969 
get water coming out of the engine out
of<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.649> little<00:01:53.979> vent<00:01:54.219> line<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.950> here

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
of a little vent line which right here

of a little vent line which right here
where<00:01:57.250> my<00:01:57.280> finger<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.079> fuel<00:01:59.350> line

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
where my finger is this is the fuel line

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.859 
where my finger is this is the fuel line
that<00:02:00.789> comes<00:02:01.000> out<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:03.329> governor<00:02:04.329> fuel<00:02:04.600> pump

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
that comes out of the governor fuel pump

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.010 
that comes out of the governor fuel pump
assembly<00:02:05.110> here<00:02:05.950> comes<00:02:06.909> out<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.420> goes<00:02:07.600> into

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
finger is just to the right of that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.390 
finger is just to the right of that
right<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.140> another<00:02:14.290> small<00:02:14.890> line<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
right here there's another small line it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.170 
right here there's another small line it
looks<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> quarter-inch<00:02:16.180> metal<00:02:16.600> line

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
looks like a quarter-inch metal line

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.119 
looks like a quarter-inch metal line
comes<00:02:17.629> out<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.810> little<00:02:18.049> fitting<00:02:18.439> that<00:02:18.859> just

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
comes out a little fitting that just

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.890 
comes out a little fitting that just
goes<00:02:19.310> straight<00:02:19.489> down<00:02:19.730> behind<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.420> starter

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
goes straight down behind the starter

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.360 
goes straight down behind the starter
and<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.079> just<00:02:21.290> faces<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> ground<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.280> it's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
and it just faces the ground and it's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.910 
and it just faces the ground and it's
open<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.909> atmosphere<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:24.349> clearly<00:02:24.769> that's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
open to the atmosphere so clearly that's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.789 
open to the atmosphere so clearly that's
a<00:02:25.069> vent<00:02:25.340> or<00:02:25.579> some<00:02:26.569> sort<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.959> like

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
a vent or some sort of a like

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.470 
a vent or some sort of a like
condensation<00:02:28.579> drain<00:02:28.819> or<00:02:29.030> something<00:02:29.299> like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
condensation drain or something like

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.740 
condensation drain or something like
that<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:30.370> line<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:31.819> there<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.150> where<00:02:32.629> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
that that line right there is where the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.679 
that that line right there is where the
water<00:02:32.780> comes<00:02:33.439> out<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.939> I've<00:02:34.939> had<00:02:35.180> water<00:02:35.420> come

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
water comes out of I've had water come

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.449 
water comes out of I've had water come
out<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.170> spurts<00:02:36.590> before<00:02:37.099> but

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
out of there and spurts before but

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.369 
out of there and spurts before but
usually<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.299> attributed<00:02:38.989> that<00:02:39.019> to

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
usually I just attributed that to

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.140 
usually I just attributed that to
condensation<00:02:39.829> that<00:02:40.250> was<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.670> cylinders

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
condensation that was in the cylinders

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.819 
condensation that was in the cylinders
when<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.299> first<00:02:41.540> started<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.139> after<00:02:42.379> it's<00:02:42.530> sat

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
when I first started it after it's sat

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.160 
when I first started it after it's sat
for<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.129> while<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.700> always<00:02:43.819> stopped<00:02:44.299> now

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
for a while and it always stopped now

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.720 
for a while and it always stopped now
what<00:02:45.409> happens<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:46.010> water<00:02:46.250> comes<00:02:46.579> out

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
what happens is the water comes out

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.879 
what happens is the water comes out
there<00:02:46.939> in<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.090> pretty<00:02:47.329> study<00:02:47.719> study<00:02:48.409> stream

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
there in a pretty study study stream

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.690 
there in a pretty study study stream
when<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.090> motors<00:02:50.840> running<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.340> stops

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
when the motors running and it stops

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
when the motors running and it stops
only<00:02:53.060> after<00:02:53.599> all<00:02:54.439> of<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.599> radiator<00:02:56.599> is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
only after all of the the radiator is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.890 
only after all of the the radiator is
empty<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:57.919> what<00:02:58.879> I'm<00:02:58.970> gonna<00:02:59.060> do<00:02:59.239> now<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.480> I'm

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
empty so what I'm gonna do now is I'm

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.349 
empty so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna<00:03:00.049> start<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.859> up<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:02.180> hear

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
gonna start it up so that you can hear

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:22.910 
gonna start it up so that you can hear
what<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.569> motor<00:03:02.750> sounds<00:03:03.169> like

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:55.970 

the<00:03:23.160> exhaust<00:03:23.550> stack

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.649 

spitting<00:03:56.670> water<00:03:56.849> out<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.209> there<00:03:57.420> right<00:03:57.450> now

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
spitting water out of there right now

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.500 
spitting water out of there right now
with<00:03:58.310> wanna<00:03:59.310> suck<00:03:59.670> royal<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:01.049> oily<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:03.330> would

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
with wanna suck royal it's oily it would

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.180 
with wanna suck royal it's oily it would
be<00:04:03.629> coming<00:04:03.810> out<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.019> study<00:04:04.349> stream<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:04.980> most

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
be coming out in study stream but most

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:33.240 
be coming out in study stream but most
of<00:04:05.340> its<00:04:05.489> off<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.760> leaked<00:04:06.000> out

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.070 

now<00:04:34.250> when<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.940> cooling<00:04:35.360> system<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.840> topped

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
now when the cooling system is topped

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.620 
now when the cooling system is topped
off<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:37.340> water<00:04:37.550> will<00:04:37.730> just<00:04:37.910> continue<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.330> flow

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
off the water will just continue to flow

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.290 
off the water will just continue to flow
out<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.960> there<00:04:39.080> after<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.410> shut<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:39.740> down<00:04:39.860> for

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
out of there after I shut it down for

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.720 
out of there after I shut it down for
about<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.360> minute<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:45.190> actually<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.460> engine

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
about a minute so actually the engine

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.340 
about a minute so actually the engine
still<00:04:47.000> sounds<00:04:47.389> exactly<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.840> way<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.139> did

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
still sounds exactly the way it did

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.400 
still sounds exactly the way it did
before<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:49.250> happened<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.990> then<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.230> other

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
before this happened and then the other

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.930 
before this happened and then the other
detail<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.830> should<00:04:52.130> add<00:04:52.280> is<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.490> when<00:04:52.730> the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
detail I should add is that when the

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.010 
detail I should add is that when the
cooling<00:04:53.450> system<00:04:53.780> was<00:04:53.960> empty<00:04:54.889> I<00:04:55.040> started<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.760> up

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
cooling system was empty I started it up

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.240 
cooling system was empty I started it up
totally<00:04:57.020> forgot<00:04:57.290> about<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.560> fact<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:57.980> had

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
totally forgot about the fact that I had

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.990 
totally forgot about the fact that I had
the<00:04:58.960> the<00:05:00.070> straight<00:05:01.070> water<00:05:01.280> in<00:05:01.520> there<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:01.910> it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
the the straight water in there so it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.700 
the the straight water in there so it
didn't<00:05:02.210> realize<00:05:02.540> that<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.050> cooling<00:05:03.440> system

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
didn't realize that the cooling system

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.550 
didn't realize that the cooling system
was<00:05:03.800> empty<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.870> actually<00:05:05.870> was<00:05:06.110> running<00:05:06.500> the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
was empty and actually was running the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.430 
was empty and actually was running the
machine<00:05:06.860> driving<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.820> around<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.389> then<00:05:09.320> it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
machine driving it around and then it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.730 
machine driving it around and then it
stalled<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:11.060> realized<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:12.350> reason<00:05:12.620> why<00:05:12.710> I

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
stalled and I realized the reason why I

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.110 
stalled and I realized the reason why I
had<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.889> stalled<00:05:13.250> was<00:05:13.639> because<00:05:13.970> they<00:05:14.090> had

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
had it stalled was because they had

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.070 
had it stalled was because they had
overheated<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:15.889> let<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.460> cool<00:05:16.610> down<00:05:16.669> I<00:05:17.330> made

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
overheated so I let it cool down I made

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.480 
overheated so I let it cool down I made
sure<00:05:18.229> I<00:05:18.260> didn't<00:05:18.470> put<00:05:18.590> cold<00:05:18.800> water<00:05:18.889> in<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.340> hot

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
sure I didn't put cold water in a hot

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.730 
sure I didn't put cold water in a hot
engine<00:05:19.880> I<00:05:20.000> let<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.270> cool<00:05:20.389> down<00:05:20.600> came<00:05:21.530> back<00:05:21.710> a

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
engine I let it cool down came back a

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.430 
engine I let it cool down came back a
few<00:05:21.830> hours<00:05:22.100> later<00:05:22.750> tried<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.870> top<00:05:24.050> off<00:05:24.260> the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
few hours later tried to top off the

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.629 
few hours later tried to top off the
radiator<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.979> that's<00:05:25.190> when<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.370> discovered

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
radiator and that's when I discovered

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.330 
radiator and that's when I discovered
the<00:05:25.910> holes<00:05:26.090> in<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.360> radiator<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:30.220> topped<00:05:31.220> it

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
the holes in the radiator so I topped it

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.730 
the holes in the radiator so I topped it
off<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.960> started<00:05:32.960> it<00:05:33.050> up<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.410> that's<00:05:33.590> when

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
off and started it up and that's when

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.390 
off and started it up and that's when
the<00:05:33.830> water<00:05:33.979> started<00:05:34.690> pumping<00:05:35.690> out<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:35.810> that

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
the water started pumping out of that

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.920 
the water started pumping out of that
that<00:05:37.400> line<00:05:37.700> again<00:05:38.510> that<00:05:38.870> line<00:05:39.080> is<00:05:39.289> right<00:05:40.280> here

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
that line again that line is right here

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.750 
that line again that line is right here
so<00:05:42.070> that's<00:05:43.070> where<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.370> stands<00:05:43.640> right<00:05:43.760> now

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
so that's where it stands right now

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.370 
so that's where it stands right now
alright<00:05:46.760> one<00:05:46.910> last<00:05:46.940> thing<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.360> want<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.600> add<00:05:47.720> one

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
alright one last thing I want to add one

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.930 
alright one last thing I want to add one
last<00:05:48.500> observation<00:05:48.919> I<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:49.580> checked<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.850> oil

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
last observation I just checked the oil

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.760 
last observation I just checked the oil
level<00:05:50.300> with<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.289> dipstick

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
level with the dipstick

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.340 
level with the dipstick
I<00:05:51.979> wiped<00:05:52.460> it<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:52.789> checked<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:54.169> oil

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
I wiped it and checked it and the oil

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.120 
I wiped it and checked it and the oil
level<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:55.130> on<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.090> low<00:05:56.270> side<00:05:56.570> but<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.950> oil

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
level is on the low side but the oil

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.800 
level is on the low side but the oil
other<00:05:58.520> than<00:05:58.760> being<00:05:58.940> its<00:05:59.150> characteristic

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
other than being its characteristic

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.950 
other than being its characteristic
black<00:06:00.110> color<00:06:00.410> has<00:06:00.889> no<00:06:01.250> indication<00:06:02.060> of<00:06:02.210> water

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
black color has no indication of water

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.170 
black color has no indication of water
contamination<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:04.130> also<00:06:04.430> the<00:06:04.550> crankcase<00:06:04.880> is

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
contamination and also the crankcase is

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.870 
contamination and also the crankcase is
not<00:06:05.330> overfilled<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:07.070> have<00:06:07.280> no<00:06:07.490> reason<00:06:07.850> to

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
not overfilled so I have no reason to

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.350 
not overfilled so I have no reason to
believe<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.270> any<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.960> that<00:06:09.110> water<00:06:09.560> that<00:06:10.360> I'm

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
believe that any of that water that I'm

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.870 
believe that any of that water that I'm
losing<00:06:11.930> is<00:06:12.110> getting<00:06:12.590> into<00:06:12.919> the<00:06:13.010> crankcase<00:06:13.400> it

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
losing is getting into the crankcase it

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.750 
losing is getting into the crankcase it
all<00:06:14.060> seems<00:06:14.389> to<00:06:14.510> be<00:06:15.160> confined<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.460> part<00:06:16.700> of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
all seems to be confined to the part of

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.710 
all seems to be confined to the part of
the<00:06:16.910> engine<00:06:17.270> that<00:06:17.450> is<00:06:18.880> has<00:06:19.880> to<00:06:20.030> do<00:06:20.150> with<00:06:20.270> the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
the engine that is has to do with the

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.590 
the engine that is has to do with the
airbox<00:06:21.590> area<00:06:21.979> from<00:06:22.130> what<00:06:22.310> I<00:06:22.340> understand<00:06:22.850> when

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
airbox area from what I understand when

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.680 
airbox area from what I understand when
I've<00:06:23.750> been<00:06:23.900> told<00:06:24.139> and<00:06:24.639> I<00:06:25.639> just<00:06:26.419> find<00:06:26.570> it

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
I've been told and I just find it

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.600 
I've been told and I just find it
interesting<00:06:26.780> that<00:06:27.200> when<00:06:27.470> the<00:06:27.680> radiators

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
interesting that when the radiators

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.270 
interesting that when the radiators
filled<00:06:29.030> and<00:06:29.389> I<00:06:29.690> take<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.080> cap<00:06:30.320> off<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.740> top<00:06:30.950> I

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
filled and I take the cap off the top I

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.520 
filled and I take the cap off the top I
don't<00:06:31.850> see<00:06:32.000> any<00:06:32.150> bubbles<00:06:32.510> coming<00:06:32.840> out<00:06:32.960> to

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
don't see any bubbles coming out to

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.580 
don't see any bubbles coming out to
indicate<00:06:33.919> exhaust<00:06:34.520> gases<00:06:35.139> or<00:06:36.139> compressed

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
indicate exhaust gases or compressed

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.890 
indicate exhaust gases or compressed
gases<00:06:37.159> from<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.820> combustion<00:06:38.180> chamber<00:06:38.720> being

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
gases from the combustion chamber being

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.440 
gases from the combustion chamber being
pushed<00:06:39.200> into<00:06:39.409> the<00:06:39.590> cooling<00:06:39.950> system<00:06:40.340> but<00:06:41.150> they

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
pushed into the cooling system but they

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.210 
pushed into the cooling system but they
must<00:06:41.690> be<00:06:41.810> getting<00:06:41.930> in<00:06:42.200> there<00:06:42.409> because

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
must be getting in there because

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.969 
must be getting in there because
I<00:06:43.250> can't<00:06:44.150> think<00:06:44.389> of<00:06:44.509> any<00:06:45.110> other<00:06:45.470> way<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.740> water

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
I can't think of any other way the water

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.730 
I can't think of any other way the water
would<00:06:46.190> be<00:06:46.690> getting<00:06:47.690> into<00:06:47.870> that<00:06:48.139> area<00:06:48.379> of<00:06:48.650> the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
would be getting into that area of the

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.700 
would be getting into that area of the
engine<00:06:49.099> without<00:06:50.050> going<00:06:51.050> through<00:06:51.080> there<00:06:51.470> so<00:06:53.710> of

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
engine without going through there so of

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.230 
engine without going through there so of
course<00:06:54.919> I<00:06:55.129> could<00:06:55.340> be<00:06:55.370> just<00:06:55.639> completely<00:06:55.940> wrong

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
course I could be just completely wrong

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.969 
course I could be just completely wrong
I<00:06:56.539> don't<00:06:56.900> really<00:06:57.050> know<00:06:57.199> the<00:06:57.349> anatomy<00:06:57.590> of<00:06:57.800> this

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
I don't really know the anatomy of this

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.820 
I don't really know the anatomy of this
and<00:06:58.190> that's<00:06:58.310> why<00:06:58.520> I'm<00:06:59.169> getting<00:07:00.169> advice<00:07:00.590> online

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
and that's why I'm getting advice online

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.870 
and that's why I'm getting advice online
from<00:07:01.669> people<00:07:01.940> who<00:07:02.030> do<00:07:02.210> know<00:07:02.330> these<00:07:02.539> motors
