00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.750
 to make a mold one can use a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 molding paw as I wanted 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 show on another movie or so 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 use latex our ex a benefit 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.269
 given much more flexibility for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.509
 forms a little difficult I memo latex 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 in a small container before 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.439
 start do not forget to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.070
 protect the patient that we are going to use 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.650
 with washing up liquid 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.250
 otherwise the patio will be unusable by the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:49.610
 following the dishwashing agent 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.610
 it is enough simply to cover 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.250
 long object rolled with latex 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.250
 we take it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.990
 well cover all parts of 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.990
 the object I'm doing a little bit overloaded on 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.090
 the side 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.090
 like that I'll have a mold will do a carry 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:35.659
 when the latex to dry one goes over a 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.250
 second layer always good of a guide 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.330
 and his brush 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.330
 the product of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.690
 more one pass of softer layers 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.869
 solid flower of shine dry coat on 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.880
 can put another one in knowing that 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.619
 we can wait several days before 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.390
 to redo a new layer I want 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.180
 no matter seven or eight layers 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.209
 later need to put enough for 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:24.570
 that the mold is solid 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:26.940
 so we'll take off and that made little 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:33.690
 whether it is this setting more or less 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:37.400
 following the shape of the object in 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 the object on one side and the slack of beams 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 then just fill the mold 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.690
 with her plaster for example or any 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.319
 other to family molding powders 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.220
 in ceramic powders I put it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.700
 in a container to hold it and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.700
 I sink my plaster in my form 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.200
 I type well we are all small 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200
 bubbles 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.849
 and all the bubbles that form at the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.159
 area 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.599
 if I did not tap I could have 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.989
 find at the level of the ears by 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:33.440
 example and I do not stop having to scratch 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:37.340
 world and I just have to leave these 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:49.700
 dogs when the very dry dish is enough 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:53.150
 to unmold carefully the mold is 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.829
 perfectly perfectly supple red and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.660
 can be reused to get a good 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.739
 result 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:09.859
 well finished being as we read it's a 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:14.500
 little bit the edges the months just 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:19.880
 gorÃ©e into a new plaster object too 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.750
 our original game our mold is 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.750
 the plaster object
