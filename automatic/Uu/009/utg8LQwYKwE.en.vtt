00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.340
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.350
 video dedicated to watchdog from today vi 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.090
 I speak of the company carried out 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.980
 a registration from the mobile device 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
 in this case the tablet is though 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.580
 side by side lower left 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.210
 the total image of the game I make you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.310
 see the main mode that paul 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 which it takes to connect 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.640
 mobile device then smartphone or 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.640
 tablet with the console 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.970
 therefore the console players against 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.310
 hiv in the pierce in the car while the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.860
 player on a tablet or smartphone 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.450
 against the police helicopter 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.920
 engaged in pursuit and can 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.340
 check all city devices 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 west of the city ​​are near the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.340
 player you can accumulate 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.460
 points that can then be spent on 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.339
 call back or police car or 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 activate the various devices in the city 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.710
 so how the steam pipes goes 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 well or take during gameplay 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.990
 I highly recommend anyone who has 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.000
 so wanted to try this too 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.609
 mode both on the console side and from the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.399
 mobile side because from my point of 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.320
 view is really fun and sells 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.689
 also quite deep 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.469
 as it allows to create a kind of 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:34.100
 growth curve being on the system of 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.399
 skills like that of the character 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.659
 short of the complete game in short 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.090
 obviously less elaborate though going 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.340
 forward by playing different games 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.499
 matches you can upgrade all 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.450
 all types of buses to call back e 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.170
 yes devices with which you can interact 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.170
 and the same helicopter that is commanded 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:00.409
 pente player from tablet commands it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.249
 You see the events through this marker 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.959
 position he must reach 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.340
 the helicopter and then lies in it 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.709
 so accumulating these mountains can 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.509
 interact by simply touching with i 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.580
 various city ​​or e devices if I also have 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
 from the top left menu call up 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.170
 the cars I recommend to see then oh well 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.580
 full screen video to have 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.090
 a better overview but 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.400
 however present a real onap partner 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 actually concrete with respect to 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 those released previously because 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 without taking anything away from that of titan 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.959
 fall for example we had them take it 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.530
 challenge the interests to see the data see 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.060
 the maps however in real time but one 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.470
 mode if it was not present while 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 the first time we see him on 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 play and this watch another dogs 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.260
 reason for me to try to do for 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.910
 play I said this I leave you 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.819
 gameplay I wanted to tell you this type 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.420
 of modality present the possibility of 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.040
 exploit it while having fun and how it was there 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.000
 remember to leave a like of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440
 write to the channel if the video is there 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.709

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 he asks if you want to ask me anything 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.620
 here I close the video I leave you at 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.780
 gameplay and as usual greeting e 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.780

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.610
 who we have next to the place 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.160
 i don't take out 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.870
 not even where you are 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.250
 don't make things worse the coast is 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.330
 Mormon in pursuit have suspicion 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.330
 now he does it with us 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.519
 stop immediately from an hour 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.520
 it didn't go well 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.520
