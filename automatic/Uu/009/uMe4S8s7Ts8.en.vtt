00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sandstorm I've actually also slowed down

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.250 
sandstorm I've actually also slowed down
the<00:00:40.320> footage<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.280> 175<00:00:42.270> percent<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the footage to about 175 percent so that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.680 
the footage to about 175 percent so that
you<00:00:43.469> guys<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:44.030> see<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.300> entire

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you guys can actually see this entire

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
you guys can actually see this entire
thing<00:00:46.050> played<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.710> everything<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> super

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
thing played out and everything is super

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.299 
thing played out and everything is super
slow<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> game<00:00:49.440> itself<00:00:49.620> slows

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
slow I know that the game itself slows

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
slow I know that the game itself slows
down<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> need<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.329> actions<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
down when you need to do actions but it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470 
down when you need to do actions but it
can<00:00:52.890> still<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.129> rather<00:00:53.460> quick<00:00:53.850> especially

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
can still be rather quick especially

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
can still be rather quick especially
when<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.809> trying<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.500> prompts

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
correct so what I've done is I've slowed

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.500 
correct so what I've done is I've slowed
it<00:00:57.899> down<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.579> which

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
