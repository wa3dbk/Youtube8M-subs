want to show you just how glitter things
actually<00:00:17.800> are<00:00:18.929> if<00:00:19.929> we<00:00:20.589> just<00:00:20.800> head<00:00:21.490> on<00:00:21.519> over

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
actually are if we just head on over

actually are if we just head on over
here<00:00:22.509> you<00:00:23.169> will<00:00:23.320> see<00:00:23.529> I<00:00:23.560> have<00:00:23.949> this<00:00:24.189> track

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
here you will see I have this track

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.349 
here you will see I have this track
running<00:00:25.150> out<00:00:25.269> over<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.900> water<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:27.550> if<00:00:28.119> you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
running out over the water now if you

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.450 
running out over the water now if you
know<00:00:28.449> anything<00:00:28.810> about<00:00:29.079> tnt<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.099> will<00:00:30.279> know

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
know anything about tnt you will know

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.299 
know anything about tnt you will know
that<00:00:30.519> it<00:00:31.509> does<00:00:31.810> nothing<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.290> war<00:00:32.560> and<00:00:32.800> what<00:00:33.219> are

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
that it does nothing to war and what are

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.650 
that it does nothing to war and what are
actually<00:00:33.609> stops<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.000> explosions<00:00:34.570> from

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
actually stops the explosions from

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.799 
actually stops the explosions from
damaging<00:00:35.230> anything<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.940> with<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.210> TNT<00:00:37.600> main

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
damaging anything but with the TNT main

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.189 
damaging anything but with the TNT main
cups<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:39.399> if<00:00:39.579> we<00:00:39.699> flip<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.120> switch<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.809> see

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
cups now if we flip this switch and see

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:48.029 
cups now if we flip this switch and see
what<00:00:41.320> happens<00:00:41.620> there<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.840> go<00:00:47.019> I've<00:00:47.859> actually

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
what happens there we go I've actually

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.819 
what happens there we go I've actually
managed<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:48.550> blow<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> hole<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.510> water<00:00:50.079> itself

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
managed to blow a hole in water itself

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.689 
managed to blow a hole in water itself
it's<00:00:51.640> obviously<00:00:52.149> should<00:00:52.780> be<00:00:53.019> impossible<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
it's obviously should be impossible so

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's obviously should be impossible so
beam<00:00:54.879> damage<00:00:55.269> was<00:00:55.449> like<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.570> few<00:00:55.750> blocks<00:00:55.989> over

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
beam damage was like a few blocks over

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.000 
beam damage was like a few blocks over
there<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:57.339> there<00:00:57.609> and<00:00:58.199> even<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.260> couple<00:00:59.499> as<00:00:59.710> far

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
there but there and even a couple as far

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.239 
there but there and even a couple as far
as<00:01:00.399> over<00:01:00.940> here<00:01:01.269> where<00:01:01.989> it's<00:01:02.109> actually<00:01:02.320> damaged

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
as over here where it's actually damaged

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.880 
as over here where it's actually damaged
in<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> ground<00:01:03.640> but<00:01:04.619> damage<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.770> water

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
in the ground but damage to water

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.370 
in the ground but damage to water
obviously<00:01:06.159> should<00:01:06.729> not<00:01:07.390> happen

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
obviously should not happen

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.690 
obviously should not happen
so<00:01:08.979> definitely<00:01:09.579> bug<00:01:09.850> should<00:01:10.659> be<00:01:10.750> fixed<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.700> have

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
so definitely bug should be fixed I have

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.380 
so definitely bug should be fixed I have
also<00:01:13.060> seen<00:01:13.829> couple<00:01:14.829> videos<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.549> actual

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
also seen couple videos of actual

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.889 
also seen couple videos of actual
obsidian<00:01:17.320> being<00:01:17.530> destroyed<00:01:17.950> by<00:01:18.220> them

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
obsidian being destroyed by them

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.210 
obsidian being destroyed by them
obviously<00:01:19.899> obsidian<00:01:20.710> should<00:01:21.040> be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
obviously obsidian should be

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.730 
obviously obsidian should be
indestructible<00:01:21.850> I've<00:01:22.780> not<00:01:23.259> been<00:01:23.380> able<00:01:23.530> to

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
indestructible I've not been able to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.090 
indestructible I've not been able to
recreate<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.189> myself<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.740> looks<00:01:26.950> of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
recreate that myself by the looks of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.649 
recreate that myself by the looks of
things<00:01:27.159> it<00:01:27.460> only<00:01:27.579> seems<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.909> happen<00:01:28.180> on<00:01:28.270> slower

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
things it only seems to happen on slower

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.510 
things it only seems to happen on slower
machines<00:01:29.049> I've<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.710> been<00:01:29.799> able<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.130> recreate

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
machines I've not been able to recreate

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.819 
machines I've not been able to recreate
it<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:30.969> machine<00:01:31.299> which<00:01:31.509> is<00:01:32.110> reasonably

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
it on this machine which is reasonably

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.480 
it on this machine which is reasonably
quick<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.680> that's<00:01:35.799> what<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.040> does<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.310> water

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
quick but that's what it does to water

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.330 
quick but that's what it does to water
I've<00:01:36.969> also<00:01:37.659> been<00:01:37.990> trying<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.649> combine<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
I've also been trying to combine the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.100 
I've also been trying to combine the
explosions<00:01:39.909> just<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.360> see<00:01:40.540> if<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.869> get<00:01:40.990> them

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
explosions just to see if I can get them

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
explosions just to see if I can get them
to<00:01:41.229> be<00:01:41.350> on<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.740> little<00:01:42.100> bit<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.430> bigger<00:01:42.579> side

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to be on a little bit on the bigger side

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.620 
to be on a little bit on the bigger side
so<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:44.920> head<00:01:45.340> over<00:01:45.579> town<00:01:45.820> for<00:01:46.180> night<00:01:46.360> time

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
so if we head over town for night time

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.609 
so if we head over town for night time
and<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.939> we<00:01:48.969> do<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:50.250> shall<00:01:52.469> see<00:01:53.469> what

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
and when we do that I shall see what

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.480 
and when we do that I shall see what
we're<00:01:53.770> doing

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.100 

you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.580 

and<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:08.460> we<00:02:08.580> are<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:11.540> we've<00:02:12.540> had<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.960> whole

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and here we are so we've had the whole

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
and here we are so we've had the whole
the<00:02:13.800> village<00:02:14.070> residents<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:14.940> come<00:02:15.150> out

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the village residents here have come out

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.500 
the village residents here have come out
to<00:02:15.480> watch<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.230> show<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.910> if<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to watch the show so if we just get this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.090 
to watch the show so if we just get this
set<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.320> for<00:02:19.800> them<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:21.590> sit<00:02:22.590> back<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.010> enjoy

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
set up for them and sit back and enjoy

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.880 
set up for them and sit back and enjoy
it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.540 

so<00:02:26.610> let's<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> TNT<00:02:27.780> main<00:02:28.560> cups<00:02:28.860> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
so let's just get the TNT main cups and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.920 
so let's just get the TNT main cups and
enough<00:02:30.240> we<00:02:30.390> go

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.860 

so<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.590> mole<00:02:40.800> loaded<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.660> with

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
so that's a mole loaded up get on with

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:56.840 
so that's a mole loaded up get on with
the<00:02:42.990> show<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:54.230> know<00:02:55.230> declare<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.920> new<00:02:56.160> TNT

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
the show I know declare the new TNT
