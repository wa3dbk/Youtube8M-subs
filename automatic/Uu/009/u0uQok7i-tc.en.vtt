 Every year, it's weird to go back to school. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.620
 But here we are, live the moment. 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.880
 Try to love. 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 And laugh a lot! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.220

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 You did not call me or send a message. 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.280
 I was busy with a girl. 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.180
 I do not want to know. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 Oh, my baby. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.680
 I am no longer a baby. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.790
 She is disgusting! 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.700
 Oh, do not be jealous. 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.790
 Do not worry. 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.380
 We are friends, but know that if I was in his place I never tired you. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.590
 Oh my God 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.300
 It is so beautiful that it hurts. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.960
 You're really amazing. 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.220

 - You come? - Yes. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
 Friendship is not so easy to become love. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490
 . 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.110

 A '' C '' in History ?! a '' D '' in Biology ?! 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.490
 Lola, are you kidding me ?! 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.380
 It's not my fault. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.970
 There is something I will not tolerate. 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.840
 Seriously? Which ones? 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.300
 Like missed your life! 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.100
 I have never been so mean, is it? 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.500
 Uh, yes sometimes yes. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.400

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.600
 Me too. 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 So you were at a party? Did something funny happen there? 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600
 It's so good to love someone as much as it hurts! 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 Hey, look, look. She wants to go out with him, I told you. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 You're disgusting! 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.500
 Lola, wait! 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.300
 Do you think Ashley and I ...? 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.500
 Go, do not lie to me. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 It's not my fault if she does not have a sense of humor. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.500
 '' STATUS '' CAN CHANGE 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 Now you know. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.720

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660
