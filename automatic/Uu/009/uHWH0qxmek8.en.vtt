one ok and also I've asked over bottle

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.020 
one ok and also I've asked over bottle
still<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.680> there's<00:02:58.860> no<00:02:58.950> vibrato<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.519> these<00:02:59.849> two

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
still so there's no vibrato on these two

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.050 
still so there's no vibrato on these two
pitches<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.840> Fabio<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.579> also<00:03:02.730> didn't<00:03:03.000> do

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
pitches for Fabio and I also didn't do

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.610 
pitches for Fabio and I also didn't do
my<00:03:03.120> brother<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.079> I<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.260> glissando

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
my brother there but I have a glissando

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.640 
my brother there but I have a glissando
here<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:06.090> vibrato<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.470> one

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
here and then vibrato here so that one

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.030 
here and then vibrato here so that one
down<00:03:07.799> there<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:09.329> when<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.379> pitch<00:03:10.890> is

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
down there and then when that pitch is

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.699 
down there and then when that pitch is
ending<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.670> sustain<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.780> G<00:03:12.930> sharp

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.399 

this<00:03:17.709> guy<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.310> we<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.299> lot<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.540> time<00:03:19.840> right

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
this guy and we have a lot of time right

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.339 
this guy and we have a lot of time right
there's<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.709> lot<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:20.980> space<00:03:21.519> here<00:03:21.549> in<00:03:22.180> which<00:03:22.900> we

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
there's a lot of space here in which we

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.929 
there's a lot of space here in which we
can<00:03:23.470> do<00:03:23.650> something<00:03:23.860> else<00:03:24.040> all<00:03:24.640> right<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:24.879> I

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
can do something else all right so I

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.149 
can do something else all right so I
just<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:26.079> simplicity<00:03:26.230> sake<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.829> just<00:03:27.010> wrote

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
just for simplicity sake I just wrote

the C sharp break in the beginning and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.619 
the C sharp break in the beginning and
I'm<00:03:51.099> just<00:03:51.310> harmonizing<00:03:51.879> that<00:03:52.000> line<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.390> i<00:03:52.450> went

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
I'm just harmonizing that line so i went

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:59.530 
I'm just harmonizing that line so i went
to<00:03:52.690> ease<00:03:52.870> i'm<00:03:53.079> playing<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.349> third<00:03:53.500> higher

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
trying to do and that point is you know

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670 
trying to do and that point is you know
Fabio<00:04:14.460> is<00:04:14.580> singing<00:04:15.140> these<00:04:16.140> pitches<00:04:16.440> pretty

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
Fabio is singing these pitches pretty

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.140 
Fabio is singing these pitches pretty
strong<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.250> seeing<00:04:17.430> everything<00:04:17.640> strong<00:04:17.970> but

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
strong we seeing everything strong but

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.480 
strong we seeing everything strong but
seeing<00:04:18.360> this<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:18.690> particularly<00:04:19.590> strong<00:04:22.490> for

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
seeing this one particularly strong for

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.670 
seeing this one particularly strong for
the<00:04:23.580> climax<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> whole<00:04:24.270> thing<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.930> instead

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the climax of the whole thing so instead

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.980 
the climax of the whole thing so instead
of<00:04:25.770> just<00:04:26.010> playing<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.430> pitches<00:04:26.910> for<00:04:27.150> me<00:04:27.660> to

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
of just playing the pitches for me to

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.090 
of just playing the pitches for me to
try<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:29.760> try<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.000> somehow<00:04:30.480> match<00:04:31.260> all<00:04:31.710> that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
try to to try to somehow match all that

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.370 
try to to try to somehow match all that
power<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.850> just<00:04:33.480> did<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> trauma<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.080> those

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
power I just did a trauma on those

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.170 
power I just did a trauma on those
pitches<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:35.130> were<00:04:35.490> harmonized<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.060> his

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
pitches that were harmonized to his

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.820 
pitches that were harmonized to his
pictures<00:04:36.510> okay<00:04:37.170> so<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:43.260> just<00:04:43.440> helps<00:04:43.650> add

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
pictures okay so it just helps add

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.640 
pictures okay so it just helps add
texture<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.020> note<00:04:46.170> i<00:04:46.290> didn't<00:04:46.470> want<00:04:46.590> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
texture to to the note i didn't want to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.080 
texture to to the note i didn't want to
change<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.130> notes<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.550> play<00:04:47.670> all<00:04:47.850> kinds<00:04:47.880> of

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
change the notes and play all kinds of

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.000 
change the notes and play all kinds of
different<00:04:48.210> notes<00:04:48.510> there<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.260> there<00:04:49.440> are<00:04:49.470> very

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
different notes there so there are very

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.240 
different notes there so there are very
important<00:04:51.200> structural<00:04:52.200> pitches<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.100> want

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
important structural pitches so I want

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.820 
important structural pitches so I want
to<00:04:53.280> keep<00:04:53.340> them<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:54.450> just<00:04:54.600> somehow<00:04:54.960> add<00:04:55.380> some

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
to keep them but just somehow add some

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.910 
to keep them but just somehow add some
more<00:04:55.950> texture<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.400> them<00:04:57.050> all<00:04:58.050> right<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.380> then

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
more texture to them all right and then

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.940 
more texture to them all right and then
again<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.520> brings<00:04:59.760> us<00:04:59.910> back<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:01.410> five

harmonic minor stuff is you really
emphasized<00:05:25.540> that<00:05:26.080> ok<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:26.890> this<00:05:27.040> case<00:05:27.330> I

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330

think the last thing I played was a

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.580 
think the last thing I played was a
pedal<00:05:30.250> point<00:05:30.400> like<00:05:33.480> okay<00:05:34.480> during<00:05:35.170> all<00:05:35.410> of<00:05:35.560> this

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
pedal point like okay during all of this

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.440 
pedal point like okay during all of this
space<00:05:35.830> he's<00:05:36.190> holding<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:36.580> out<00:05:36.760> again<00:05:36.910> around

the five core this is a g-sharp and I'm

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.890 
the five core this is a g-sharp and I'm
just<00:05:39.910> doing<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.210> little<00:05:40.420> harmonic<00:05:40.780> minor

little pedal point thing on that to sort
of<00:05:44.500> fill<00:05:44.770> in<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.980> gaps<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:46.630> makes<00:05:46.810> sense<00:05:46.990> so

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
of fill in the gaps that makes sense so

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.080 
of fill in the gaps that makes sense so
what<00:05:47.560> we<00:05:47.680> don't<00:05:47.860> want<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.160> do<00:05:48.280> in<00:05:48.460> this<00:05:48.580> case<00:05:48.820> or

what I didn't want to do in this case

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.520 
what I didn't want to do in this case
they<00:05:50.560> don't<00:05:50.620> want<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:50.920> like<00:05:51.100> step<00:05:51.880> all<00:05:52.120> over

they don't want to like step all over
his<00:05:53.530> folk<00:05:53.950> Alliance<00:05:54.340> because<00:05:54.430> they're<00:05:54.610> cool

stuff but play over a plate play along
with<00:06:02.290> those<00:06:02.920> pitches<00:06:03.580> okay

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:24.339 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.109

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:26.119 
that's what just sort of fills in the

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.529 
that's what just sort of fills in the
gaps<00:06:26.360> nice<00:06:26.719> it<00:06:27.259> doesn't<00:06:27.619> get<00:06:27.710> too<00:06:27.919> far<00:06:28.159> away

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
gaps nice it doesn't get too far away

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.299 
gaps nice it doesn't get too far away
from<00:06:29.539> the<00:06:29.899> vocal<00:06:30.319> thing<00:06:30.409> but<00:06:30.559> if<00:06:30.649> we<00:06:30.770> take<00:06:30.919> the

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:31.309 
from the vocal thing but if we take the

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.100 
from the vocal thing but if we take the
if<00:06:31.550> there<00:06:32.089> is<00:06:32.180> no<00:06:32.330> singing<00:06:32.599> if<00:06:32.779> we<00:06:32.869> take<00:06:32.960> the

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
if there is no singing if we take the

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.200 
if there is no singing if we take the
vocal<00:06:33.229> part<00:06:33.589> out<00:06:33.740> and<00:06:34.069> this<00:06:34.580> is<00:06:34.699> just<00:06:34.729> a<00:06:34.939> guitar

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
vocal part out and this is just a guitar

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.609 
vocal part out and this is just a guitar
so<00:06:35.360> it's<00:06:35.479> a<00:06:35.539> nice<00:06:35.659> little<00:06:35.839> melody<00:06:36.319> with<00:06:36.469> some

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
not me just going up and down playing a

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.969 
not me just going up and down playing a

bunch of arpeggios and licks and trying
to<00:06:43.069> cram<00:06:43.309> in<00:06:43.520> as<00:06:43.669> many<00:06:44.110> technical<00:06:45.110> things<00:06:45.319> as<00:06:45.409> I

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:45.499 
to cram in as many technical things as I

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.969 
to cram in as many technical things as I
can<00:06:46.059> okay<00:06:47.059> so<00:06:47.119> it's<00:06:47.419> still<00:06:47.539> lyrical<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.830> get

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
like okay so that would be an example of

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.239 
like okay so that would be an example of
just<00:06:56.569> sort<00:06:56.930> of<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.110> vocal<00:06:57.499> influenced

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.249 
just sort of the vocal influenced
