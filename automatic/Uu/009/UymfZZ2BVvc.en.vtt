to accommodate for that and one of the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
to accommodate for that and one of the
ways<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> cook<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.840> lot

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
ways I do that is I like to cook a lot

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
ways I do that is I like to cook a lot
at<00:00:37.380> once<00:00:37.680> rather<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:40.370> cooking<00:00:41.370> every<00:00:41.730> single

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
at once rather than cooking every single

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
at once rather than cooking every single
day<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.840> way<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.290> heat<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> house

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
day that way I only heat up the house

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
day that way I only heat up the house
once<00:00:44.460> rather<00:00:44.879> than<00:00:45.030> cooking<00:00:45.390> every<00:00:45.750> single

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
once rather than cooking every single

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
once rather than cooking every single
day<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.500> having<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> cool<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.309> every

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
day and then having to cool off every

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
day and then having to cool off every
day<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> easier<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.620> right<00:00:52.620> now

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.779 
I also cook at different times of the
day<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
