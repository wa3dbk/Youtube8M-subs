but the headphone cut out because of the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.069 
but the headphone cut out because of the
fact<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
fact that it is a little bit of a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
fact that it is a little bit of a
thicker<00:01:46.259> case<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.770> least<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.009> protection<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
thicker case at least for protection the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
thicker case at least for protection the
cutout<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.950> deeper<00:01:50.130> than

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
cutout is a little bit deeper than

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
cutout is a little bit deeper than
normal<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.869> doesn't<00:01:52.110> help<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> ipad

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
normal so it doesn't help with the ipad

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
normal so it doesn't help with the ipad
mini<00:01:52.799> does<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.280> cutout<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.729> an<00:01:53.820> angle

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
mini does have this cutout at an angle

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
mini does have this cutout at an angle
so<00:01:54.840> depending<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> headphones<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so depending on the headphones you have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.149 
so depending on the headphones you have
it<00:01:57.240> might<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.630> fit<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.229> i<00:01:58.439> try<00:01:58.860> different

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it might not fit so i try different

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.889 
it might not fit so i try different
headphones<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.700> actually<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.360> fit<00:02:00.719> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
headphones the actually all fit you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
headphones the actually all fit you
wanted<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.439> fit<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> headphone<00:02:02.340> adapter

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
wanted not fit was a headphone adapter

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
wanted not fit was a headphone adapter
or<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.509> mean<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> headphone<00:02:04.020> splitter<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
or i mean a headphone splitter so have a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
or i mean a headphone splitter so have a
thicker<00:02:05.850> headphone<00:02:06.240> splitter<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.750> just

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
thicker headphone splitter and i just

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.990 
thicker headphone splitter and i just
would<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.619> deep<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
would not go as deep to make the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.270 
would not go as deep to make the
connection<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.920> headphones<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.069> fine<00:02:11.250> but

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
connection so headphones are fine but

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.619 
connection so headphones are fine but
the<00:02:11.610> headphone<00:02:11.879> splitter<00:02:12.090> definitely<00:02:12.510> did

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the headphone splitter definitely did

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.930 
the headphone splitter definitely did
not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
not

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.570 
not
work<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.600> because<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> fact<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
work just because of the fact that the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.980 
work just because of the fact that the
headphone<00:02:15.580> cut<00:02:16.000> out<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.660> headphone

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
headphone cut out and the headphone

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.200 
headphone cut out and the headphone
angle<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> weird<00:02:18.100> place<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.640> it's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
angle is that a weird place so it's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.110 
angle is that a weird place so it's
definitely<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.570> deeper<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.790> had<00:02:21.940> no

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
definitely a deeper then if you had no

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.960 
definitely a deeper then if you had no
case<00:02:22.330> at<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.530> besides<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.130> guy's<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
case at all but besides that guy's the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 
case at all but besides that guy's the
case<00:02:25.270> feels<00:02:25.810> great<00:02:26.410> I've<00:02:27.310> had<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.790> about<00:02:27.880> a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
case feels great I've had it for about a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610 
case feels great I've had it for about a
week<00:02:28.210> now<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.480> as<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.900> see<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.230> like

love with it so it does retail for 9499
it's<00:02:40.300> not<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.510> cheapest<00:02:40.840> case<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.470> keep<00:02:41.950> in

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
it's not the cheapest case but keep in

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.800 
it's not the cheapest case but keep in
mind<00:02:42.130> you're<00:02:42.430> getting<00:02:42.610> real<00:02:42.940> leather<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
mind you're getting real leather and the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.590 
mind you're getting real leather and the
quality<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.380> feel<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.220> insane<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
quality and feel is just insane and it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.810 
quality and feel is just insane and it
helps<00:02:47.140> out<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> magnetic

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
helps out that you do get the magnetic

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.970 
helps out that you do get the magnetic
feature<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.620> different

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
feature and you do get the different

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.070 
feature and you do get the different
angles<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.910> actual<00:02:52.150> ipad<00:02:52.480> mini<00:02:52.690> itself

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080
