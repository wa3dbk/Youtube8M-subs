the<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.660> we've<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.260> 2<00:01:01.500> meters<00:01:01.859> 50<00:01:02.340> I'm

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the way up so we've got 2 meters 50 I'm

the way up so we've got 2 meters 50 I'm
going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> divide<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.480> five<00:01:03.840> equal

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to divide it into five equal

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
going to divide it into five equal
pieces<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.799> 500<00:01:05.489> lengths<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> your

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pieces of 500 lengths so this is your

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.330 
pieces of 500 lengths so this is your
first<00:01:06.689> piece<00:01:09.530> 500<00:01:10.939> second<00:01:11.939> piece<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:13.110> Essure

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.429 

150<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> two<00:01:20.939> meters<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.080> last<00:01:22.229> bits

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
150 and two meters and the last bits

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710 
150 and two meters and the last bits
fifty<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.509> set

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
fifty as well so this is where your set

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
fifty as well so this is where your set
square<00:01:24.990> comes<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.530> play<00:01:25.770> I've<00:01:26.549> decided

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
square comes into play I've decided

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.590 
square comes into play I've decided

right this is my face edge so all of my

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
right this is my face edge so all of my
lines<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.079> come<00:01:31.200> off<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> edge<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:36.470> two<00:01:40.220> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
lines will come off this edge one two so

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
lines will come off this edge one two so
what<00:01:41.369> notice<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> didn't<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.720> around

and sore knees but you're going to start
moving<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.730> won't<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> clean<00:02:39.330> edge

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
moving right you won't get a clean edge

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.800 
moving right you won't get a clean edge
and<00:02:39.900> you'll<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.590> trapped<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:42.150> position<00:02:42.690> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and you'll get trapped this position is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.120 
and you'll get trapped this position is
much<00:02:42.990> better<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.500> you're<00:02:43.710> using<00:02:43.890> your

much better because you're using your

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760 
much better because you're using your
body<00:02:44.280> way<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> keep<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> stable<00:02:45.630> now<00:02:46.620> I'm

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
body way to keep it stable now I'm

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.160 
body way to keep it stable now I'm
almost<00:02:47.070> through<00:02:47.340> nice<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.870> point

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
almost through nice so at this point

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.060 
almost through nice so at this point
crossover<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.350> see<00:02:55.500> what's<00:02:55.709> happening

crossover now you see what's happening
here<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.880> swords<00:02:57.390> getting<00:02:57.660> trapped<00:02:57.959> now

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
here is the swords getting trapped now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.199 
here is the swords getting trapped now
there's<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.220> tiny<00:02:59.520> corner<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> bottom

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
