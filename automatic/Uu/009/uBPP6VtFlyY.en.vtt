00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.290
 see where the looks familiar 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.290
 Pokemon phenomena at play 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.210

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.430
 petting my pension as normal 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 because i succeeded guys i got it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.019
 we simply do not charge the company 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 lasted longer than intended 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.080
 I also say I now have two eggs 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 but what I do with my cock 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 not left behind but clashed 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
 with each other so I now have a good time playing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.899
 so yes i have no idea which one should 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.590
 make yes as you see this is just 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.200
 my favorite pewds I know you slightly 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.750
 you may also want to go all day 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 so little red school all citizens are the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 the melt just melts hard 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.949
 anyway no and for the rest I am 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.219
 You finally snatched me by the thumb 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 gone it was fat it was epic 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.120
 and yes i am really very curious what 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.370
 what's going to happen because me 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 must now go to the ears and now is the mac 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.729
 revolution guru and I think he goes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.260
 the game still cool but that he the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.000
 error of thought failed 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 the crack they all think alive and well 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 it is, therefore, that brands make evolution 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.290
 in it means that jump in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.350
 store 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.630
 listen well inpetto again I think 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.580
 itself quite cool because it used to be small 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.720
 kid what answer to cherry kind 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.509
 even more badass became that is possible now and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.620
 it's just super fat for the rest yes 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.480
 I'm just actually yes 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.880
 it is it completely fake i am 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.340

 slightly in love because it is god 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 look how cute that animal is and then 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.440
 totally remember that i have his 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.810
 father and mother put together 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.760
 he went there completely dissolve patser 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 then i got that he got away with it 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.450
 start walking and now is just a child 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.150
 I just go every day 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.610
 gray with youtube and like you 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.560
 maybe refuse or not sit down 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.720
 power button to whom even more cool stuff 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.850
 this way you can also have a church 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.510
 Latin name is just cute anyway 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.040
 boys just look nice 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.980
 investigate 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.740
 it an orange by oh well just eat it 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 hit boy and then look ff look 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.420
 you can do it again you can do it again 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.440
 all games on one another as I 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.360
 for example the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.870
 I was just quick to show I'm here 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.490
 of course an incredible pro to and from 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.430
 the father hears boys 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.890
 ted pokémon then his must do yes 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.410
 let's do okay 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.940
 reddie well then we go I think so 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.350
 pathetic that they all put things on my 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.880
 are going to drop retirement because it 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.350
 did not deserve at all 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 worked hard because he will hear 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.750
 grandpa and some salt case look if you like that 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 Play games first, they are 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.200
 the one of the way slightly 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 addictive so i also think it is real 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.560
 actually great to play 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.290
 pussy crap and what what what is your idea as 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.300
 you do very well than a box 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.100
 all things where your pichu or 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.360
 other pokémons can play me 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.769
 in pokémon family and you get too 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.269
 all of the viewers that I just 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.370
 specified floor must of course 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.140
 from somewhere so those in loki 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.300
 you me too and I actually like it 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.560
 super cool this that this would be in this 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.959
 pokémon is for it 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.940
 it's for someone like me this is not 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.640
 constantly busy with the story maud 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.440
 super fat to just also constantly 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.959
 to be able to make teams progress 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 meines don't really go ahead with it 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.650
 story and I think that's super cool 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.120
 they bring in the sit and then too 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.220
 once super expanded as you can see 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.019
 and I'll come another whopper and that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.349
 indirectly, of course 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.560
 let's see what the outside guys are 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.150
 my amateur can start the fixler 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.319
 I so how many poker puppies I am going to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.489
 Europe and so there are still many 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.650
 other games one more thing me 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.600
 also quickly out of a real short 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.280
 show it 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.630
 because my attention has also been received 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.340
 super training 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.720
 that is to say that you determined 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.320
 time of pokémon 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.210
 can make it even better and that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.470
 must also go through the species again 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.389
 family game 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.110
 I will keep you short for a very short time 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.729
 see it is it is an it is inconvenient 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.950
 this show the effects but we go 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.300
 just do it 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.539
 we are going to see if we have something 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.240
 can do to the thief and states of 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.600
 jody and or so a joey jan bosmans with 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.600
 your team 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.320
 Well as you can see I must be a fool 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:55.090
 does the balloon attack with my flurry 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.760
 you and you do that through on it 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.669
 bottom screen you have to focus 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.760
 and and release and tap do you want if you 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.470
 actually a ball comes out like you 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.900
 I just saw it already because 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 I left my ball charger that is one 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.919
 super big football law 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.590
 and then from sleep you make him think so 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.020
 it is simple as you see it here 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.360
 now with me those fans plus 4 that stays 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.220
 stop here constantly until this bar 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.380
 is full and have said with your special 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.350
 getting you the sexes can do with it 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.120
 you used it completely and then what 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.830
 also the cool thing is that you 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.740
 will say now those fans and jaw 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.340
 That means that you are not ready yet 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.680
 You are namely your pokémon 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.349
 against training per can be as if 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.780
 he really is in a game and that I train 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.740
 work now choose who here europe who guy 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.169
 and 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.560
 yes this is actually the point at which you 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.150
 I really want to say that there is fans going 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.010
 improve and then you really have to 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.890
 I choke the blood pressure the click enter 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.950
 press tap tap tap tap the hips and 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.810
 hope you ok that time limit is a bit more 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.180
 no crisis and you will see that if you do 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.849
 levels up it just goes every time 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.310
 just a little faster for me so now 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.990
 with me those guys like you 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.120
 probably have seen the 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.039
 past thumb of pokémon journal 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.810
 I basically explained everything already 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.789
 to be highlighted 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.940
 had super training pokémon and who had 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.800
 certain evolutions certain apps that you 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.440
 can get it and you name it 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.210
 Well the following is going on you 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.800
 can decide for myself what to put in the 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.810
 following pokémon diaries 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.550
 throw it in the comments at a moment 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.240
 why do not necessarily want me to leave that 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.349
 see 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.349
 and then we'll just do it for you
