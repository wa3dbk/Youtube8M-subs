00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.089
 great good with driveways 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
 sorted out made a travel way so 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.920
 let's say yes our 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.219
 building spots she spot on the spot 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 buildings so let's say in the first drop 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.220
 heights it turns out plus there are still old so 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.100
 let's say 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.380
 semi dried trees bushes and everything else 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.080
 plus some more garbage up how to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 act our client well what always 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.480
 they say that the garbage must be removed 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 I, too, for what you need to clean up the garbage 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 it is clear yes hit the garden layer is necessary 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 take off here as if tell a little bit 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.460
 algorithm is correct algorithm yes when 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.010
 here we have how we text 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559
 if you correct everything and say that is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 dry trees of course those come together 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 trees that want to save them 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.300
 it is necessary to make wooden 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.250
 sunburn stuffy not be too lazy because 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 construction let's say this is all basis 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 human factor and here it turns out 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.299
 such a situation if you do not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.799
 some kind of protection 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.979
 surely there will be some both let 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.939
 up to which will enter this tree on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 someone else's equipment 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.479
 so be sure to place a tree want 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.020
 save which must take it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.670
 protective from start and safety fence 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.990
 so that no one comes just usually up 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 100 log times 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.270
 that is some kind of tree yes there on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.549
 distance there for example here's the trunk 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.900
 somewhere there is half a meter and if you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.640
 want to save 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.640
 done simply 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.650
 bollards some temporary fence here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 and we protect thus protect 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.190
 tree in order not to damage 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
 because again perry wives cherish 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 protect save not protect 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.710
 surely there will be the one who rides will start 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.509
 visit us on a career fucking well people they 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 unique people honestly just need to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.040
 amazed at what they do 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.770
 therefore, we must defend ourselves, that is, we 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.190
 won't do could hurt 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.410
 then the fertile layer after said u 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.459
 us and that there start to build a house about 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.020
 this does not reflect in the project again 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.360
 It also provides for the so-called 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.590
 Vertikalka is done that is, the house is it 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.410
 we have a place to sit down with not only 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.739
 the plan and may be sure to plant 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:35.370
 vertically and went really on 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.760
 he was given a house at what height to put 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.390
 or you might have a road there for example 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 till the road went then went 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.910
 slope you have to once again put the house and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.610
 depending on how high you are 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.850
 put will depend on how much you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.680
 the soil will need to be fertile 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.989
 layer what he was not there even if he 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.049
 poor anyway it's so fertile 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.910
 he is still present 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.530
 livelihood goes yes that is it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.840
 yours still has value for 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 relation to dreams below therefore it 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.310
 always in this spot is better to remove 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.540
 better to withdraw take somewhere side with 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.190
 stock side 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 yes there built a house this ground 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.680
 leveled 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.860
 and as a result you have to be less 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.530
 deliver it immediately with an item 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.739
 saving your day your obesity 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.350
 therefore it is necessary to appreciate what we have and 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.380
 it saves the maximum ie it is not 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.880
 just the struggle of the ecological world is even 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.060
 Finance is beneficial for everyone 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.340
 I want to do it just it is so profitable 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.020
 I will say therefore it should be done well 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.760
 please tell me more 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.160
 about site planning 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.390
 this is also an important question yes in order to 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.730
 people understood bitches 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 numero is generally a plot to do with another to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.230
 the very latest twisted well up to 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.570
 of course you can still do on 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.600
 the foundation phase is reporting 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.710
 done last but not least 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.650
 so I don't know how often 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.180
 actually talk about it at all but 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 again without 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 vertikalki vertikalka this when we 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.600
 we tie the house 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.150
 existing vertical road we 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.660
 must arrange with you outdoor before 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.090
 it will rain it will snow 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 geology is completely different yes there 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.290
 It happens so that the soil and clay 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.630
 so in the spring always the top becomes 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.940
 so games but this one there did not dare 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.210
 this precipitation with heavy rainfall 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.310
 as in clay soil for example weakly 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.230
 filtered water water does not go away she just 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.990
 on your site like a pool 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.330
 accumulates so that this was not 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.650
 in project 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.510
 initially in the project provides 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.750
 what should be here if it comes 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.450
 Roads house we should not forget about 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.820
 the fact that where the water goes is why the house 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.790
 often found on a hill like 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.670
 relation to the rest of the site we have to 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.040
 for example be sure to divert water from 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.220
 at home, be sure to spill water along the path 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.970
 on the road on the road you already went 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.900
 somewhere there further yes for example if 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.240
 weaving 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.030
 clay soil and really for 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.080
 short worries can do 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.320
 for example here channels are made well them 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.040
 not visible it makes a request for events and until 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.290
 pits where the gap falls asleep closes 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.540
 geotag stephen from above went there sand 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.850
 touch your black soil r 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.670
 zones of this are not visible but since here 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.670
 for example everywhere clay soil water 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.890
 just by melting snow it moves to 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.010
 we direct our soil directly 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.710
 for example to this water from the mountains is nowhere 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.020
 let's say where it accumulates and little by little 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.600
 gradually goes away dries out 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.460
 but our house is dry ie we are so 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.440
 way we save ourselves from these skating lines 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.510
 and will be going somewhere down 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.920
 the site if we have a health situation 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:08.010
 went down if the plot is like a bull out of the way 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.920
 then it is of course good here and here 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.130
 there is a road to the stretch of road has 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.110
 the bias is well wonderful but in this 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.260
 year we have two sites have these what 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.670
 road bias and it turns out right here 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.310
 mountain neighbors lined up to be completed 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.560
 the plot is here the water from here goes 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.950
 on the road partly even flows to the site 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.690
 that is, you need to do the vertical 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.150
 make sure to plan this 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.980
 that's what happens as it is a lot 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.010
 work a lot in dirty work can 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.080
 be required to import a lot of soil 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.200
 the main part here is a rough job 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.450
 make a foundation at the stage 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.210
 still that is, provide it too places 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.310
 for example there will be no water to dominate 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.970
 drainage channels some kind of drainage 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.410
 some wells but clean 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.200
 already planning to do for all the same 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.210
 after construction yes we have 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.310
 the house is already built when we are with you 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.490
 start doing all sorts of tracks 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.800
 road garage track switches for 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.720
 the garden there before the device around the house here 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.440
 this is already done finishing layout 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.440
 the whole plot
