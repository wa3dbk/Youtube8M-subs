00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
a 1 gigahertz it also uses a three axis

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
a 1 gigahertz it also uses a three axis
gyro<00:03:56.950> which<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.129> better<00:03:58.700> for<00:03:58.849> gaming<00:03:59.480> when

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
gyro which is better for gaming when
