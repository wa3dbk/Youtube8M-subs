00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
plenty the same we were were fighting

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.480 
plenty the same we were were fighting
for<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.690> European<00:05:01.230> place<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:02.430> know

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
for that European place and you know

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.740 
for that European place and you know
it's<00:05:02.640> always<00:05:02.760> going<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.060> taped<00:05:03.360> than<00:05:03.570> that

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
people that were ahead of us only

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.360 
people that were ahead of us only
winning<00:05:09.660> by<00:05:09.780> big<00:05:10.140> margins<00:05:10.320> do<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.100> think<00:05:11.250> that

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
winning by big margins do you think that

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.370 
winning by big margins do you think that
this<00:05:11.700> was<00:05:11.910> satisfactory<00:05:12.570> sounds<00:05:13.110> like<00:05:13.230> of

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
this was satisfactory sounds like of

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.030 
this was satisfactory sounds like of
Athenian<00:05:13.920> 00<00:05:14.510> at<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.570> penalty<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.260> can't<00:05:16.590> worry

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
Athenian 00 at the penalty I can't worry

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.670 
Athenian 00 at the penalty I can't worry
or<00:05:17.400> legislate<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.510> another<00:05:18.720> tape<00:05:18.960> story<00:05:19.230> all

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
or legislate for another tape story all

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.700 
or legislate for another tape story all
I<00:05:19.740> can't<00:05:20.070> concentrate<00:05:20.400> on<00:05:20.730> his<00:05:20.850> Bohemians<00:05:21.330> and

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
I can't concentrate on his Bohemians and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.990 
I can't concentrate on his Bohemians and
I<00:05:22.710> guess<00:05:22.979> we<00:05:23.310> can't<00:05:23.550> bear<00:05:23.700> to<00:05:23.760> get<00:05:23.850> three

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
I guess we can't bear to get three

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.060 
I guess we can't bear to get three
points<00:05:24.150> we<00:05:24.390> didn't<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:25.350> we<00:05:25.410> didn't<00:05:25.830> get<00:05:25.890> Beth

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
points we didn't but we didn't get Beth

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.310 
points we didn't but we didn't get Beth
I'm<00:05:26.520> like<00:05:26.700> that's<00:05:27.030> another<00:05:27.300> clean<00:05:27.570> shape<00:05:27.810> not

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
I'm like that's another clean shape not

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.190 
I'm like that's another clean shape not
stop<00:05:28.560> with<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.890> with<00:05:29.040> a<00:05:29.070> new<00:05:29.700> keeper<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.780> you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
stop with it with a new keeper in so you

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.510 
stop with it with a new keeper in so you
know<00:05:31.290> that's<00:05:31.440> that's<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.979> good<00:05:32.100> points<00:05:32.460> i

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
know that's that's the good points i

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.490 
know that's that's the good points i
still<00:05:32.760> think<00:05:32.940> tonight<00:05:33.300> we<00:05:33.810> created<00:05:34.200> probably

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
still think tonight we created probably

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.560 
still think tonight we created probably
the<00:05:34.950> best<00:05:35.160> chances<00:05:35.520> in<00:05:35.610> here<00:05:35.850> you<00:05:36.450> know<00:05:36.510> i

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
the best chances in here you know i

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.909 
the best chances in here you know i
think<00:05:36.600> ur<00:05:36.900> we<00:05:36.990> had<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.140> great<00:05:37.320> chance<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.710> first

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
think ur we had a great chance the first

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.469 
think ur we had a great chance the first
half<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.340> there's<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> couple<00:05:38.970> of<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> couple<00:05:39.419> of

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
half and there's a couple of a couple of

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.700 
half and there's a couple of a couple of
chances<00:05:39.600> in<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.870> second<00:05:40.200> half<00:05:40.320> or<00:05:40.470> think<00:05:40.650> we

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
chances in the second half or think we

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.620 
chances in the second half or think we
should<00:05:40.860> have<00:05:40.950> done<00:05:41.070> better<00:05:41.220> but<00:05:42.000> you<00:05:42.479> know<00:05:42.510> you

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
should have done better but you know you

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.210 
should have done better but you know you
can't<00:05:42.900> harp<00:05:43.110> on<00:05:43.260> about<00:05:43.290> that<00:05:43.620> plaque<00:05:43.919> was<00:05:44.040> it

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
can't harp on about that plaque was it

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.090 
can't harp on about that plaque was it
came<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.880> we<00:05:45.360> didn't<00:05:46.110> do<00:05:46.260> enough<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.710> justify

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
came and we didn't do enough to justify

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.920 
came and we didn't do enough to justify
probably<00:05:47.550> one<00:05:47.669> in<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.850> game<00:05:48.000> tonight<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.570> it
