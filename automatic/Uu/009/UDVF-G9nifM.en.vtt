00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
what I already had I already had the 30

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.800 
what I already had I already had the 30
volume<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.610> 30<00:02:54.060> volume<00:02:54.360> worked<00:02:54.660> pretty

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
volume but the 30 volume worked pretty

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.630 
volume but the 30 volume worked pretty
well<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.290> when<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.800> bleached<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:56.190> hair<00:02:56.280> my

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
well and when I bleached my hair my

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.670 
well and when I bleached my hair my
extensions<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.540> my<00:02:57.930> hair<00:02:58.140> was<00:02:58.350> like

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
extensions and my hair was like

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.770 
extensions and my hair was like
different<00:02:59.130> there<00:02:59.730> were<00:02:59.850> different<00:03:00.240> shades<00:03:00.570> of

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
different there were different shades of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.060 
different there were different shades of
colors<00:03:01.580> from<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.730> bleach<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:04.470> got<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
colors from the bleach and it got it the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.640 
colors from the bleach and it got it the
same<00:03:05.280> color<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.300> was<00:03:06.630> pretty<00:03:07.200> happy<00:03:07.380> about

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
same color so I was pretty happy about

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.040 
same color so I was pretty happy about
that<00:03:11.030> what<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.480> good<00:03:12.660> about<00:03:12.750> this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
that what I think is good about this

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.530 
that what I think is good about this
stuff<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.480> doesn't<00:03:15.480> run<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.920> most<00:03:17.730> color

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
stuff is it doesn't run like most color

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
stuff is it doesn't run like most color
dyes<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.470> gets<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.739> your<00:03:19.860> hands<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and it comes off super easy I also

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.690 
and it comes off super easy I also
picked<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:28.380> hair<00:03:28.860> dye<00:03:29.010> remover<00:03:29.489> and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
picked up a little hair dye remover and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.030 
picked up a little hair dye remover and
you<00:03:30.690> get<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.050> off<00:03:31.170> your<00:03:31.350> skin<00:03:31.380> stuff<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you get it off your skin stuff and to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.920 
you get it off your skin stuff and to
come<00:03:32.160> off<00:03:32.280> super<00:03:32.670> easy<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.480> also<00:03:33.600> helps

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
come off super easy and it also helps

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.690 
come off super easy and it also helps
get<00:03:34.080> off<00:03:34.200> surfaces<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.770> bath<00:03:35.010> tubs<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
get off surfaces like bath tubs and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.120 
get off surfaces like bath tubs and
sinks<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.900> stuff

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.200 

I<00:03:45.040> think<00:03:46.040> that's<00:03:46.190> pretty<00:03:46.430> much<00:03:46.550> it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210
