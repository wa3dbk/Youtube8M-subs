00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.970
 all welcome from the channel distraigo 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.799
 2 video white again in the 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.799
 map the origins to explain how 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.079
 kill the final boss of this map that is 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.759
 pretty hard and it goes pretty fast 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.190
 right here I was looking for a weapon 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.080
 against the titan I took it I was 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.550
 I looking for generators to see if 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.140
 I managed to improve the sea thing that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.210
 got by whoever found a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.160
 generator so good finally I 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.570
 they have killed and the safest thing is that what 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.370
 come back try and here when I get 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.010
 here I was already in round 8 starts to 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.739
 a siren honks and appears 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.109
 this final boss that seemed to be a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.120
 kind of astronaut like that of how the 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.980
 of munt in the trailer but good and I 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.839
 I realized here that it was not that 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.089
 bug that it was something much bigger 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.280
 that they ran much more and good as 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.949
 You see, he was following me all the time 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.289
 I was trying to find that kind of 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.389
 weapon that he had in his arm and here he 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.489
 broke the glass that was in his head 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.859
 it starts to come out fire now it shoots 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.299
 the fire for a long time is like 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.679
 a kind of flamethrower that has in 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.359
 the head and well here you see that it is the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.859
 zombie with armor that you see me 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.350
 they all cornered as if there 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.810
 tomorrow I get out alive and uncle 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.270
 he kept following me he followed 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 to any place where you see the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 that outside and as I saw that I did not have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.340
 bullets in the shotgun not that either 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.899
 bullets left me anywhere there 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 You see how I was firing fire with 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.490
 the flamethrower I come and here I take myself 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 my resuscitation just in case in the matare 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.020
 and the ending in ends up killing me for 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 finish with him and well here I followed 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.200
 firing fire I kept running and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.909
 the truth is that it's pretty hard 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.619
 you have to shoot enough I recommend 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.560
 hit him in the head that has a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.170
 grenade but it stands there and I 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.179
 start to take with one with a kind 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.190
 of teleportation does not start to bring 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.959
 with a kind of gun that you see as 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.670
 he killed it comes a ball of energy that does not 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.240
 I know if it will be caught even or if 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.159
 they were simply bullets from the weapon of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.080
 resuscitation that appeared there as a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 sort of ball when they hit against 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.229
 the wall so good I hope that you 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.729
 I liked it if it comes out you know 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 start shooting him especially in the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.500
 head and now I will start to launch 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.939
 you call to chase yourself when I hope that 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.740
 you liked that it was served not 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.090
 I know what's still called a greeting to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.569
 everyone and see you in the next video 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.569
 goodbye
