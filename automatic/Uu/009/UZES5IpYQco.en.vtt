superscript drive now this is my
favorite<00:00:04.890> drive<00:00:05.220> in<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.460> series<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.940> was

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
favorite drive in this series this was

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.059 
favorite drive in this series this was
our<00:00:06.270> second<00:00:06.660> one<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> series<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.799> based

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
our second one in the series it's based

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.190 
our second one in the series it's based
on<00:00:08.220> SSD<00:00:08.880> meaning<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.360> there's<00:00:09.480> an<00:00:09.630> SSD

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
on SSD meaning and there's an SSD

eight channels of flash concurrently
that's<00:00:14.370> where<00:00:14.580> we're<00:00:14.700> able<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.150> some

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
that's where we're able to get some

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
that's where we're able to get some
really<00:00:15.690> amazing<00:00:16.139> speeds<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.369> drive<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.609> also

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
really amazing speeds this drive is also

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.820 
really amazing speeds this drive is also
