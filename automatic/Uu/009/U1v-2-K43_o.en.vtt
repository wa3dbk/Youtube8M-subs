and<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.080> he<00:02:37.290> classifies<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.340> as

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and on as well so he classifies it as

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.880 
and on as well so he classifies it as
more<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.030> light<00:02:39.360> medium<00:02:39.870> pomade<00:02:40.440> which<00:02:40.620> I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
more of a light medium pomade which I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.740 
more of a light medium pomade which I
would<00:02:41.310> agree<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> I'm<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> medium

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
would agree with so I'm more of a medium

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.180 
would agree with so I'm more of a medium
but<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:46.020> some<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.500> nice<00:02:46.740> qualities

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
but it has some really nice qualities

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.700 
but it has some really nice qualities
about<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.730> we're<00:02:47.850> gonna<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.150> into<00:02:48.360> later

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.990 

right<00:02:52.710> off<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> bat<00:02:53.100> as<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.460> can<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.850> has

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
right off the bat as you can see it has

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.990

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
a very very good shine on it but it is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.140

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
gel type wannabes and that does dole

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.080 
gel type wannabes and that does dole
away<00:03:00.390> after<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> little<00:03:01.140> while<00:03:01.700> but<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
away after a little while but that is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.360 
away after a little while but that is
not<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.480> be<00:03:03.510> mistaken<00:03:03.890> by<00:03:04.890> saying<00:03:05.190> this

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370

make my part and for how light it feels
in<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.910> hair<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:23.110> really<00:04:23.470> holds<00:04:23.620> everything

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
in the hair it really holds everything

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.710 
in the hair it really holds everything
together<00:04:24.130> very<00:04:24.760> very<00:04:24.880> well<00:04:26.669> but<00:04:27.669> still<00:04:27.820> still

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
together very very well but still still

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.830 
together very very well but still still
feels<00:04:28.990> quite<00:04:29.260> light<00:04:29.470> in<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> hair<00:04:30.600> but<00:04:31.600> if<00:04:31.720> you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
feels quite light in the hair but if you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.750 
feels quite light in the hair but if you
know<00:04:32.020> me<00:04:32.200> I<00:04:32.500> prefer<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.490> way

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
know me I prefer it that way

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.550 
know me I prefer it that way
I<00:04:35.580> am<00:04:36.580> ETSU<00:04:37.000> forming<00:04:37.300> my<00:04:37.450> pompadour

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.350 

now<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:41.860> because<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.550> feels<00:04:42.730> very<00:04:42.970> light<00:04:43.240> in

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
now as because it feels very light in

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.530 
now as because it feels very light in
the<00:04:43.419> hair<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:44.700> usually<00:04:45.700> let<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.030> sit<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.330> a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
the hair I usually let it sit for a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.140 
the hair I usually let it sit for a
little<00:04:46.660> bit<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.200> then<00:04:48.100> once<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.580> starts<00:04:48.940> to

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
little bit and then once it starts to

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.620 
little bit and then once it starts to
firm<00:04:49.690> up<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:50.020> bit<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.880> can<00:04:51.880> definitely<00:04:52.060> get<00:04:52.450> to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
firm up a bit I can definitely get to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.060 
firm up a bit I can definitely get to
styling<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.740> way<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.100> I<00:04:54.130> really<00:04:54.580> want<00:04:54.850> it

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
styling the way that I really want it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.909 
styling the way that I really want it
which<00:04:57.070> when<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.820> firms<00:04:58.300> up<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:59.500> get<00:04:59.710> more

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
which when it firms up and I get more

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.620 
which when it firms up and I get more
that<00:05:01.169> more<00:05:02.169> of<00:05:02.260> that<00:05:02.350> stiffness<00:05:02.710> in<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.630> can

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
that more of that stiffness in it I can

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.120 
that more of that stiffness in it I can
get<00:05:04.750> some<00:05:04.900> really<00:05:05.260> really<00:05:05.380> good<00:05:05.740> height<00:05:05.979> with
