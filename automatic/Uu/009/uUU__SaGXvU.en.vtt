00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.000
 how about people I am a pastor and welcome to 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.530
 a new video of animal crossing this 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.900
 time is a guide to get the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.580
 Hybridization of roses get all the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 roses of all colors available 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.670
 in the fire what good at this point 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.789
 you want will have the other rose 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.650
 hybrid if you are incipient and you do not know 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 how to get the hybrid voices here is 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.750
 I explain them 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.150
 to get the purple rose is needed 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 secure some white roses with another 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.290
 white rose that is to say you have to plant the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.660
 together as it is here this is only for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 give them the example together they can be in 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.940
 horizontally and vertically or even in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.519
 diagonal and you can get the roses 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.660
 hybrid then for the abode two 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.030
 White roses 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.900
 to take out the reds orange does not 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.579
 missing a rose 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.499
 while which 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.540
 it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it's good 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.430
 part 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.790
 to get the reason to farms and miss 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.300
 a red rose and a yellow rose 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.400
 to take out the pink rose 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.400
 a white rose and a red rose 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.250
 to take out the black rose two red roses 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.340
 and not in this little tree is a 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.620
 a delicious fruit tree 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.810
 to take out the golden rose 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.980
 you need a black rose that is 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 withered and golden watering can 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.270
 if the roses are not withered for more 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.520
 that we water it with the golden shower 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.820
 We will give this the golden rose I 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 I had to borrow a people 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 because I have thousands of black roses 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 but with the ordinance that I have 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.650
 flowers do not wither then I 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 it is impossible to get the rose 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.880
 golden 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 then withered black rose and watering can 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 golden big pink 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.990
 and the most difficult of all the blue rose 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.500
 This rose is a matter of many 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.530
 patience 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.590
 If you are an impatient person, you are not going to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.100
 do because it takes days even months in 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.800
 get out of this rose 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.590
 to get this rose what you should do 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 is to combine a white rose with another 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.330
 white rose to get a rose 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 purple combine a red rose with a 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 yellow rose so that you have a rose 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.070
 orange then this purple rose and this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.030
 orange rose you will plant them together 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.459
 to give you red roses 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.020
 I do not know that in the game we have roses 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 red to cascoporro and there are many but 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.050
 those are not going to serve us we need that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.230
 be red roses 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.480
 born of a purple rose with a rose 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.690
 orange then we plant two of those 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 roses and we will get the blue rose 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
 As I tell you, it's the most complicated 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.120
 Do not leave a blue rose but already 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.780
 leaving the 1 is easier than us 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.490
 come out more 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.069
 but I really spent two months 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.280
 I had been waiting for two months 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.740
 too late there is another theory of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.230
 animal crossing games past 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.850
 proposes that if you plant a purple rose 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.250
 with a black rose you'll also give 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.569
 a rose are but how do I tell you that is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.600
 of past games I can not 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.110
 confirm that this works 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.650
 for I the method it is pink 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.300
 purple and pink orange red and pink roses 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.030
 reds born of purple and pink rose 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.040
 orange they give blue rose but this had not 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.580
 proven that sembrem also 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.820
 lots of roses in it, let's see what 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.820
 wants 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.650
 that the new values 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.650
 his personality 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.980
 it's my favorite hundred to ignore it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.609
 ok then I would tell them in games of 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.439
 past animation planting a rose 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.599
 purple with roses black rose 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.090
 blue I do not know if this works in this 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.560
 completely deigned game as I say 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.320
 I already try it opens a lot 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.960
 purple roses with black roses but 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.470
 none gave me the result so much 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.600
 It's also a matter of patience 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.930
 I'm moving the camera a lot and you have to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.000
 wait too long for it to come out 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.729
 but hey there's an easy way to co2 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.180
 good easy in quotes to get 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.210
 hybrid flowers and that's with these two 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.250
 wells we can use a snow flower 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.590
 sowing the fence of our roses that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.740
 they are going to give the hybrid and a snow flower 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.479
 facilitates obtaining hybrid roses 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.220
 Snow flowers are available 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.770
 having the perfect town for several 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.270
 days and solitas begin to sprout 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.639
 we also have the option of 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.629
 fertilizer the fertilizer just what 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.009
 we get 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.500
 if we have the latest extension of the 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.900
 shop then if they are newbies because I doubt 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.550
 much you have it but well this is 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.580
 another method on land the fertilizer 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.599
 near the flowers that are going to shine 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.800
 because you expect them to shine and give 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.930
 odds that you get out of the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.849
 factory will not always leave you 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.009
 they increase the odds but you do not 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.639
 ensures nothing then it is a subject a 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.639
 Tidy complicated 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.360
 then this is the hybridization of roses 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.030
 If you have any questions write in the 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.500
 comment box or in the community of 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.630
 facebook that we have here on the channel 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.900
 below I leave the link to facebook 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.760
 and well for now this is all not 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.670
 I show the other hybrid flowers the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.200
 cosmos the violas the violets and the 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.270
 tulips because I still do not have them all 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.090
 but as soon as I have them I will make a video 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.610
 with the hybridization of the other flowers 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.710
 and as soon as I can 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:05.189
 for now that's all, thank you very much 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.189
 to see until the next video and goodbye
