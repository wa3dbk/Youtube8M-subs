I<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.100> where<00:01:23.460> everything<00:01:23.939> sticks<00:01:24.210> out

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I can see where everything sticks out

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
I can see where everything sticks out
that<00:01:24.630> didn't<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.350> stick<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.860> much

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that didn't do that stick out that much

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
that didn't do that stick out that much
before<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> together<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.450> before<00:01:27.600> was

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
before did this together much before was
