00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
rifle a one or spra one this started out

rifle a one or spra one this started out
as<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> project<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.190> worked<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.820> government

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
as a project I worked on in government

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.549 
as a project I worked on in government
and<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.800> brought<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.520> industry<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.180> me

and then brought into industry with me
the<00:00:46.559> difference<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> rifle<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the difference with this rifle is that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.100 
the difference with this rifle is that
we<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> single<00:00:50.329> sighting<00:00:51.329> plane<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
we have a single sighting plane or a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
we have a single sighting plane or a
rail<00:00:52.350> plane<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> top<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
rail plane up at the top this is not a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.779 
rail plane up at the top this is not a
two-piece<00:00:55.020> system<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> one-piece<00:00:56.370> system

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
two-piece system it's a one-piece system

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
two-piece system it's a one-piece system
what's<00:00:57.600> different<00:00:58.109> about<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.219> we've<00:00:59.579> got

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
what's different about this is we've got

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.689 
what's different about this is we've got
a<00:00:59.789> technology<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> allows<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:02.010> efficient

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
a technology that allows very efficient

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.810 
a technology that allows very efficient
production<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.500> long<00:01:04.830> forging<00:01:05.580> that's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
production of this long forging that's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
production of this long forging that's
used<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> price<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.140> very<00:01:07.500> reasonable

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
used so the price is very reasonable

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.060 
used so the price is very reasonable
compared<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> competition<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.900> addition<00:01:10.470> each

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
compared to competition in addition each

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
compared to competition in addition each
of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:11.760> three<00:01:12.150> rails<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:13.380> be

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of the other three rails can be

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.300 
of the other three rails can be
individually<00:01:13.830> removed<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> replaced<00:01:15.119> with

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
individually removed and replaced with

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
individually removed and replaced with
other<00:01:17.310> optional<00:01:17.880> devices<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:19.560> gives<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
other optional devices it gives you a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
other optional devices it gives you a
rifle<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.939> only<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.390> stable<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
rifle that not only is stable and can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.289 
rifle that not only is stable and can
handle<00:01:22.909> night<00:01:23.909> object<00:01:24.500> optics<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.650> instance

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
handle night object optics for instance

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
handle night object optics for instance
but<00:01:27.299> you've<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.570> flexibility<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> way

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but you've got flexibility all the way

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.490 
but you've got flexibility all the way
around<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.100> front<00:01:29.340> end<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.600> new<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.290> is
