anything like that
Oh<00:02:23.240> in<00:02:23.450> my<00:02:23.630> practice<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:24.260> do<00:02:24.380> any<00:02:24.560> tests<00:02:25.130> I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
Oh in my practice I don't do any tests I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.490 
Oh in my practice I don't do any tests I
just<00:02:25.520> speak<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:26.030> people<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.480> listen<00:02:27.380> to

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
just speak with people and listen to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.010 
just speak with people and listen to
them<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.220> make<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> decision<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.390> what

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
them and then I make a decision in what

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.530 
them and then I make a decision in what
kind<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.560> illness<00:02:30.709> should<00:02:31.520> be<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.420> don't

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
kind of illness should be here we don't

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.160 
kind of illness should be here we don't
