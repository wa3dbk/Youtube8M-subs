have my refugium and then I've got my
return<00:01:46.849> pump<00:01:47.179> in<00:01:47.389> this<00:01:47.569> section<00:01:47.840> I've<00:01:48.409> got<00:01:48.679> a

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
return pump in this section I've got a

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.469 
return pump in this section I've got a
bubble<00:01:49.310> trap<00:01:49.609> here<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:51.999> right<00:01:52.999> here<00:01:53.029> I'm

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
bubble trap here and right here I'm

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.580 
bubble trap here and right here I'm
going<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.719> hopefully<00:01:54.049> put<00:01:54.499> in<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:56.590> sm-3

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
going to hopefully put in a a sm-3

going to hopefully put in a a sm-3
skimmer<00:01:58.929> got<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.679> dual<00:02:01.149> overflows<00:02:02.149> coming

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
skimmer got the dual overflows coming

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.639 
skimmer got the dual overflows coming
down<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.989> right<00:02:03.169> here<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:06.079> yeah<00:02:06.319> that's

kind of my design really want to do a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.780 
kind of my design really want to do a
refugium<00:02:10.729> so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
refugium so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.509 
refugium so

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
know exactly how set that up overflow I

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.539 
know exactly how set that up overflow I
got<00:02:15.819> off<00:02:15.969> a<00:02:16.680> guy<00:02:19.349> like<00:02:20.349> 20<00:02:20.829> bucks<00:02:21.099> which<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.400> a

killer deal and stop the duel I painted
it<00:02:28.299> black<00:02:28.689> and<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.170> comes<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:33.370> over<00:02:33.790> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
it black and it just comes on over and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
it black and it just comes on over and
down<00:02:34.269> through<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:38.370> return

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
down through there and this is my return

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:51.410 
down through there and this is my return
right<00:02:41.950> here<00:02:42.370> some<00:02:43.180> inch<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.719> half<00:02:43.750> PVC

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.229 

right<00:02:52.420> there<00:02:52.659> then<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.379> that<00:02:53.409> I<00:02:53.860> guess<00:02:54.670> we'll

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
right there then so that I guess we'll

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.979 
right there then so that I guess we'll
jump<00:02:55.810> my<00:02:56.019> pressure<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:56.709> right<00:02:57.099> at<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.400> end

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
jump my pressure up right at the end

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.539 
jump my pressure up right at the end
while<00:02:58.989> still<00:02:59.200> giving<00:02:59.470> me<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.769> lot<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.040> flow

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
while still giving me a lot more flow

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.660
