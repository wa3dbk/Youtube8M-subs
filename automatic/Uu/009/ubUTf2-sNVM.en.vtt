in<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:20.179> last<00:00:20.390> lesson<00:00:20.599> that<00:00:20.779> we<00:00:20.990> removed<00:00:21.380> two

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
in the last lesson that we removed two

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.589 
in the last lesson that we removed two
branches<00:00:22.369> that<00:00:22.429> were<00:00:22.699> coming<00:00:23.000> off<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.329> trunk

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
branches that were coming off the trunk

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.130 
branches that were coming off the trunk
at<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:24.529> wrong<00:00:24.710> angle<00:00:25.210> now<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:26.269> will<00:00:26.840> tackle

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
at the wrong angle now we will tackle

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.330 
at the wrong angle now we will tackle
the<00:00:27.500> all<00:00:28.250> important<00:00:28.849> detail<00:00:29.570> pruning<00:00:30.340> this

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
the all important detail pruning this

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.090 
the all important detail pruning this
pruning<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:31.849> important<00:00:32.540> because<00:00:33.100> it

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
pruning is important because it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.780 
pruning is important because it
establishes<00:00:34.839> wood<00:00:35.839> that<00:00:36.379> will<00:00:36.620> support<00:00:37.489> our

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
establishes wood that will support our

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.530 
establishes wood that will support our
fruit<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:39.559> area<00:00:39.890> circled<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.790> prime<00:00:41.239> area

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
fruit the area circled is a prime area

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.100 
fruit the area circled is a prime area
for<00:00:41.750> fruit<00:00:42.350> development<00:00:43.629> this<00:00:44.629> is<00:00:44.839> where

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
for fruit development this is where

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.110 
for fruit development this is where
intelligent<00:00:45.829> pruning<00:00:46.159> cuts<00:00:46.430> will<00:00:46.699> increase

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
intelligent pruning cuts will increase

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.069 
intelligent pruning cuts will increase
fruit<00:00:47.479> production<00:00:48.340> further<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:49.809> there<00:00:50.809> won't

for<00:00:59.570> holding<00:00:59.899> our<00:01:00.019> fruit<00:01:00.289> should<00:01:00.739> be

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
for holding our fruit should be

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.499 
for holding our fruit should be
developed<00:01:01.429> on<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.480> sides<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.890> branch

developed on the sides of the branch

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.100 
developed on the sides of the branch
there's<00:01:05.509> two<00:01:05.899> reasons<00:01:06.350> for<00:01:06.860> this<00:01:07.690> first<00:01:08.690> the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
there's two reasons for this first the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.590 
there's two reasons for this first the
SAP<00:01:09.350> flow<00:01:09.710> along<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.850> side<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.360> leader

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
SAP flow along the side of the leader

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.130 
SAP flow along the side of the leader
has<00:01:11.929> been<00:01:11.960> shown<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.410> produce<00:01:12.800> more<00:01:13.399> fruit

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
has been shown to produce more fruit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.590 
has been shown to produce more fruit

our original laterals we should

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.430 
our original laterals we should
visualize<00:01:39.830> how<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:41.270> can<00:01:41.479> fill<00:01:41.780> up<00:01:41.959> as<00:01:42.170> much

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
visualize how we can fill up as much

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.309 
visualize how we can fill up as much

fruit and leaves again the secondary
laterals<00:01:49.849> should<00:01:50.090> come<00:01:50.300> off<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.869> sides<00:01:51.170> of

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
laterals should come off the sides of

laterals should come off the sides of
the<00:01:51.800> original<00:01:51.890> laterals<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:53.390> up<00:01:53.720> or<00:01:54.229> not<00:01:54.530> down

the original laterals not up or not down

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.219 
the original laterals not up or not down
and<00:01:55.160> these<00:01:55.789> secondary<00:01:56.360> laterals<00:01:56.840> should<00:01:57.080> be

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
and these secondary laterals should be

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.680 
and these secondary laterals should be
kept<00:01:57.530> considerably<00:01:58.369> shorter<00:01:58.940> than<00:01:59.420> our
