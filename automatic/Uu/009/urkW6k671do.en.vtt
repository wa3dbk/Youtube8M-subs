00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.470
 but how welcome is this 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.690
 p the asad cleft I think it's already number 10 in the saga of 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 after all all is that I have in my time 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.559
 I hope he comes back 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 are going to be there is going to be another one even after this one the truth is that I do not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.769
 he 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.470
 but owen 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.339
 so let's continue with this 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.569
 by the way this next 'tweet' is pretty simple pretty fast 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.730
 simply what the only thing that it does is it adds a serious atmosphere 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.509
 Well yes no no I do not have another way of explaining it 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 retail issue your nickname 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 p 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.829
 of the last nest is here and in the next one is in this scheme 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.170
 this 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.539
 So, all you have to do is 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:51.810
 slide 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 i therefore its icons to whom seriousness and 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.250
 and they start to bounce 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.650
 i 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.070
 even so 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 can they actually give the brief 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.210
 so that they open 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 close it and the gravity is removed 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 I can also change that option that the Sanskrit does not activate 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 when they are 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.370
 severity mode 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.980
 all this is done via adjustments because I did not give them any icon in their 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.210
 thing of these 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.220
 will grow on your screen 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.170
 it's via act and peron 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.620
 as I had told you 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.600
 here is the town and because that's the name 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.590
 then you are good 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.980
 here they have the activation modes 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.410
 the one that will come down will lower this 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.930
 but they do not have the active but do not worry 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 when you download these you lower the activity 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.070
 so well here I put that precise when sliding under the bar 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.380
 state will happen that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.939
 but not because it has many options here and that you already know 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.020
 if they had gone past 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.409
 then good achilles select if they can enter application be in mode 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.160
 serious 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.140
 p 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.510
 that gravity mode is closed when you click on the jong button 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.930
 e that is and the changes of high severity are also added the icons of the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.709
 rock 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.969
 apparently the juli 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.789
 this bonus 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.939
 is itself all the information that is on the screen of the iphone normally 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.189
 here is good 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.539
 the 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.909
 the options of these two 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.019
 the icons 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.249
 how much frictional when one with eight ccaa with another 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.229
 the decade density and with a horns of the icons 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.109
 this 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.709
 and which the icons so remotely when in gravity mode 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.179
 well here they also have 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 to select the type of severity 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.619
 as if he were on earth 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:56.840
 build love 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.399
 the moon as if they were in space like this without truth 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.679
 or can you choose the severity of the recommend 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.679
 honestly do not put very high numbers because one can 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.799
 in happening bad things with their icons they were not lowered of the epoc but it is 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.799
 better not to do it 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.749
 and good this god thing 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.509
 to make gravity produced by your finger, so when you're touching the 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:23.539
 screen 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.770
 in which the icons 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.429
 or go to your finger 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.429
 we have a fart repels the psychological 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.510
 this peace 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.639
 It works so well and it should be fun 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.739
 this for good the touch screen has 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.199
 then flight 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.679
 simply 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.689
 well let's go to syria 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.659
 oude mind 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.379
 I leave the link of the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.019
 December 4 points 2 points one finally need it you do not have and do not 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:53.900
 they already have the country 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.929
 I doubt you do not have it you are seeing this 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:01.449
 this but if we do not have it there I leave the link of 4 points point 1 and without 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.099
 cite it in the 4 point you can not 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.579
 you can not go by mail or we can fall into carral 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.199
 percent 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.889
 is a world tooth that is an example in mind talking about the tie break 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.220
 and another one that is the tutorial of the bric 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.979
 that is, they have to do 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.979
 and well then you're in charge and all you have to do is look 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 bradl 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.319
 free 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.909
 he needs very little business time final bortoli costs 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.719
 the one of dic vos 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.829
 I do not have this being an application to pay the master 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.070
 fungi would not pay for this would pay for things like the very cordial display 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.539
 but not for this one 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.570
 because good really is not 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.090
 so table and 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.190
 then of being it to come down of two different bodies that at least I know 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.870
 that work are at this point that haxa máis puntocom 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.930
 oo there he got his hip hop dotcom the being that this one even work 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.889
 extends 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.250
 the answer is I still recommend to those who do not 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.880
 because many times the things well the argument so that they are wrong 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.029
 raised 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:16.360
 i well if it is installed there it was docked you can fuck them swat by the 

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:17.860
 truth is yes 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.409
 well then you a cáceres 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.969
 touch him 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.099
 I sew this 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.550
 install 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.870
 disappear this 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.970
 and they confirm it 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.030
 I remember them 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.089
 this shtick 283 kilograms 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.009
 tells them how much RAM ram 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.259
 use of your bow 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.419
 joan font 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.349
 this is this chip number delivered hits a kilo ballet 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.540
 a kilo before good 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.749
 thousandth of a megabit 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.870
 but still while more packages are installing that occupy ram then 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.919
 more ram are 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.009
 obviously 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.710
 but hey it does not take much to say for what he does and I think that only the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.789
 cocu bread while in use or the systolic application is open on 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.669
 the program oceans and they are not 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.749
 in gravity mode the icons 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.219
 does not occupy the ram that says there 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.189
 this monkey 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.740
 nothing else was that 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.990
 so good for now 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.639
 that is not agreed not only we are missing 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.099
 a 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.949
 how do you love 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.319
 one more video 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.659
 p she does not know in which bo and bought 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.029
 although I suppose created like in 10 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.509
 then next in the eleven the truth I do not trust much in the Pyrenees what 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.889
 I tell them now 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.220
 p me not 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.259
 moyano remembered very well but I'm going 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.650
 This one has many videos recorded in less than 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.169
 four hours 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.270
 and I've already uploaded the six videos of this 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.439
 percent 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.499
 two nights so 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:56.830
 Well, I can not think very well 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.190
 but good this then 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.800
 I just think I'm missing one 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.159
 and then see the pillars will be 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:06.419
 I believe that all 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.680
 kliksberg that there is in me at all 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.840
 has as it is I am the least courage wenlock red I remember the description 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.129
 call which cited the others because being in the throat 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.400
 this New York team explained
