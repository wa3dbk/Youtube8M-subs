shape and I that's one of the reasons

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.860 
shape and I that's one of the reasons
why<00:00:39.989> he<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> candidate<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:42.270> met

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
the criteria because of his background

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.010 
the criteria because of his background
his<00:00:45.690> background<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.530> evaluating<00:00:47.370> talent<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
his background is evaluating talent and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.650 
his background is evaluating talent and

that's critical in our vision and and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's critical in our vision and and
that's<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.199> we're<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.559> better

that playing sound fundamental defense

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
that playing sound fundamental defense
well<00:01:26.549> positioned<00:01:27.150> defensive<00:01:27.720> hockey<00:01:27.930> doesn't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
well positioned defensive hockey doesn't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.429

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to have success so that's not going to

critical decisions to make and and it's
it's<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.760> Jim<00:02:20.030> fully<00:02:20.300> recognizes<00:02:21.050> that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
things so it's a good question because

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.690 
things so it's a good question because
I've<00:03:09.530> been<00:03:09.650> asked<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.010> few<00:03:10.250> times<00:03:10.280> well<00:03:10.610> if

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
I've been asked that a few times well if

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.069 
I've been asked that a few times well if
you<00:03:10.790> go<00:03:10.880> over<00:03:10.910> there<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.360> copy<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.810> because

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
you go over there and copy that because

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.500 
you go over there and copy that because
everyone<00:03:12.440> thinks<00:03:12.680> now<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.370> Montreal<00:03:14.299> beat

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
everyone thinks now that Montreal beat

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.920 
Boston at the Boston model doesn't work
anymore<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.549> can't<00:03:16.640> do<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:16.970> because<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.900> know

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
anymore I can't do that because you know

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 
anymore I can't do that because you know
Montreal's<00:03:18.620> speedy<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.670> quick<00:03:19.880> and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
Montreal's speedy and quick and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
everything else so I don't know that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.819 
everything else so I don't know that
it's<00:03:22.340> really<00:03:22.700> copying<00:03:23.630> some<00:03:24.139> team<00:03:24.470> because

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
it's really copying some team because

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.800 
it's really copying some team because

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
that's the model and let's face it in

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.949 
that's the model and let's face it in
Detroit<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.280> lose<00:03:28.459> nicklas<00:03:28.910> lidstrom
