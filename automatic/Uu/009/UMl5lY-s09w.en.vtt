on<00:00:05.460> our<00:00:06.000> plaque<00:00:06.560> you<00:00:07.560> know<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.799> don't<00:00:08.040> want<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
on our plaque you know you don't want to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.330 
on our plaque you know you don't want to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
cut your picture without having a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.150 
cut your picture without having a
pattern<00:00:11.730> first<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.570> we'll<00:00:13.080> make<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> pattern

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
pattern first so we'll make a pattern

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
pattern first so we'll make a pattern
I'm<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.849> make<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.240> want<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> heart

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I'm going to make I want to make a heart

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
I'm going to make I want to make a heart
inside<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.520> heart<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.420> want<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> be

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
inside the heart and I want it to be

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.349 
inside the heart and I want it to be
symmetrical<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> fold<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.310> paper<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.060> half

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
symmetrical so I fold my paper in half

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.029 
symmetrical so I fold my paper in half
I'm<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> estimate<00:00:23.240> what<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> think

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
I'm just going to estimate what I think

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.840 
I'm just going to estimate what I think
will<00:00:26.039> work<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.060> cut<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.820> see<00:00:32.820> how

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
will work and cut that out and see how

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.790 
will work and cut that out and see how
it<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.540> looks<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.140> now<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.350> looks<00:00:34.680> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to the light you can see the faces

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830 
to the light you can see the faces
through<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> placement<00:01:20.840> exactly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
cut around the pattern okay and then all

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
cut around the pattern okay and then all
you<00:01:28.320> need<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.130> glue<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.150> onto<00:01:30.570> your
