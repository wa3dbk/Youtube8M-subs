grooves<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.900> think<00:01:42.259> we<00:01:42.470> have<00:01:42.770> two<00:01:43.130> right

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
grooves and I think we have two right

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.190 
grooves and I think we have two right
now<00:01:43.700> they<00:01:44.090> would<00:01:44.240> like<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.479> get<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.990> third

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
groove but I think it's gonna take a

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.370 
groove but I think it's gonna take a
little<00:01:46.790> time<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.570> get<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.899> high<00:01:48.080> groove
