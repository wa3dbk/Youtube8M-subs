00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
few of them are not but also it looks

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.150 
few of them are not but also it looks
cool<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.000> plus<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.750> are<00:02:59.780> reload<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.920> shell

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
cool and plus we are reload the shell

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.460 
cool and plus we are reload the shell
pops<00:03:01.459> out<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.510> cool<00:03:02.780> looking<00:03:03.170> like

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
pops out so it's so cool looking like

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.699 
pops out so it's so cool looking like
that<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:05.780> course<00:03:05.959> my<00:03:06.049> friend<00:03:06.200> calls<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
that of course my friend calls it a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.740 
that of course my friend calls it a
repeater<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.489> don't<00:03:07.670> know<00:03:07.760> why<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:08.120> calls<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
repeater I don't know why he calls it

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.330 
repeater I don't know why he calls it
that<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.819> it's<00:03:11.630> pretty<00:03:11.780> cool

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.720 

ASV<00:03:16.640> one<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.799> don't<00:03:18.799> know<00:03:19.010> why<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> chose<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.670> is

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
ASV one I don't know why I chose this is

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.580 
ASV one I don't know why I chose this is
three<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.420> think<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.170> well

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
three but I think that's because well

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.309 
three but I think that's because well
you<00:03:22.250> only<00:03:22.340> get<00:03:22.519> one<00:03:22.760> bullet<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.329> mean<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.200> know

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
you only get one bullet I mean you know

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.490 
you only get one bullet I mean you know
in<00:03:24.920> like<00:03:25.959> fighting<00:03:26.959> they<00:03:27.110> are<00:03:27.290> shooting

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
in like fighting they are shooting

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.650 
in like fighting they are shooting
shooter<00:03:28.160> game<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.790> would<00:03:28.940> usually<00:03:29.180> get<00:03:29.480> like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
shooter game you would usually get like

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.680 
shooter game you would usually get like
20<00:03:30.349> rockets<00:03:30.880> compared<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.000> one<00:03:32.209> rocket<00:03:32.599> in

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
20 rockets compared to one rocket in

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.920 
20 rockets compared to one rocket in
real<00:03:32.870> life<00:03:34.060> kids<00:03:35.060> are<00:03:39.190> really<00:03:40.190> far<00:03:40.489> but<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
real life kids are really far but the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.410 
real life kids are really far but the
reload<00:03:42.290> time<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.590> excellent<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.910> all<00:03:44.239> this

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
reload time is excellent and all this

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.210 
reload time is excellent and all this
other<00:03:44.569> jets<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.049> like<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.380> said<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
other jets but like I said the the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.680 
other jets but like I said the the
rocket<00:03:49.549> launchers<00:03:49.910> are<00:03:50.030> not<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.269> good<00:03:50.480> with

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
rocket launchers are not that good with

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.809 
rocket launchers are not that good with
ammo<00:03:50.989> because<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:52.069> one<00:03:52.190> comes<00:03:52.370> with<00:03:52.430> one

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
ammo because that one comes with one

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.259 
ammo because that one comes with one
rocket<00:03:53.799> next<00:03:54.799> up<00:03:55.040> from<00:03:55.190> number<00:03:55.430> two<00:03:55.579> is<00:03:55.850> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
rocket next up from number two is the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.680 
rocket next up from number two is the
long<00:03:56.600> strike<00:03:56.959> cs6<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:58.209> joke<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.359> because<00:03:59.600> it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
long strike cs6 I joke this because it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.990 
long strike cs6 I joke this because it
looks<00:03:59.870> like<00:03:59.989> an<00:04:00.170> awesome<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.790> for<00:04:01.940> the

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.100 
let's just just reminds me of sniper
rifle<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:44.110> we're<00:04:45.110> gonna<00:04:45.289> do<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:46.099> have<00:04:46.310> last

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110

rifle so we're gonna do we have last
number<00:04:48.110> one<00:04:48.349> the<00:04:49.159> Vulcan<00:04:49.599> approach<00:04:50.599> this<00:04:50.719> is

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
number one the Vulcan approach this is

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.140 
number one the Vulcan approach this is
my<00:04:51.050> opinion<00:04:51.500> my<00:04:51.770> top<00:04:52.009> five<00:04:52.250> nerf<00:04:52.460> guns<00:04:52.699> that<00:04:53.060> I

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
my opinion my top five nerf guns that I

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.119 
my opinion my top five nerf guns that I
currently<00:04:53.360> have<00:04:53.569> right<00:04:53.870> now<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.319> would<00:04:55.099> have

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
currently have right now I would have

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.439 
currently have right now I would have
gone<00:04:55.340> through<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.729> Stampede<00:04:56.180> little

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
gone through like the Stampede little

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.330 
gone through like the Stampede little
swarm<00:04:56.689> fire<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.319> I<00:04:57.500> don't<00:04:57.770> have<00:04:57.919> those<00:04:58.129> right

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
swarm fire but I don't have those right

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.369 
swarm fire but I don't have those right
now

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
now

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:04.089 
now
so<00:05:00.379> basically<00:05:01.870> Vulcan<00:05:02.870> very<00:05:03.259> awesome<00:05:03.740> looks

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
so basically Vulcan very awesome looks

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.279 
so basically Vulcan very awesome looks
like<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.280> machine<00:05:04.699> gun

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
like a machine gun

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.529 
like a machine gun
what<00:05:06.289> is<00:05:06.439> a<00:05:06.469> machine<00:05:06.830> gun<00:05:07.009> but<00:05:07.039> it's<00:05:07.310> also<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.699> it

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
what is a machine gun but it's also a it

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.020 
what is a machine gun but it's also a it
also<00:05:08.810> looks<00:05:09.050> like<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.379> minigun<00:05:09.979> which<00:05:10.909> is

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
also looks like a minigun which is

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.189 
also looks like a minigun which is
