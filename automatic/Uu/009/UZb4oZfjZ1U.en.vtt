so you know we're taking a little bit of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.120 
so you know we're taking a little bit of
a<00:02:01.020> risk<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.320> i<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.560> these<00:02:01.649> characters<00:02:02.040> are

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a risk but i think these characters are

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
a risk but i think these characters are
so<00:02:02.280> strong<00:02:02.520> though<00:02:02.820> they'll<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.479> very

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so strong though they'll be very

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
so strong though they'll be very
successful<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> show<00:02:05.070> has

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
successful and also that the show has

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
successful and also that the show has
