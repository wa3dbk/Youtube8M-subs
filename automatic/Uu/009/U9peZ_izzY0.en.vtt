for the ager hose this is a freeze ho
similar<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> Maya<00:00:10.500> freeze<00:00:11.690> according<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
similar to the Maya freeze according to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.629 
similar to the Maya freeze according to
all<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.900> statistics<00:00:13.110> I've<00:00:13.559> seen<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.009> far<00:00:14.340> this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.810 
all the statistics I've seen so far this
is<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.000> washable<00:00:15.450> hose<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.400> hope<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.670> that's

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
is a washable hose I hope that that's

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.120 
is a washable hose I hope that that's
true<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.539> should<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> really<00:00:19.199> try<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> only

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
true it should be I really try to only

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
true it should be I really try to only
order<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:20.670> vendors<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.539> find<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> be

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
order from vendors that I find to be

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.620 
order from vendors that I find to be
reputable<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.519> who<00:00:23.730> aren't<00:00:23.970> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> lie<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
reputable and who aren't going to lie to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.429 
reputable and who aren't going to lie to
me<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:26.640> gauge<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.119> pretty<00:00:27.510> thick<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.170> draw<00:00:28.410> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
me the gauge is pretty thick the draw is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
me the gauge is pretty thick the draw is
pretty<00:00:28.800> nice<00:00:29.010> I'd<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:29.730> put<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.150> little

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
pretty nice I'd actually put it a little

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
pretty nice I'd actually put it a little
bit<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:30.869> restricted<00:00:31.470> than<00:00:31.500> something<00:00:31.920> like

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
bit more restricted than something like

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.060 
bit more restricted than something like
a<00:00:32.189> new<00:00:32.610> more<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.170> still<00:00:34.410> nice<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:34.950> open

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.979 

but<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.510> restricted

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
but it is a little little bit restricted

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.540 
but it is a little little bit restricted
I<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.860> smoked<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.399> without<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.200> insert<00:00:46.200> in

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
I have smoked this without the insert in

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.840 
I have smoked this without the insert in
and<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.809> didn't<00:00:49.079> change<00:00:49.260> anything

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
and it really didn't change anything

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
and it really didn't change anything
happily<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:53.670> comes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
happily as you can see here it comes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
happily as you can see here it comes
with<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.329> insert<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with an insert that you put into the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
with an insert that you put into the
freezer<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:58.699> then<00:00:59.699> put<00:01:00.000> inside<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.510> hoes

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
freezer and then put inside your hoes

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.390 
freezer and then put inside your hoes
like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.430> simple<00:01:03.049> close<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like that very simple close it up as a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
like that very simple close it up as a
nice<00:01:05.790> silicone<00:01:06.119> seal<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.260> seals

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
nice silicone seal here that seals

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
nice silicone seal here that seals
pretty<00:01:08.189> well<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.640> only<00:01:09.119> had<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.600> issue<00:01:09.869> where

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pretty well I only had one issue where

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
pretty well I only had one issue where
it<00:01:10.229> didn't<00:01:10.439> seal<00:01:10.560> properly<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> realized<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it didn't seal properly but I realized I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
it didn't seal properly but I realized I
haven't<00:01:11.790> tightened<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> down<00:01:12.840> entirely<00:01:16.549> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
haven't tightened it down entirely it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.399 
haven't tightened it down entirely it
cools<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> smoke<00:01:17.970> pretty<00:01:18.420> nicely<00:01:18.630> um<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
cools the smoke pretty nicely um the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.770 
cools the smoke pretty nicely um the
insert<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.740> only<00:01:22.890> lasts<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
insert really only lasts for about a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
insert really only lasts for about a
half<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> session<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.799> you're<00:01:25.950> doing<00:01:26.310> anything

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
half a session if you're doing anything

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.560 
half a session if you're doing anything
more<00:01:26.820> than<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> half<00:01:27.420> hour<00:01:27.600> session<00:01:28.110> um

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
more than like a half hour session um

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
more than like a half hour session um
it's<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.409> effective<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.070> cooling<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's good it's effective at cooling it's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.800 
it's good it's effective at cooling it's
not<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> give<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.150> frostbite<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.720> your

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
not going to give you frostbite in your

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
not going to give you frostbite in your
lungs<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.170> anything<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> does

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
lungs or anything like that but it does

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.920 
lungs or anything like that but it does
cool<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> could<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.750> being

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
cool it down which I could see being

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.730 
cool it down which I could see being
really<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.610> hot<00:01:38.820> summer<00:01:39.180> day

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.859 

now<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.610> hose<00:01:44.850> does<00:01:45.149> come<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.630> two

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
now because this hose does come with two

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.770 
now because this hose does come with two
of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.710> inserts<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:48.240> switch<00:01:48.539> them<00:01:48.659> out

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of the inserts you can switch them out

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
of the inserts you can switch them out
very<00:01:49.110> quickly<00:01:49.289> very<00:01:49.680> easily<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.729> grab

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
very quickly very easily you just grab

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160 
very quickly very easily you just grab
the<00:01:51.000> new<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.270> stick<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.930> put<00:01:52.140> the
