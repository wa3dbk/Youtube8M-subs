see<00:00:47.450> how<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:50.230> hopefully<00:00:51.230> how<00:00:51.590> we'll

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
see how and that is hopefully how we'll

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.979 
see how and that is hopefully how we'll
need<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.010> use<00:00:52.160> any<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:52.750> sock<00:00:53.750> could<00:00:53.900> we

need to use any of this sock could we

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.500 
need to use any of this sock could we
turn<00:00:54.200> it<00:00:54.440> there<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.579> look<00:00:55.790> kind<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.000> bad<00:00:56.120> to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
turn it there you look kind of bad to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.080 
turn it there you look kind of bad to
two<00:00:57.280> different<00:00:58.280> tube<00:00:58.910> sizes<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.850> me<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.970> see

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
two different tube sizes so me to see

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.249 
two different tube sizes so me to see
how<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.300> goes<00:01:03.909> okay<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:05.210> managed<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:06.049> all

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
how it goes okay I managed to get all

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.050 
how it goes okay I managed to get all
three<00:01:06.649> radiators<00:01:07.280> installed<00:01:08.380> ran<00:01:09.380> into<00:01:10.060> three

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
three radiators installed ran into three

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.480 
three radiators installed ran into three
problems<00:01:11.889> first<00:01:12.889> thing<00:01:13.039> I<00:01:13.100> had<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.219> do<00:01:13.399> is

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
problems first thing I had to do is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.279 
problems first thing I had to do is
elongate<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.030> holes<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.539> top<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.929> here<00:01:15.020> stock

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
elongate the holes on top of here stock

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.440 
elongate the holes on top of here stock
of<00:01:15.409> mood<00:01:15.590> it's<00:01:15.770> ready<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.009> order<00:01:16.159> over<00:01:16.460> two

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
of mood it's ready to order over two

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.109 
of mood it's ready to order over two
millimeters<00:01:18.139> and<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.850> bad<00:01:20.030> idea<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.689> put<00:01:20.719> a

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
millimeters and the bad idea to put a

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.699 
millimeters and the bad idea to put a
sixty<00:01:23.119> millimeter<00:01:23.329> 360<00:01:24.200> radiator<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:24.649> the

managed to get all my water cooling
components<00:02:06.860> installed<00:02:08.140> now<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.910> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
components installed now I have to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.820 
components installed now I have to
figure<00:02:11.240> out<00:02:11.450> how<00:02:11.690> I'm<00:02:11.840> gonna<00:02:12.050> run<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> tubing

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
figure out how I'm gonna run the tubing

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.310 
figure out how I'm gonna run the tubing
I<00:02:12.980> have<00:02:13.250> some<00:02:13.430> ideas<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.080> come

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
I have some ideas that this one come

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960 
I have some ideas that this one come
around<00:02:15.500> here

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
around here

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.460 
around here
this<00:02:17.720> will<00:02:22.600> that's<00:02:23.600> what<00:02:23.690> I'm<00:02:23.810> thinking<00:02:24.290> but

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
this will that's what I'm thinking but

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.640 
this will that's what I'm thinking but
we'll<00:02:25.400> see<00:02:25.640> how<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.790> works<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:29.290> ok<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.320> have

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
we'll see how it works out ok I have

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.790 
we'll see how it works out ok I have
completed<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.430> loop<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.380> came<00:02:33.530> out

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
completed the loop actually it came out

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.640 
completed the loop actually it came out
better<00:02:34.070> than<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.430> thought<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:34.850> would<00:02:35.210> I<00:02:35.650> started

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
better than I thought it would I started

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.220 
better than I thought it would I started
from<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:36.950> radiator<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> pump<00:02:38.270> from<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
from this radiator to the pump from the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.290 
from this radiator to the pump from the
pump<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.920> its<00:02:40.070> reservoir<00:02:40.730> from<00:02:41.060> this

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
pump to its reservoir from this

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.020 
pump to its reservoir from this
reservoir<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:42.740> this<00:02:42.950> radiator<00:02:43.459> from<00:02:43.730> this
