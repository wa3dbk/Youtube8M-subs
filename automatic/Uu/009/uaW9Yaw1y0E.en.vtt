00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.730
 That's how she played us exactly five years ago 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.219
 to the pc games hardware 3 2005 and the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.260
 was not an exhausting issue 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.869
 for us but for you the readers the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 through 14 pc workshops too 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 work had themes of the month 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 also a new interface called 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.759
 pci express and something about 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 graphics cards 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.829
 We'll look at it from cpu 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.420
 The cover is not the talk 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.030
 Nevertheless, there was also in this area 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 something new if only for notebooks 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
 intel just had a new generation 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.600
 presented and proved the pentium m 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.200
 for professors to be fast and easy 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.360
 still be economical and cool 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 why only nobody has that department 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.470
 betrayed the pentium 4 developed 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.650
 has now as we know today was the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 p4 later collapsed its successor 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.840
 based on this one the highest 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.210
 successful pentium m on the go 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 Amd also wanted in this market 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 Intervene and offered against the pentium m 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.289
 a new mobile processor on the up 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.679
 the grandiose athlon 64 based the 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.759
 the ba also quite fast and 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.429
 quite economical 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.179
 but most of all was with amd high 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:25.740
 wireless compatibility high wireless 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.679
 Compatibility must be honest 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.899
 more jokes about doing something really 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.810
 There was only a new one in the graphics sector 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.659
 pci express the following technology for pc 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.630
 and agp alike, we considered 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.399
 a great graphics card test this 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 bild said the new pci were express 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.719
 cards were about a meter long and were 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.299
 so hot that they are only under water 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.530
 could be operated 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.649
 but that is probably only one 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.259
 moderate image montage actually were the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.600
 first pci cards not so very different 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.939
 as their ag plan only that they just 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.069
 other mainboards required and for 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.049
 this benchmark box was occupied by the 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.179
 new technology hardly faster than that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.700
 old nevertheless was clear 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.160
 Pizza Express was the new standard and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.799
 he would agp in a few years completely 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 displace long ago is displaced to 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.380
 luck also this relic of gray 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 prehistoric times 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 a so-called diskette the things 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 were terribly loud that way 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 good as never and worked so fast 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.150
 like the development team of duke nukem 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.340
 forever who bizarre more about this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 want to know storage facilities 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.250
 his grandparents or is a local 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.920
 museum 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.960
 although even then already outdated 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.940
 Did you need the diskette at that time? 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.910
 Cretaceous actually still around windows 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.720
 xp dealing with sata drives 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.760
 teach 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.880
 By the way, this is also what this is about 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.010
 Article who did not want to do that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.280
 had to pater with the sata predecessor 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.070
 live as idol known and unfortunately 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.210
 unlike the turiner not wireless 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.730
 compatible 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.630
 because the worst thing about Qatar was the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.610
 electric wire 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.320
 They were an estimated two meters wide 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.870
 blocked the airflow and left 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.960
 constantly broken like this tip here 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 showed you could the cables really 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.910
 bend for which they can bend the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.490
 is so ok disks and the expressions 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.200
 but you probably still know cables 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.650
 Remember these too 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.510
 Things here called joysticks by 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.490
 which we actually still eight 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.570
 different copies for a test 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.450
 could gather 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.010
 that would be more difficult to everything today 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.060
 There are hardly any games left with them 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.610
 let test 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.590
 At that time we were really so foolhardy 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.260
 the sticks among others with a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.200
 to test shooter namely star wars 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.030
 Battlefront 2 at least better than 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.180
 such a game with a gamepad too 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.800
 but nobody does that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.540
 voluntarily but not only we have 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.510
 at that time diligently hardware tested but 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.910
 also the readers in a laser 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.340
 Test campaign we sent you 100 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.050
 microsoft mice make you a judgment about 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.670
 their practicability falls to 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.510
 to let 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.000
 in fact they were from the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.610
 accuracy of ergonomics and the 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.130
 battery life of the wireless and thus 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.910
 apparently wireless compatible mouse right 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.850
 done 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.640
 but what confuses me, no one is human 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.109
 criticized the color what's going on with 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.810
 They are color blind to them 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.580
 Here we come to something prettier 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.680
 game of the month 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.470
 that was a clown of command and 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.330
 conquer generals looked like command 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.819
 conquer generals and played like 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.969
 command conquer generals in contrast to 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:42.389
 general, however, is different 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:46.080
 as with generals, there was okay it is 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.870
 practically the same the most exciting piece 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.060
 software of issue 3 2005, however, was 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.539
 a small web browser with the obscure 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.759
 names mozilla firefox at that time straight 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.159
 was released in version 1.0 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.080
 what at that time still as secret tip of the 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.900
 Idea is needed today 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.669
 in this country long market leader and if 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.930
 this development will continue 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.909
 in a few years in one 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.270
 similar articles maybe yes the 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.479
 internet explorer as an exotic little one 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.960
 Alternatively, imagine a browser 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:21.409
 Time will tell, that is until the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.409
 next time
