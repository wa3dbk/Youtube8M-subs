it isn't his fault, he's Irish

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.860
I don't want that you discriminate him only because he's foreign

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.960
we have to adapt to his culture

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.534

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.940
no one knows that we Irish people are plotting

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.500

00:00:57.274 --> 00:00:59.274
I can hear you, I was hearing you talking about the conquering of the world

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:00.255
I'm near to you

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:02.074

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.560
I trapped him in this bubble so he will fly away

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.254
and he will never tease you again

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.188
