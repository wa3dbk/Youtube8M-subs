going<00:01:58.560> through<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.250> circuit<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.630> how<00:02:00.780> we

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
going through the circuit this is how we

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.039 
going through the circuit this is how we
warm<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.500> bolt<00:02:02.070> after<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.210> several<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
warm up bolt after we do several of the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
warm up bolt after we do several of the
roundoff<00:02:04.500> rebounds<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> horse<00:02:05.850> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
roundoff rebounds up to the horse then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.889 
roundoff rebounds up to the horse then
we<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> timer's<00:02:07.860> over<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> barrel<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
we do the timer's over the barrel to a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
we do the timer's over the barrel to a
stand

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
stand

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.910 
stand
and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.720> you'll<00:02:12.900> notice<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.440> soon<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.770> they

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and then you'll notice as soon as they

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.010 
and then you'll notice as soon as they
come<00:02:14.160> down<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:14.670> automatically<00:02:15.420> go<00:02:15.660> right<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
come down they automatically go right to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.230 
come down they automatically go right to
the<00:02:16.110> next<00:02:16.440> station<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.550> set<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.000> as

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the next station and you can set up as

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 
the next station and you can set up as
many<00:02:18.270> stations<00:02:18.870> based<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> number<00:02:20.160> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
many stations based on the number of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.700 
many stations based on the number of
kids<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.420> make<00:02:21.660> sure<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.170> set<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
kids but make sure when you set up the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.120 
kids but make sure when you set up the
stations<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.420> athletes<00:02:24.990> know<00:02:25.290> exactly

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
stations that the athletes know exactly

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.340 
stations that the athletes know exactly
what<00:02:26.430> you're<00:02:26.610> emphasizing<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.690> why<00:02:27.960> they're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
what you're emphasizing and why they're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.130 
what you're emphasizing and why they're
doing<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.740> particular<00:02:29.610> drill<00:02:29.990> Cassie<00:02:30.990> let's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
doing that particular drill Cassie let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800 
doing that particular drill Cassie let's
do<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.500> again<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.640> notice<00:02:33.090> she<00:02:33.420> did<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
do that again if you notice she did the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.440 
do that again if you notice she did the
pike<00:02:34.080> forward<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.340> she<00:02:35.520> over<00:02:35.850> rotated

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
pike forward and then she over rotated

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.540 
pike forward and then she over rotated
because<00:02:36.720> she<00:02:36.960> whipped<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.530> really<00:02:38.160> want<00:02:38.400> them

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
because she whipped I really want them

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.060 
because she whipped I really want them
to<00:02:38.610> keep<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.060> shoulders<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:40.290> correct

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
to keep the shoulders up that's correct

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190 
to keep the shoulders up that's correct
and<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> better<00:02:42.090> shape<00:02:42.750> all

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and then there was the better shape all

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:54.290 
and then there was the better shape all
right<00:02:43.410> Amelia<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> stand<00:02:52.640> okay<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:54.060> they're

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
right Amelia to a stand okay if they're

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.080 
right Amelia to a stand okay if they're
flying<00:02:54.510> backwards<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.400> wrong

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
flying backwards like that the wrong

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
flying backwards like that the wrong
part<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.810> drill<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:59.010> she<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.370> so

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
part of that drill is that she was so

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.990 
part of that drill is that she was so
slow<00:03:00.300> coming<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:02.040> she<00:03:02.190> had<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.460> whip<00:03:02.700> off

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
slow coming on that she had to whip off

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
slow coming on that she had to whip off
what<00:03:03.720> they<00:03:03.870> want<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:04.860> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> try

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the barrel not flying backwards because

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.610 
the barrel not flying backwards because

snap under for rotation the long flat
vaults<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.280> land<00:03:38.640> on<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.970> rear<00:03:39.209> end<00:03:39.240> you'll

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
vaults that land on the rear end you'll

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.500 
vaults that land on the rear end you'll
see<00:03:39.750> hand<00:03:40.200> contact<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:41.100> late<00:03:41.459> they<00:03:42.150> come<00:03:42.360> off

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510

the horse late and then therefore

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.550 
the horse late and then therefore
there's<00:03:44.850> no<00:03:44.910> rise<00:03:45.350> okay

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560
