00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi to all it's pascal I show you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 a video in relation to 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 warm-ups you have many of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.039
 ride a bike before your 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.980
 training to warm you up and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.199
 it is unfortunately false why 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 when you ride a bike already you go 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.160
 you get tired when you do 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
 bike and you first go to pump 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.019
 the blood in the legs that means 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 this lifting europe the fact that you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.559
 do your legs like that seems to me it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 already goes down not just a bike ride 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 the polled are people's legs and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 to attack your training 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 it's perfect if you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 do like me tonight I'm doing 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.539
 pectorals 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.910
 so I have love heats but rotators 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.980
 it's the most important thing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.989
 do you warm rotators I have you 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 showed the video I put the link back 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.460
 underneath look there if you do not have it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 not seen yet is heated first 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.899
 rotators it's very very important 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.969
 it is to avoid any injury because 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 when we have developed 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.210
 lying there months of pressure you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.950
 put so much weight on rotators 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 to enveitg to exactly the same thing 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.400
 it's when you work your shoulders and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 surf your rotators agree 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 firstly and heat the engines 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 secondly what is really very 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 good for warming your chest 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.409
 before doing the bench press at 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.370
 instead of warming you up directly on 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.260
 the bench press 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.550
 I advise you to make the butterfly 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.770
 I show you that right away dac 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.290
 the patient he knows you arrival 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.520
 in all the sites if he could 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:45.720
 fellah simply you do like 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.130
 that does not make it to her at first when 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.060
 we do twenty and know 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 actually pumped all the blood into the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.160
 part of the pectorals 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.160
 which is really great for 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.720
 start after the bench press 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.750
 like that your pecs are hot 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.540
 as a bench press to dishes enormously 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.030
 weight when doing an exercise 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.930
 on the pecs the shoulders or 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.170
 any of them 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.850
 do the exercise first or will you 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 can put the maximum weight 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.110
 do not start with an exercise where you 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.550
 can make less weight 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.460
 report to the next one you're going to do 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.200
 first always do the exercise where 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.640
 you can put the maximum weight to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.530
 this you can really you it's 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.120
 still fresh you are.you are 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.900
 still very hot you are not you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 tired so first exercise for his 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 requires the most effort the most 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.550
 strength 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.350
 the so-called bedtime when you do them 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.170
 country is the first end of the effect 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.709
 home and on the timestamps done 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.350
 to insert this butterfly series of 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.209
 sale once or twice to pump the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 blood of a raid in which turns to 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.020
 very warm poet when you do the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.940
 bench press well still fights 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.100
 overexcited 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.200
 you do two warm ups again 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.150
 before starting with humor really 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.300
 very important is to avoid you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.970
 any injury in summer mobile homes 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.700

 rotators warm up your pecs and 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.550
 After you start doing the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.350
