00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.230
 now the results raise the tarragon 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.360
 there was no more information about halo 4 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.719
 we started and well then the first thing that you 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.599
 I bring a little analysis of the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.480
 trailer naturally and good for 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.100
 here today during the first part of the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.359
 trailer we know some of the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.490
 characters as you take the ones that will be 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.599
 one of the main protagonists of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.400
 this series today in general we know 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.130
 all the cadets and the academy where 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.810
 train in the second part of the video 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
 we see the first appearance of those who 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.770
 shows in this series and several scenes 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.130
 of combat 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.210
 but the most interesting thing is at the end 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.560
 where we can hear a message that I 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.280
 I taught in my first videos in the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.040
 channel two months ago or so and one 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.129
 where they cut to says the following says 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.640
 neiva mayday ahead down help 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.530
 immediate 117 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.119
 at night 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.460
 and it is that we find very interesting 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.830
 no relevant but what is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.590
 important comes after and good after 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.360
 that the message ends well is a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.909
 person asking to be helped to repeat 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.670
 the message 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 my theory is that that adult man can 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 to be the ones that have already become the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.569
 elite of the aud nzd infinite and when 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 they receive the message of help to cut 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.789
 when they are in the master boss they are in 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.060
 the way reading or drifting in the 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.310
 space 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.259
 maybe after listening to this message 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 and know that your idol because if you do not 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.310
 you know 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 You take the scj and it becomes what you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.340
 turns into this elite 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.270
 practically in the highest range of the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.150
 of the infiniti becomes that thanks 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.390
 to 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.810
 the master boss of the house he wants 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.820
 become like in some way or 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.130
 something like almonds 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.650
 it will no longer happen from knowing that you can 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.500
 your life is in trouble 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.540
 can you define to lead to the infinite 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 to the location of the flora height 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.080
 although he would be in requiem to rescue 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.560
 Cortana and in which this can be a 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.700
 little what we saw in the life action 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.819
 trailer in the demo of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.700
 in the e3 demo when we see what 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.310
 that the requiem practically the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.650
 it absorbs then they may be in that 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.110
 in that search and rescue of the boss 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.870
 destroyed we will see what happens from 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.640
 from there all we have tells us 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.459
 you extract is that the terminals 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.050
 will return to halo 4 and well still not 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.959
 knows exactly how 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.330
 they will return but it is more possible that they 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.480
 animated as halo anniversary and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.099
 that are not like textual halo 3 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.640
 I personally like the most 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.640
 animated 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.540
 as its own name indicates because it is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.900
 animated are you seeing something that moves 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.000
 something 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.270
 I do not know what you do not know about 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.600
 textual 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.150
 I do not know are profession somehow they are 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.780
 more boring I do not know how to read the other is to see 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.780
 and have more fun 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.870
 and good finally I miss what you 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.240
 I said start of my channel something that has 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.780
 filtered and good is a cinematic of the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.230
 halo campaign 4 and good is the ossla 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.610
 showed immediately subtitled 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.120
 completely to Spanish and well then 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.120
 now we go back 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.050
 4 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.140
 wow 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.000
 esther 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.240
 there are hours 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.750
 portis 9 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 nothing 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.680
 and why 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.050
 well it has been the halo kinematics 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.380
 4 and well we can see how is the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.290
 captain of the ancient river infinitive 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.690
 it is called and cut in chief and the boss 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.470
 teacher are arguing because they cut 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.750
 there the master boss need to use it 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.390
 infinity to prevent something from coming out 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.100
 requiem because if he leaves requiem 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.430
 they will endanger all humanity 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.440
 as the master boss says but andrew the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.930
 river can again repeat captain of the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.690
 infinitude 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.840
 he does not want to endanger his ship and 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.789
 wants when they 're ready that 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.930
 leave requiem I go to the station 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:17.910
 Caribbean and good then we see that as 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.720
 the master boss and cut into the skin that 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.509
 does not yield the river andrew as they cut 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.990
 it seems that they get angry 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:30.750
 alive we do not see that it should ever happen 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.639
 the blue to red color that can 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.169
 mean what is the anger the ramp 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.190
 ncoa but let's go to more 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.280
 that gets mad 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.940
 do not dry see because really 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.240
 I needed to use infinity to 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.420
 prevent something from coming out of requiem 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.420
 Well, the truth was pretty good, 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.440
 this kinematic and good the little bit and 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.630
 little we've seen from history 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.450
 in this video and well so far 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.370
 until the video arrives 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.410
 good then likes the video 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.810
 favorite if you think the video deserves it 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.440
 and suffered pep guns 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.440
 goodbye
