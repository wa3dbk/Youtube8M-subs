00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
when I'm working I realized that I had

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.089 
when I'm working I realized that I had
so<00:04:49.870> many<00:04:50.020> things<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.440> do<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.830> haven't

grin<00:04:53.680> from<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.099> end

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
grin from the end

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.160 
grin from the end
my<00:04:54.810> guts<00:04:55.050> out<00:04:55.290> great<00:04:55.950> from<00:04:56.190> my<00:04:56.340> heart<00:04:56.580> that

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
it's okay and I don't think oh if we

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.910 
it's okay and I don't think oh if we
could<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:00.750> be<00:05:00.990> five<00:05:01.200> o'clock<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.770> could

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
could just be five o'clock and I could

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.040 
could just be five o'clock and I could
be<00:05:02.010> finished<00:05:02.340> with<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:03.180> like<00:05:03.360> and

often<00:05:04.500> when<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.620> go<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.830> bed<00:05:04.980> at<00:05:05.130> night<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.580> lay<00:05:06.270> my

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
often when I go to bed at night I lay my

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.570
