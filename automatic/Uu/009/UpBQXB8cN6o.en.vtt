hey there Lenny Bruno's senior editor
for<00:00:06.550> boots<00:00:06.790> come<00:00:07.300> back<00:00:07.660> with<00:00:07.870> you<00:00:07.990> to<00:00:08.110> talk

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
for boots come back with you to talk

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.280 
for boots come back with you to talk
boots<00:00:08.639> well<00:00:09.639> you<00:00:09.730> know<00:00:09.850> last<00:00:10.240> week<00:00:10.510> we<00:00:11.050> talked

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
boots well you know last week we talked

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.170 
boots well you know last week we talked
about<00:00:11.410> some<00:00:11.710> basic<00:00:12.190> hull<00:00:12.490> design<00:00:12.880> so<00:00:13.150> I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
about some basic hull design so I

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.879 
about some basic hull design so I
thought<00:00:13.420> maybe<00:00:13.540> this<00:00:13.930> week<00:00:14.170> we<00:00:14.500> should<00:00:14.679> talk

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
thought maybe this week we should talk

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.769 
thought maybe this week we should talk
about<00:00:14.950> another<00:00:15.519> aspect<00:00:16.059> of<00:00:16.180> hull<00:00:16.330> design<00:00:16.630> it's

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
about another aspect of hull design it's

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.700 
about another aspect of hull design it's
often<00:00:17.290> misunderstood<00:00:18.150> steps<00:00:19.199> now<00:00:20.199> a<00:00:20.230> boat<00:00:20.529> can

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
often misunderstood steps now a boat can

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.529 
often misunderstood steps now a boat can
have<00:00:20.860> one<00:00:21.130> step<00:00:21.400> in<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:21.640> holler<00:00:21.820> maybe<00:00:22.180> two

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
have one step in the holler maybe two

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.349 
have one step in the holler maybe two
you<00:00:23.260> can<00:00:23.440> see<00:00:23.470> here<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:23.980> this<00:00:24.100> formula<00:00:24.490> 370

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
you can see here on this formula 370

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.230 
you can see here on this formula 370
sport<00:00:25.720> it's<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.350> double<00:00:26.800> stepped<00:00:27.130> hull<00:00:27.460> but

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
sport it's a double stepped hull but

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.529 
sport it's a double stepped hull but
what<00:00:28.660> exactly<00:00:29.170> do<00:00:29.289> these<00:00:29.439> steps<00:00:29.710> do<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.300> whole

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
what exactly do these steps do the whole

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.930 
what exactly do these steps do the whole
idea<00:00:32.169> behind<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.769> concept<00:00:33.400> of<00:00:33.550> putting<00:00:33.850> a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
idea behind the concept of putting a

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.060 
idea behind the concept of putting a
step<00:00:34.360> in<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.720> hull<00:00:34.870> of<00:00:34.900> a<00:00:35.080> boat<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.920> get

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
step in the hull of a boat is to get

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.369 
step in the hull of a boat is to get
some<00:00:36.339> of<00:00:36.460> that<00:00:36.489> hull<00:00:36.790> out<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> water<00:00:37.720> less

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
some of that hull out of the water less

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.920 
some of that hull out of the water less
all<00:00:38.589> in<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.800> water<00:00:38.979> means<00:00:39.339> less<00:00:39.640> drag<00:00:39.970> now

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
all in the water means less drag now

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.469 
all in the water means less drag now
let's<00:00:41.350> take<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> close-up<00:00:42.040> look<00:00:42.280> at<00:00:42.549> the<00:00:43.150> steps

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
let's take a close-up look at the steps

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.149 
let's take a close-up look at the steps
in<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.780> formula<00:00:44.379> oh<00:00:44.879> hey<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.739> can<00:00:47.949> see

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
in that formula oh hey well you can see

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.189 
in that formula oh hey well you can see
the<00:00:48.309> notch<00:00:48.549> in<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.089> hull<00:00:49.269> side<00:00:49.540> that's

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
the notch in the hull side that's

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.689 
the notch in the hull side that's
commonly<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.949> first<00:00:51.220> thing<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.460> people

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
commonly the first thing that people

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.990 
commonly the first thing that people
notice<00:00:52.000> about<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.750> step<00:00:53.110> now<00:00:54.070> if<00:00:54.369> we<00:00:54.760> look<00:00:54.879> a

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
notice about a step now if we look a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.930 
notice about a step now if we look a
little<00:00:55.150> closer<00:00:55.449> you<00:00:55.930> can<00:00:56.110> see<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.940> forward

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
little closer you can see that forward

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.910 
little closer you can see that forward
of<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.089> notch<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:59.199> hull<00:00:59.350> is<00:00:59.470> at<00:00:59.559> one<00:00:59.739> level

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
of that notch the hull is at one level

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.100 
of that notch the hull is at one level
and<00:01:00.190> aft<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:01.119> at<00:01:01.299> a<00:01:01.360> slightly<00:01:01.720> higher

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
and aft of it it's at a slightly higher

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.490 
and aft of it it's at a slightly higher
level<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.760> what<00:01:04.299> exactly<00:01:04.390> does<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.140> do<00:01:05.290> for

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
level so what exactly does that do for

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.910 
level so what exactly does that do for
you<00:01:05.590> well<00:01:06.509> let's<00:01:07.509> use<00:01:07.719> this<00:01:07.899> fine<00:01:08.380> new<00:01:08.649> boat<00:01:08.890> I

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
you well let's use this fine new boat I

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.179 
you well let's use this fine new boat I
have<00:01:09.219> here<00:01:09.490> as<00:01:09.640> an<00:01:10.149> example<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.710> see<00:01:11.890> it's

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
have here as an example you can see it's

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
have here as an example you can see it's
a<00:01:12.219> simple<00:01:12.399> hull<00:01:12.759> no<00:01:13.210> step<00:01:13.539> let's<00:01:14.409> have<00:01:14.649> one

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a simple hull no step let's have one

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.630 
a simple hull no step let's have one
I'll<00:01:17.560> just<00:01:17.619> give<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.250> little<00:01:18.369> notch<00:01:18.609> right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
I'll just give it a little notch right

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.560 
I'll just give it a little notch right
there<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.890> my<00:01:21.039> step<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.729> bottom<00:01:22.149> and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
there there's my step in the bottom and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.230 
there there's my step in the bottom and
my<00:01:22.810> notch<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.500> other<00:01:23.619> side<00:01:23.890> like<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.929> now

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
my notch on the other side like so now

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.999 
my notch on the other side like so now
remember<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.750> creates<00:01:29.079> some<00:01:29.320> low-pressure

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
remember it creates some low-pressure

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.840 
remember it creates some low-pressure
area<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:32.079> in<00:01:32.109> here<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.890> air<00:01:33.189> gets<00:01:33.490> sucked

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
area right in here so air gets sucked

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.149 
area right in here so air gets sucked
into<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.359> notches<00:01:34.780> on<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.929> side<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
into the notches on the side like so and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
into the notches on the side like so and
tends<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.340> create<00:01:39.609> an<00:01:39.960> area<00:01:41.999> about<00:01:42.999> like<00:01:43.420> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
tends to create an area about like that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.639 
tends to create an area about like that
with<00:01:44.770> nothing<00:01:45.310> but<00:01:45.429> air<00:01:45.640> underneath<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.149> hull

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
with nothing but air underneath the hull

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.700 
with nothing but air underneath the hull
now<00:01:47.649> of<00:01:47.799> course<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:49.030> here<00:01:49.479> we<00:01:50.409> still<00:01:50.649> have

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
now of course back here we still have

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.219 
now of course back here we still have
water<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.399> drag<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.659> all<00:01:52.749> the<00:01:52.899> usual

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
water and drag and all the usual

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.260 
water and drag and all the usual
problems<00:01:53.679> associated<00:01:54.009> with<00:01:54.490> moving<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.880> solid

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
problems associated with moving a solid

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.749 
problems associated with moving a solid
object<00:01:55.420> through<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.319> water<00:01:56.499> but<00:01:57.189> by<00:01:57.700> getting

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
object through the water but by getting

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.370 
object through the water but by getting
this<00:01:58.149> little<00:01:58.450> piece<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.899> bed<00:01:59.079> right<00:01:59.259> here

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
this little piece of the bed right here

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.559 
this little piece of the bed right here
out<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.799> water<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.549> can<00:02:00.700> often<00:02:01.149> gain<00:02:01.359> as

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
out of the water you can often gain as

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.809 
out of the water you can often gain as
much<00:02:01.840> as<00:02:02.020> 10<00:02:02.289> or<00:02:02.560> even<00:02:02.590> 15<00:02:02.950> percent<00:02:03.639> in

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
much as 10 or even 15 percent in
