G's five row Cordy keyboard so the nice
thing<00:02:12.879> about<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.749> has<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> row<00:02:14.590> for

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
thing about it is that it has a row for

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.349 
thing about it is that it has a row for
numbers<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.189> dedicated<00:02:15.670> row<00:02:15.969> so<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.239> don't
