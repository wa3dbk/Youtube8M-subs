are many other signatures and in this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
are many other signatures and in this
session<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.719> gonna<00:00:15.780> focus<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.410> six<00:00:16.800> eight

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
session we're gonna focus on six eight

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
session we're gonna focus on six eight
and<00:00:17.190> twelve<00:00:17.789> eighth<00:00:17.970> time<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:19.020> play<00:00:19.260> them

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and twelve eighth time you play them

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.859 
and twelve eighth time you play them
both<00:00:19.890> pretty<00:00:20.189> much<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> same<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.630> six

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
both pretty much the same way so six

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.779 
both pretty much the same way so six
eight<00:00:22.050> means<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.949> six<00:00:23.250> beats<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
eight means there's six beats in a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.120 
eight means there's six beats in a
measure<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.900> eighth<00:00:25.109> note<00:00:25.439> gets<00:00:25.859> one

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
measure and the eighth note gets one

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
measure and the eighth note gets one
beat<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> swing<00:00:29.300> one<00:00:30.300> two

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
beat so it's more like a swing one two
