00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
will bring up bring up the camera you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
will bring up bring up the camera you
can't<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.430> because

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can't really see it right now because

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.560 
can't really see it right now because
it's<00:02:00.290> sitting<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.350> my<00:02:01.500> desk<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.570> basically

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's sitting on my desk but basically

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.310 
it's sitting on my desk but basically
you<00:02:03.780> would<00:02:03.960> point<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> sky<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you would point this at the sky and that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139 
you would point this at the sky and that
will<00:02:07.530> show<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.340> different<00:02:08.729> satellites

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
will show you some different satellites

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
will show you some different satellites
on<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.569> screen<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.649> could<00:02:10.800> point<00:02:11.069> your

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
on the screen and you could point your

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.490 
on the screen and you could point your
device<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.849> locate<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.930> way

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.450 

unfortunately<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> can't<00:02:16.830> show<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.430> on

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
unfortunately I can't show it to you on

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.060 
unfortunately I can't show it to you on
camera<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.600> does<00:02:18.840> work<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.500> tested<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
camera but it does work I have tested it

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.920 
camera but it does work I have tested it
by<00:02:21.000> myself<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.380> actually<00:02:22.830> very<00:02:23.040> cool

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
by myself and it's actually very cool

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.690 
by myself and it's actually very cool
and<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.290> could<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.590> ahead<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.860> jump<00:02:26.340> into<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and you could go ahead and jump into the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
and you could go ahead and jump into the
different<00:02:27.060> settings<00:02:27.300> where<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.080> could<00:02:28.410> set

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
different settings where you could set

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.970 
different settings where you could set
manual<00:02:29.640> coordinates<00:02:30.090> for<00:02:30.270> your<00:02:30.300> GPS<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
manual coordinates for your GPS and a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.770 
manual coordinates for your GPS and a
variety<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.430> other<00:02:32.730> options<00:02:32.970> including

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
variety of other options including

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.020 
variety of other options including
review<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.350> application<00:02:34.980> support<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
review the application support it and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.010 
review the application support it and
the<00:02:36.320> Update<00:02:37.320> button

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.120 

as<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.740> can<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.550> very<00:02:45.850> long<00:02:46.150> list<00:02:46.510> of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
as you can see it's a very long list of

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.490 
as you can see it's a very long list of
satellites<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.460> it's<00:02:49.000> very<00:02:49.720> well<00:02:50.200> populated

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
satellites and it's very well populated

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.710 
satellites and it's very well populated
so<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:51.520> don't<00:02:51.970> think<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.360> will<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.660> any

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
so I don't think you will have any

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.350 
so I don't think you will have any
issues<00:02:53.530> locating<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.310> satellites<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.090> you

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
issues locating the satellites that you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.260 
issues locating the satellites that you
need<00:02:55.660> with<00:02:56.410> tons<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.800> information<00:02:57.270> this

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
need with tons of information this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.600 
need with tons of information this
application<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.530> cool<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.160> will<00:03:00.400> show

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
you the direction of the satellite on

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.330 
you the direction of the satellite on
the<00:03:03.550> map<00:03:04.090> or<00:03:04.390> sorry<00:03:04.900> rather<00:03:05.290> your<00:03:05.770> camera<00:03:06.220> as

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
as you can see moving the device changes

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.160 
as you can see moving the device changes
that<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.490> is<00:03:12.700> very<00:03:12.970> cool<00:03:13.240> as<00:03:13.480> well<00:03:13.510> so

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
there you go this is satellite or set

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.860 
there you go this is satellite or set
finder<00:03:17.050> Pro<00:03:17.380> rather<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.640> iPhone<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:19.660> ahead

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
finder Pro rather for iPhone go ahead

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.000 
finder Pro rather for iPhone go ahead
and<00:03:20.110> check<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> out<00:03:20.710> on<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.520> App<00:03:21.700> side
