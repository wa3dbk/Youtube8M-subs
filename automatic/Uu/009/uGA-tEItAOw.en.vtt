and actually I remember debuted on a
super<00:01:08.369> bowl<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> didn't<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.689> do

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
super bowl and then it didn't really do

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
super bowl and then it didn't really do
well<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.670> year<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.270> or

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
well like for the first year or so or

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
well like for the first year or so or
whatever<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.680> Fox<00:01:14.280> cancelled<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
whatever it was and so Fox cancelled the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.810 
whatever it was and so Fox cancelled the
show<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:16.380> once<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.040> released<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> DVD

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
show and then once it released the DVD

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
show and then once it released the DVD
it<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.210> gained<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> huge<00:01:18.840> cult<00:01:19.110> following

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it just gained this huge cult following

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
it just gained this huge cult following
I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.979> wasn't<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.310> 97<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.000> stuff<00:01:21.119> like

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
I think it wasn't like 97 or stuff like

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
I think it wasn't like 97 or stuff like
that<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> honestly<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.500> was

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that I honestly don't know it was

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
that I honestly don't know it was
definitely<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.950> while<00:01:23.070> ago<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.880> gained<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
definitely a while ago they gained this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
definitely a while ago they gained this
huge<00:01:24.780> cult<00:01:25.080> following<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.830> they

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
huge cult following and then they

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.670 
huge cult following and then they
actually<00:01:26.250> brought<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.930> show<00:01:28.080> back<00:01:28.290> to
