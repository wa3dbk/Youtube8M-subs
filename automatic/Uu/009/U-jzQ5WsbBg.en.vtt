year<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> mean<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.800> think<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.280> happens<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
year I mean I think that happens you

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
year I mean I think that happens you
know<00:01:59.940> with<00:02:00.090> different<00:02:00.600> teams<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.320> time

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
know with different teams all the time

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160 
know with different teams all the time
and<00:02:01.800> but<00:02:02.330> obviously<00:02:03.330> i<00:02:03.420> mean<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.720> it's<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> big

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and but obviously i mean it's it's a big

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.580 
and but obviously i mean it's it's a big
two<00:02:04.350> points<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.440> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
two points and and you know we want to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.109 
two points and and you know we want to
try<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.860> catch<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.039> obviously<00:02:08.310> still<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
try and catch me obviously still and and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.090 
try and catch me obviously still and and
so<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> makes

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so if we want to do that then that makes

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.820 
so if we want to do that then that makes
the<00:02:11.250> native<00:02:11.550> pretty<00:02:11.700> big
