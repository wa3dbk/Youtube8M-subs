00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.930 

as<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:55.030> see<00:05:55.210> plenty<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:56.140> damage<00:05:56.940> but

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
as you see plenty of damage but

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.030 
as you see plenty of damage but
obviously<00:05:58.270> when<00:05:58.570> use<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.750> mascara<00:05:59.140> we<00:05:59.800> want<00:05:59.980> to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
obviously when use a mascara we want to

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.810 
obviously when use a mascara we want to
clip<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.370> with<00:06:00.640> menace<00:06:01.620> but<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:02.950> don't<00:06:03.460> use<00:06:03.670> it

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
clip it with menace but I don't use it

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.580 
clip it with menace but I don't use it
because<00:06:03.850> it<00:06:04.600> was<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.840> bit<00:06:05.050> spine<00:06:05.260> tuck<00:06:05.440> run

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590
