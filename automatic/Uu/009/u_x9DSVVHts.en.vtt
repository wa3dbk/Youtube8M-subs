00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

you<00:00:00.240> guys<00:00:00.359> used<00:00:00.659> an<00:00:00.810> analogy<00:00:01.079> or<00:00:01.890> Ghassan

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
you guys used an analogy or Ghassan

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.440 
you guys used an analogy or Ghassan
metaphor<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:04.670> not<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:05.819> much<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.089> courtship

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
metaphor for not so much the courtship

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.000 
metaphor for not so much the courtship
process<00:00:06.600> but<00:00:07.049> your<00:00:07.140> interactions<00:00:07.710> with<00:00:07.770> women

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
process but your interactions with women

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.919 
process but your interactions with women
and<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.309> equated<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.880> being<00:00:09.389> similar<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and you equated it to being similar to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.440 
and you equated it to being similar to
dance<00:00:10.429> yeah<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.910> could<00:00:12.000> elaborate<00:00:12.300> on

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
dance yeah if you could elaborate on

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.299 
dance yeah if you could elaborate on
that<00:00:12.480> because<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:13.019> think<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.980> me<00:00:14.160> at

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
that because I think that for me at

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
that because I think that for me at
least<00:00:14.340> being<00:00:15.059> aware<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> message<00:00:15.570> it

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
least being aware of the message it

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
least being aware of the message it
really<00:00:16.170> sort<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> characterized<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.340> give

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
really sort of characterized in and give

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.510 
really sort of characterized in and give
it<00:00:17.550> sort<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.880> new<00:00:18.000> feel<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.310> again<00:00:20.310> its

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it sort of a new feel and again its

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
it sort of a new feel and again its
simplicity<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> lot<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
simplicity but I think that a lot of the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890 
simplicity but I think that a lot of the
audience<00:00:22.800> might<00:00:23.189> take<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.910> away<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.210> be

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
audience might take that away and be

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.029 
audience might take that away and be
able<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> sort<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> character<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> their

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
able to sort of character out in their

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
able to sort of character out in their
own<00:00:26.070> ways<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.210> elaborate<00:00:27.599> yeah<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
own ways if you want to elaborate yeah I

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.759 
own ways if you want to elaborate yeah I
think<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> dance<00:00:29.880> metaphor<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
think that the dance metaphor is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
think that the dance metaphor is
profound<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:32.460> Toronto<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.239> guys

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
profound in Toronto here you guys

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
profound in Toronto here you guys
there's<00:00:33.840> there's<00:00:34.110> guys<00:00:34.320> who<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.649> teaching

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
there's there's guys who are teaching

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790 
there's there's guys who are teaching
trying<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.579> teach<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.630> concept<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.680> way

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
trying to teach the concept of the way

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.530 
trying to teach the concept of the way
men<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> women<00:00:38.790> communicate<00:00:38.969> stuff

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
men and women communicate stuff

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
men and women communicate stuff
communicate<00:00:40.020> connect<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.940> dance<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.800> I<00:00:43.800> think

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
communicate connect to dance and I think

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
communicate connect to dance and I think
it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> fantastic<00:00:45.539> thing<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.289> man

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's a fantastic thing I think if a man

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.670 
it's a fantastic thing I think if a man
wants<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> understand<00:00:47.690> women<00:00:48.690> he<00:00:49.350> should<00:00:49.559> take

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
wants to understand women he should take

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.610 
wants to understand women he should take
up<00:00:49.829> dance<00:00:50.010> lessons<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> like

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
there's no no possibility of that kind
of<00:01:50.399> thing<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.060> hand<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.009> extension

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of thing it's just a hand in extension

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
of thing it's just a hand in extension
and<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.790> accepted<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> men<00:01:54.659> subtly

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and if it's accepted then the men subtly

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
and if it's accepted then the men subtly
but<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.700> firmly<00:01:57.090> lead<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.430> men<00:01:59.610> are

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
but but firmly lead and the men are

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.370 
but but firmly lead and the men are
leading<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> their<00:02:00.869> hands<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.170> high

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
leading and their hands are high

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.289 
leading and their hands are high
confident<00:02:02.009> high<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.000> women

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
confident high like this and the women

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
confident high like this and the women
eyes<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.600> closed<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.140> they're<00:02:04.710> feeling<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
eyes are closed and they're feeling it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.089 
eyes are closed and they're feeling it
and<00:02:05.369> they're<00:02:05.729> moving<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.210> complete

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
and they're moving in complete

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.930 
and they're moving in complete
synchronization<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> could<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.819> about

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
synchronization I could go on about

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.720 
synchronization I could go on about
because<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.539> beautiful
