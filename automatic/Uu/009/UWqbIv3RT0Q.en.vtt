00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.270 
but nursin that's my home page and see
it's<00:02:20.870> still<00:02:21.049> showing<00:02:21.349> no<00:02:21.650> signal<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.159> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
it's still showing no signal in the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520 
it's still showing no signal in the
graphic<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.689> seems<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> be<00:02:24.139> loading<00:02:24.439> up

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
graphic but it seems to be loading up

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.729 
graphic but it seems to be loading up
the<00:02:24.680> page<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:26.109> as<00:02:27.109> quickly<00:02:27.319> as<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.530> would

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the page just as quickly as it would

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:37.659 
the page just as quickly as it would
normally<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.730> there<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.620> as<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.829> say<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.280> been

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:37.669 
normally so there and as I say it's been

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.129 
normally so there and as I say it's been
really<00:02:37.819> difficult<00:02:37.909> for<00:02:38.299> me<00:02:38.419> to<00:02:38.599> try<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:38.930> get

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
really difficult for me to try and get

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.770 
really difficult for me to try and get
this<00:02:39.579> in<00:02:40.579> see<00:02:40.819> it's<00:02:40.969> still<00:02:41.120> showing<00:02:41.329> no<00:02:41.599> bars

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
this in see it's still showing no bars

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500 
this in see it's still showing no bars
bearing<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.409> Wi-Fi<00:02:42.799> graphic<00:02:43.669> but<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.389> has

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
bearing the Wi-Fi graphic but it has

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.879 
bearing the Wi-Fi graphic but it has
been<00:02:44.659> actually<00:02:44.810> really<00:02:45.169> difficult<00:02:45.290> for<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.709> to

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
been actually really difficult for me to

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.670 
been actually really difficult for me to
even<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.459> show<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.969> again<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.719> and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
even get it to show that again and and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.750 
even get it to show that again and and
it<00:02:48.889> doesn't<00:02:49.129> seem<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.400> affect<00:02:49.519> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
it doesn't seem to affect the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.080 
it doesn't seem to affect the
performance<00:02:49.909> at<00:02:50.449> all<00:02:50.689> let's<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.199> try

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
performance at all let's just try

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.039 
performance at all let's just try
looking<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.180> another<00:02:53.359> page<00:02:53.659> I've<00:02:53.930> been

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
looking at another page I've been

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.199 
looking at another page I've been
looking<00:02:54.290> at<00:02:54.379> things<00:02:54.560> like<00:02:54.849> engadget<00:02:55.849> in

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
looking at things like engadget in

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.659 
looking at things like engadget in
pocket<00:02:56.659> now<00:02:56.949> sites<00:02:57.949> which<00:02:58.219> have<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.430> lot<00:02:58.639> of

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
pocket now sites which have a lot of

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.300 
pocket now sites which have a lot of
graphics<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.659> I'm<00:03:00.439> going<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.680> need<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:00.859> you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
graphics on so I'm going to need a you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.179 
graphics on so I'm going to need a you
know<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> lot<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.349> decent<00:03:03.349> signal<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.829> load<00:03:04.010> up

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
know a lot of a decent signal to load up

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.459 
know a lot of a decent signal to load up
basically<00:03:04.609> so<00:03:05.180> try<00:03:05.569> again<00:03:05.900> let's<00:03:06.049> have<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> look

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:06.469 
basically so try again let's have a look

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:20.450 
basically so try again let's have a look
at<00:03:07.599> search<00:03:08.599> for<00:03:12.129> engadget

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.900 

choke<00:03:21.460> on<00:03:21.730> fruit<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.240> search<00:03:22.420> page<00:03:22.720> nerve

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
choke on fruit and search page nerve

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:34.540 
choke on fruit and search page nerve
left<00:03:24.910> click<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.390> actual<00:03:25.630> site

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.220 

so<00:03:35.210> even<00:03:35.420> though<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.630> shown<00:03:35.870> as<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.110> there's

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
so even though that shown as if there's

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.350 
so even though that shown as if there's
no<00:03:36.380> Wi-Fi<00:03:36.560> signal<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.670> loading<00:03:37.970> up<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.150> page

nice and fast whole thing's wear

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.830 
nice and fast whole thing's wear
something<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.060> seemed<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.270> perform<00:03:44.660> just

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
something that seemed to perform just

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.590 
something that seemed to perform just
about<00:03:45.050> as<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.410> would<00:03:45.920> expect<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.760> if<00:03:47.330> it

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
about as you would expect it to if it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.820 
about as you would expect it to if it
had<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> whole<00:03:48.020> Wi-Fi<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:51.350> yet<00:03:51.530> we've<00:03:51.620> still

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
had the whole Wi-Fi and yet we've still

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.420 
had the whole Wi-Fi and yet we've still
got<00:03:52.010> no<00:03:52.190> signal<00:03:52.400> shine<00:03:52.790> their<00:03:54.190> sub<00:03:55.190> perhaps

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
got no signal shine their sub perhaps

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.520 
got no signal shine their sub perhaps
it's<00:03:55.610> more<00:03:55.880> than<00:03:56.390> issued<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.760> the

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
it's more than issued to do with the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's more than issued to do with the
display<00:04:00.530> indicators<00:04:01.100> for<00:04:01.220> various<00:04:01.550> signals

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
display indicators for various signals

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.490 
display indicators for various signals
rather<00:04:02.150> than<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.480> actual<00:04:02.600> signal<00:04:03.140> drop<00:04:03.320> our

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
out there with people running kind of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.980 
out there with people running kind of

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
programs VIP show on a meter the signal

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.750 
programs VIP show on a meter the signal
but<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:12.950> course<00:04:13.190> when<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.060> click<00:04:14.270> on<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.450> side

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
but of course when you click on a side

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.130 
but of course when you click on a side
that<00:04:16.760> signals<00:04:17.180> going<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.420> be<00:04:17.480> boosted<00:04:17.900> its

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
that signals going to be boosted its

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.890 
that signals going to be boosted its
just<00:04:18.440> idle<00:04:18.980> otherwise<00:04:19.670> when<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.570> click<00:04:20.720> on<00:04:20.840> a

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
just idle otherwise when you click on a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.040 
just idle otherwise when you click on a
site<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.290> try<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.530> actually<00:04:21.769> use<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.720> Wi-Fi

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
site you try to actually use the Wi-Fi

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.250 
site you try to actually use the Wi-Fi
signal<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:25.310> load<00:04:25.910> up<00:04:26.180> something<00:04:27.850> then<00:04:29.020> my<00:04:30.020> bet

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
signal to load up something then my bet

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.960 
signal to load up something then my bet
is<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:31.100> needles<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:31.580> those<00:04:31.730> meters

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
is that the needles on those meters

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.090 
is that the needles on those meters
would<00:04:32.360> would<00:04:33.260> have<00:04:33.350> peaked<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.740> gone<00:04:33.920> high

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
would would have peaked and gone high

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.290 
would would have peaked and gone high
again<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:36.080> basically<00:04:36.820> if<00:04:37.820> there<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.390> an<00:04:39.290> HTC

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
again so basically if there is an HTC

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.780 
again so basically if there is an HTC
Sensation<00:04:41.300> death<00:04:41.600> grip<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.080> view<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.790> think

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
Sensation death grip this view I think

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.310 
Sensation death grip this view I think
it's<00:04:44.000> some<00:04:44.360> little<00:04:44.570> bug<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.930> Android

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's some little bug in Android

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.400 
it's some little bug in Android
somewhere<00:04:45.770> which<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:47.120> making<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.660> not<00:04:47.930> display

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
somewhere which is making it not display

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.409 
somewhere which is making it not display
the<00:04:48.470> indicators<00:04:49.100> properly<00:04:49.520> now<00:04:50.150> this<00:04:50.270> is

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
the indicators properly now this is
