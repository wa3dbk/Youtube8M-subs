first<00:00:50.800> let's<00:00:51.070> let<00:00:51.489> me<00:00:51.579> show<00:00:51.760> you<00:00:51.820> how<00:00:52.030> we're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
first let's let me show you how we're

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.450 
first let's let me show you how we're
going<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.629> measure<00:00:52.870> for<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.320> inside<00:00:53.770> now<00:00:54.010> we've

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
going to measure for it inside now we've

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to measure for it inside now we've
measured<00:00:54.700> our<00:00:54.969> mounting<00:00:55.360> depth<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.870> we've

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
measured our mounting depth and we've

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.080 
measured our mounting depth and we've
determined<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.739> we<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.250> at<00:00:57.550> least<00:00:57.730> three

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.930 
determined that we have at least three
inches<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:58.719> case<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.920> we've<00:01:00.399> decided<00:01:00.550> to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
inches in this case so we've decided to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.670 
inches in this case so we've decided to
mount<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.390> vertical<00:01:01.780> blind<00:01:02.020> inside<00:01:02.500> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
Burke lines get measured a little bit

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.650 
Burke lines get measured a little bit
differently<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.670> our<00:02:07.790> other<00:02:07.940> products<00:02:08.510> so

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
differently than our other products so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.030 
differently than our other products so
it's<00:02:08.810> important<00:02:09.260> to<00:02:09.320> note<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.560> these

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
it's important to note that these

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.710 
it's important to note that these
measurements<00:02:10.610> are<00:02:10.700> specifically<00:02:11.360> for

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
inches to that measure now here we have

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.620 
inches to that measure now here we have
42<00:02:42.020> inches<00:02:42.560> i'm<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.820> add<00:02:43.940> 6<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.480> that

that's<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.510> give<00:02:47.540> us<00:02:47.750> an<00:02:47.930> overlap<00:02:48.410> of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
that's going to give us an overlap of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.580 
that's going to give us an overlap of
three<00:02:48.950> inches<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.430> each<00:02:49.610> side<00:02:50.020> now<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.380> this

three inches on each side now in this

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.590 
three inches on each side now in this
particular<00:02:51.890> case<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.480> work

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
particular case it's not going to work

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.810 
particular case it's not going to work
out<00:02:53.900> because<00:02:54.140> we<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.590> fireplace<00:02:54.980> mantel

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
out because we have a fireplace mantel

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.590 
out because we have a fireplace mantel
in<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.810> wet<00:02:57.020> okay<00:02:57.830> if<00:02:58.580> we<00:02:58.760> didn't<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
in the wet okay if we didn't have the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.090 
in the wet okay if we didn't have the
fireplace<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.320> there<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.650> when<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.890> three

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
fireplace in there for when the three

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.180 
fireplace in there for when the three
inches<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.580> each<00:03:01.730> side<00:03:01.760> would<00:03:02.240> be<00:03:02.270> just<00:03:02.720> right

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
inches on each side would be just right

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.640 
inches on each side would be just right
however<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.580> case<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.900> don't<00:03:06.020> have<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
however in this case we don't have the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.770 
however in this case we don't have the
option<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.520> go<00:03:07.790> through<00:03:08.090> each<00:03:08.240> is<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.600> left

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
option to go through each is on the left

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.890 
option to go through each is on the left
side<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.980> we're<00:03:10.400> going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.790> go<00:03:10.820> as<00:03:11.060> far<00:03:11.390> left<00:03:11.660> as

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
side so we're going to go as far left as

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.840 
side so we're going to go as far left as
we<00:03:12.080> possibly<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.860> go<00:03:13.040> with<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.400> tape<00:03:13.610> measure

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
we possibly can go with the tape measure

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.820 
we possibly can go with the tape measure
and<00:03:14.180> we're<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.230> bring<00:03:15.410> our<00:03:15.530> tape

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
and we're going to bring our tape

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.910 
and we're going to bring our tape
measure<00:03:16.070> over<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.030> right<00:03:17.590> three<00:03:18.590> inches

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
measure over on the right three inches

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.520 
measure over on the right three inches
past<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.610> window<00:03:19.970> casing<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:21.380> this

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
past the window casing so in this

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.290 
past the window casing so in this
particular<00:03:21.739> case<00:03:22.400> we're<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.090> get<00:03:23.239> a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
particular case we're going to get a

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.260 
particular case we're going to get a
measurement<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.810> 46<00:03:24.560> inches<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.100> width<00:03:25.310> again

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
measurement of 46 inches in width again

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.880 
measurement of 46 inches in width again
this<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.630> little<00:03:26.930> bit<00:03:27.110> different<00:03:27.530> than<00:03:27.770> the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
this is a little bit different than the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.010 
this is a little bit different than the
ordinary<00:03:28.070> window<00:03:28.790> frame<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.630> will<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
ordinary window frame but you will you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020 
ordinary window frame but you will you
may<00:03:30.140> run<00:03:30.350> into<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.680> situation<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.000> I

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
may run into a situation like this so I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.010 
may run into a situation like this so I
thought<00:03:32.300> it'd<00:03:32.420> be

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
thought it'd be

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.510 
thought it'd be
that<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.500> know<00:03:33.680> how<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.950> measure<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.370> this

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
that you know how to measure in this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.360 
that you know how to measure in this
particular<00:03:34.730> case<00:03:35.800> now<00:03:36.800> that<00:03:36.830> we<00:03:37.130> have<00:03:37.160> our

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
particular case now that we have our

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.300 
particular case now that we have our
width<00:03:37.820> measurement<00:03:38.710> we<00:03:39.710> would<00:03:39.860> like<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.160> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
width measurement we would like you to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.550 
width measurement we would like you to
provide<00:03:40.460> us<00:03:40.730> with<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.940> height<00:03:41.180> measure<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
provide us with the height measure the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.050 
provide us with the height measure the
height<00:03:42.740> measurement<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.370> typically<00:03:43.820> taken

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
height measurement is typically taken

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.350 
height measurement is typically taken
from<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> top<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.960> window<00:03:45.200> trim<00:03:45.970> down<00:03:46.970> to

where you like the blinds to hang now

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.050 
where you like the blinds to hang now
some<00:03:50.150> folks<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.950> blinds<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.460> stop<00:03:52.730> at
