00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I've never put this together before so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.120 
I've never put this together before so
just<00:01:26.640> look<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:27.630> comes<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.840> kippah<00:01:28.229> all

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399 
just look it even comes with kippah all
right<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> handle<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.170> think

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
right so this is the handle and I think

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
right so this is the handle and I think
at<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> end<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.369> handle<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.909> an

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
at the end of this handle there's an

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.249 
at the end of this handle there's an
extension<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> our<00:01:33.840> windows<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> are

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
extension for our windows that are

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.280 
extension for our windows that are
really<00:01:34.530> high<00:01:35.630> another<00:01:36.630> good<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.140> might

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
really high another good thing you might

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.539 
really high another good thing you might
not<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:37.890> ladder<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.490> the
