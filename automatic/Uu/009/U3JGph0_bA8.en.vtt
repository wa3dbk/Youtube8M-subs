00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.050
 I do not doubt it 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.870
 all 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.319
 good morning to everyone to explain a little how is he 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 the counter attack 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 is a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.449
 by car with a tubular chassis on a lamborghini engine 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.390
 v10 percent 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.530
 with mat would be serious in 140 but the federation while being 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.680
 restricted to approximately 4 30 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.150
 the car then how can you invest in a very aggressive line still adds 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.030
 prototype of wishing 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 and well, a 2005 car by car that we hope will be quite 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.970
 competitive 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.160
 especially in fast track is faster the more actions in which 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.560
 was 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.730
 decently 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.920
 for this type of careers like that of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.830
 for this weekend or we do not think it's going well but you never know 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.000
 you have to work hard and well 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.480
 in the set-up of pensions mainly to tie it up makes 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.149
 Montana 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.940
 because one lives in his very hard thesis 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 a very rigid chelsea and that you have to work a little bit for this is your 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.460
 presence have these clues 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.870
 and as for the March in a room 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 it does not sound big enough and before equity they are 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.500
 instead of burning count from the car is very well worked heroin 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.910
 richly 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.980
 percent and above all for circuits tested for mountaineers and neither 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.630
 neither is it very primary 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.920
 the copi is a pretty small area 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.490
 bullet 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.540
 a boston security deposit of thought 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.880
 and it's a fairly simple car when it comes to driving 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.640
 well the most complicated percent back infiltration 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.549
 the story quite radical like all cars in this style 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.170
 but we hope we can continue to dominate it little by little 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.380
 he is the attractiveness of it then textile when putting it 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.500
 the town controls triumph of the will take them from from the positions 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.839
 away from the first positions until they 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.709
 little by little in style we are getting to impose 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 this car in the posts above 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 I do not doubt it 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.010
 all
