00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.949 
very well with Kinect as well so one of
the<00:01:46.700> major<00:01:46.880> things<00:01:47.239> I've<00:01:47.509> gained<00:01:47.780> from

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
the major things I've gained from

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.449 
the major things I've gained from
working<00:01:48.319> on<00:01:48.440> virtua<00:01:48.739> tennis<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.160> over<00:01:49.399> a

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
working on virtua tennis for over a

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.460 
working on virtua tennis for over a
decade<00:01:49.610> now<00:01:49.849> starts<00:01:50.690> off<00:01:50.780> from<00:01:50.959> the<00:01:51.080> concerns

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
decade now starts off from the concerns

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.889 
decade now starts off from the concerns
from<00:01:51.619> making<00:01:51.979> Virtua<00:01:52.340> Tennis<00:01:52.399> one<00:01:52.910> at<00:01:53.149> that

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
from making Virtua Tennis one at that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.630 
from making Virtua Tennis one at that
time<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:54.289> wondered<00:01:54.619> how<00:01:54.770> much<00:01:54.950> more<00:01:55.220> we<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:55.459> do

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
time we wondered how much more we can do

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.339 
time we wondered how much more we can do
with<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.789> sports<00:01:56.090> game<00:01:56.360> or<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.599> tennis<00:01:56.840> game<00:01:56.959> and

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
with a sports game or a tennis game and

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.050 
with a sports game or a tennis game and
I'm<00:01:57.770> sure<00:01:57.920> other<00:01:58.099> sports<00:01:58.399> game<00:01:58.610> developers

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
I'm sure other sports game developers

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.119 
I'm sure other sports game developers
might<00:01:59.209> be<00:01:59.360> feeling<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.720> same<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> found

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:01.129 
might be feeling the same but I found

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:02.830 
might be feeling the same but I found
that<00:02:01.310> VT<00:02:01.700> has<00:02:01.910> progressed<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.660> grown

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
that VT has progressed and grown

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.600 
that VT has progressed and grown
hand-in-hand<00:02:03.229> with<00:02:03.470> technology<00:02:03.950> first<00:02:04.459> on

hand-in-hand with technology first on
the<00:02:04.670> Dreamcast<00:02:05.119> where<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.569> could<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.840> the

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
the Dreamcast where you could have the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.109 
the Dreamcast where you could have the

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
first 3d polygon tennis game that very

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
first 3d polygon tennis game that very
impressive<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.869> more<00:02:09.349> recently<00:02:09.379> it's<00:02:09.950> moved

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
impressive and more recently it's moved

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.180

of sports games becoming more casual but
we<00:02:31.580> are<00:02:31.700> always<00:02:31.850> trying<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.150> keep<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:32.450> mind<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
we are always trying to keep in mind and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930 
we are always trying to keep in mind and
the<00:02:33.020> golden<00:02:33.290> will<00:02:33.440> we<00:02:33.560> try<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.830> stick<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.580> to

the golden will we try to stick to is to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640 
the golden will we try to stick to is to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
progression and leveling up there could

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.130 
progression and leveling up there could
be<00:02:45.800> seen<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.280> more<00:02:46.640> hardcore<00:02:47.120> aspect<00:02:47.570> so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
be seen as a more hardcore aspect so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.600 
be seen as a more hardcore aspect so
hardcore<00:02:48.410> gamers<00:02:48.800> may<00:02:48.980> hold<00:02:49.220> virtua<00:02:49.520> tennis

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
hardcore gamers may hold virtua tennis

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.880 
hardcore gamers may hold virtua tennis
in<00:02:50.030> high<00:02:50.209> regard<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> hardcore<00:02:51.080> game<00:02:51.410> but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
in high regard as a hardcore game but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.930 
in high regard as a hardcore game but
forget<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.520> actually<00:02:52.910> very

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
forget that it's actually very

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.630 
forget that it's actually very
accessible<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:53.930> well<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.830> control<00:02:55.190> system<00:02:55.520> is

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
accessible as well the control system is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.280 
accessible as well the control system is
very<00:02:55.850> simple<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.600> there<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.750> still<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.080> lot<00:02:57.260> of

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
very simple but there is still a lot of

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.840 
very simple but there is still a lot of
room<00:02:57.560> for<00:02:57.590> your<00:02:57.830> skill<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.280> improve<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:58.760> the

game so we always strive to achieve a
perfect<00:03:01.160> balance<00:03:01.459> between<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.330> two<00:03:02.540> when<00:03:03.350> we

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
perfect balance between the two when we

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.229 
perfect balance between the two when we
make<00:03:03.650> every<00:03:03.950> title<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.430> series<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:05.090> will

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
make every title in a series and we will

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.600 
make every title in a series and we will
continue<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.050> in<00:03:06.440> terms<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.340> Virtua

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
continue to do so in terms of Virtua

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.920 
continue to do so in terms of Virtua
Tennis<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:08.120> already<00:03:08.420> proven<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.780> have

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
Tennis it's already proven to have

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.870 
Tennis it's already proven to have
worked<00:03:09.170> well<00:03:09.440> for<00:03:09.709> over<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.950> decade<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.580> we

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
worked well for over a decade and we

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.160 
worked well for over a decade and we
should<00:03:11.030> expect<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> few<00:03:11.870> more<00:03:12.020> years

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
should expect to have a few more years

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.620 
should expect to have a few more years
left<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.650> come<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.160> series<00:03:13.489> but<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.360> think

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
left to come with the series but I think

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.060 
left to come with the series but I think
that<00:03:14.660> for<00:03:14.900> tennis<00:03:15.170> games<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.530> general<00:03:15.560> there

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
that for tennis games in general there

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.860 
that for tennis games in general there
is<00:03:16.100> room<00:03:16.370> for<00:03:16.400> both<00:03:16.610> hardcore<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.390> casual

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
is room for both hardcore and casual

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.110 
is room for both hardcore and casual
titles<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.470> little<00:03:19.100> bit

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.850
