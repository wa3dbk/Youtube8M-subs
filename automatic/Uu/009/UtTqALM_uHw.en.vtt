morning I never been up this late in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.480 
morning I never been up this late in
forever<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.420> seems<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.810> but

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
forever it seems like but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.160 
forever it seems like but
here<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:13.850> had<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> nice<00:02:14.210> little<00:02:14.390> run<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.960> first

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
here we had a nice little run on first

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.130 
here we had a nice little run on first
down<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:16.400> keep<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.850> chugging<00:02:17.510> away<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.990> another

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
down to keep on chugging away on another

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.200 
down to keep on chugging away on another
first<00:02:18.590> down<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:19.820> we<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.120> throw

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
first down and right here we just throw

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.000 
first down and right here we just throw
a<00:02:20.270> slant<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.260> catch<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.830> touchdown

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
a slant and we catch it for a touchdown

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
a slant and we catch it for a touchdown
I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:23.330> that's<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.540> lotta<00:02:23.690> more<00:02:24.460> must<00:02:25.460> I<00:02:25.670> think

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
I think that's a lotta more must I think

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.750 
I think that's a lotta more must I think
i'm<00:02:26.270> pretty<00:02:26.390> sure<00:02:26.510> i'm<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.830> these

i'm pretty sure i'm not sure these

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.010 
i'm pretty sure i'm not sure these
receivers<00:02:29.120> are<00:02:29.510> pretty<00:02:29.750> much<00:02:29.840> bums<00:02:30.970> hopefully

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
definitely something cool to look at in

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.020 
definitely something cool to look at in
the<00:04:11.450> game<00:04:11.660> but<00:04:12.020> um<00:04:12.230> right<00:04:13.160> here<00:04:13.370> he's<00:04:13.910> just

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
tried to hold him to at least three

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.870 
tried to hold him to at least three
points<00:04:23.750> or<00:04:23.900> nothing<00:04:24.410> but<00:04:24.650> hey<00:04:24.830> three<00:04:25.520> points

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
points or nothing but hey three points

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.620 
points or nothing but hey three points
is<00:04:25.970> better<00:04:26.120> than<00:04:26.270> that

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
is better than that

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.900 
is better than that
right<00:04:26.930> here<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.440> couldn't<00:04:28.190> get<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.370> tackle<00:04:28.790> he

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
right here I couldn't get the tackle he

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.700 
right here I couldn't get the tackle he
got<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.240> first<00:04:29.390> down<00:04:29.630> on<00:04:29.810> second<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.290> seven

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
got the first down on second and seven

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.560 
got the first down on second and seven
and<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.700> thought<00:04:31.850> right<00:04:32.000> there<00:04:32.060> was<00:04:32.300> gonna<00:04:32.390> be<00:04:32.480> a

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and I thought right there was gonna be a

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.080 
and I thought right there was gonna be a
face<00:04:32.810> mask<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:33.620> right<00:04:34.520> here<00:04:34.670> he<00:04:34.730> hits<00:04:34.970> me<00:04:35.000> a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
face mask but right here he hits me a

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.540 
face mask but right here he hits me a
play-action<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.930> he<00:04:36.080> gets<00:04:36.350> goes<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
play-action and he gets goes to the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.730 
play-action and he gets goes to the
outside<00:04:37.940> those<00:04:38.870> outside<00:04:39.320> routes<00:04:39.590> were

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
outside those outside routes were

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.440 
outside those outside routes were
killing<00:04:40.070> me<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.250> whole<00:04:40.430> game<00:04:40.700> he<00:04:41.060> kept<00:04:41.300> on

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
so basically the game is pretty much

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.760 
so basically the game is pretty much
