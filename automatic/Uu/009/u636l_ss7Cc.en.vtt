go for green but any of them will work

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240 
go for green but any of them will work
it<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:28.949> all

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it is really pretty if you can do all

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
it is really pretty if you can do all
three<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.910> then<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> traffic

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
three and then you get like the traffic

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.740 
three and then you get like the traffic
light<00:00:31.170> color<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.070> you're<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.790> your<00:00:33.000> salad<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750

yeah whatever whatever you have on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.180 
yeah whatever whatever you have on
handled<00:00:36.540> work<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.890> tied<00:00:38.040> into

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
handled work and then kind of tied into

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
handled work and then kind of tied into
that<00:00:38.430> though<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.030> am<00:00:39.570> blown<00:00:39.899> 420<00:00:40.710> Brock<00:00:42.110> said

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that though I am blown 420 Brock said

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.000 
that though I am blown 420 Brock said
that<00:00:44.149> suggested<00:00:45.149> using<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:46.010> seated

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that suggested using like seated

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
that suggested using like seated
jalapenos<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.480> guess<00:00:48.690> cut<00:00:48.870> into

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
jalapenos and then I guess cut into

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840 
jalapenos and then I guess cut into
strips<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.530> doing<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.280> which

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
strips and doing that that way which

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
strips and doing that that way which
reminded<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> sometimes<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.110> will

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
reminded me that sometimes I also will

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
reminded me that sometimes I also will
use<00:00:52.530> poblano<00:00:53.309> peppers<00:00:53.699> instead<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> bell

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
use poblano peppers instead of the bell

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
use poblano peppers instead of the bell
peppers<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.870> any<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> things

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
peppers so any of those kind of things

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.439 
peppers so any of those kind of things
will<00:00:56.160> work<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.579> depending<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.270> spicy

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
will work just depending on how spicy

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
will work just depending on how spicy
you<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.410> make<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.850> then<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you want to make it and then on the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.930 
you want to make it and then on the
blueberry<00:01:01.829> muffins<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.370> did<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.699> Mother's<00:01:02.910> Day

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
blueberry muffins i did for Mother's Day

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
blueberry muffins i did for Mother's Day
which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> tomorrow<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:04.080> forget<00:01:04.460> her<00:01:05.460> name

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
which is tomorrow don't forget her name

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
which is tomorrow don't forget her name
is<00:01:05.820> Sam<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> statuesque<00:01:07.200> 27<00:01:07.799> both<00:01:08.040> were

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is Sam and statuesque 27 both were

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
is Sam and statuesque 27 both were
asking<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> could<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.060> other<00:01:09.240> kinds<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
asking if you could use other kinds of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
asking if you could use other kinds of
berries<00:01:10.140> besides<00:01:10.500> blueberries<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> have

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
berries besides blueberries and I have

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020 
berries besides blueberries and I have
made<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.869> strawberries<00:01:13.530> before<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
made it with strawberries before and it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
made it with strawberries before and it
worked<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.680> grass

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
worked great so I think probably grass

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
worked great so I think probably grass
berries<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.729> work<00:01:17.909> too<00:01:18.200> with<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
berries would work too with the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
berries would work too with the
strawberry<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> probably<00:01:21.060> slice

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
strawberry so you want to probably slice

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
strawberry so you want to probably slice
them<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.500> cut<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:22.890> chunks<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.310> are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
them or cut up into chunks that are

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.580 
them or cut up into chunks that are
about<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> same<00:01:23.970> size<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> blueberry<00:01:24.960> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
about the same size as a blueberry just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.899 
about the same size as a blueberry just
so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.890> end<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> muffin<00:01:26.729> that's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so you don't end up with a muffin that's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
so you don't end up with a muffin that's
like<00:01:27.119> two<00:01:27.659> huge<00:01:28.110> strawberries<00:01:28.650> covered<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
like two huge strawberries covered in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
like two huge strawberries covered in
some<00:01:29.220> bad<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.549> something<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.780> yeah<00:01:30.900> any

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
some bad or something so but yeah any

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.719

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.999 
any kind of mixed berries raspberries
all<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> stuff<00:01:33.360> should<00:01:33.540> work<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.720> fine<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
all that stuff should work just fine and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.210 
all that stuff should work just fine and
then<00:01:35.759> Adam<00:01:36.450> bowling<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.290> also<00:01:37.890> said<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> he

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
then Adam bowling one also said that he

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.359 
then Adam bowling one also said that he
uses<00:01:38.909> kefir<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.840> his<00:01:40.380> blueberry<00:01:40.590> muffins<00:01:41.100> and
