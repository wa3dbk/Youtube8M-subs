00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.850
 what are you preparing then today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.220
 we prepare octopus and potatoes and fibula 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.160
 appetizer always a starter in this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.900
 case however hot 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.430
 then it is not the classic blow 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.559
 carrier but made with potatoes 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.070
 purple the purple potato cream is 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.840
 decisive 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.240
 the octopus instead is made in batter 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.360
 and then fried 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.620
 so let's start with potato cream 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.180
 warm purple 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.420
 the plate 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.940
 it is a cream prepared as it was then 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.280
 they see purple potatoes with light all over 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.510
 they do means 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.820
 then when you have boiled the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.989
 peel and then put themselves in the fork in the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.180
 blender and it makes a cream I am a 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.980
 little of water in this case I do not use 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.870
 let's say milk like how it's used to do 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.449
 what you do normal because if we 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.300
 pay to become pink, however 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.910
 aesthetically it is not the best though 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.930
 taste remains much more natural as well 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.520
 because there are no alterations 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.770
 using other products 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.759
 so it's a very, very good game 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.330
 natural here is then you put the cream 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.090
 we are on the plate previously 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.190
 Prepare some potato chips 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 purple dilated from raw come 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.149
 very simply accept that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.570
 they are put under running water for 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.220
 remove the starch then squeeze 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.159
 so let's say in the centrifuge for 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.500
 the salad and then they are fried 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.880
 salt and this point 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.140
 now it is the result of chicks of 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.180
 purple potatoes this is our phonic 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.460
 that we boiled 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.430
 previously as it always does then 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.160
 so much water in a big pot 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.040
 vegetables boil for three or four hours 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.050
 after which it cools these cuts a 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.350
 pieces and it passes the pastel and 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.450
 curtains already this is solved final 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.540
 because it arranges the very hot blow 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.540
 on the plate this way here 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.740
 then if he puts some maldon salt because 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.090
 however the crunchiness of the salt 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.050
 smiling put on of the quoted of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.060
 today they go to recall the cream and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.790
 then he had decided to put in the bath 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.320
 green the green bath since we are 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 in piedmont a bit our horse of 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.180
 battle but we need it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 in this case to degrease the frying 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 than usual 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.110
 and this is finished dish 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.540
 like potatoes this dish was 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.950
 prepared by federico allegri del 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.910
 mussi restaurant 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.910
 always frank
