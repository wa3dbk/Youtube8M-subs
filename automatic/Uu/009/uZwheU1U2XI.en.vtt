smooth

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's going to be a bit tutorial II I'm
afraid<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.280> can<00:01:57.430> see<00:01:57.670> how<00:01:58.150> the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
afraid and that you can see how the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.480 
afraid and that you can see how the
imagery<00:01:58.510> is<00:01:58.690> different<00:01:59.110> from<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.010> other

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
imagery is different from the other

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.610 
imagery is different from the other
versions<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.330> game<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:02.260> I'll<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.470> click

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
actually infinite apparently in the PC

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.720 
actually infinite apparently in the PC
and<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.270> Pocket<00:04:36.900> Edition<00:04:36.930> but<00:04:37.490> 36<00:04:38.490> times

obviously<00:04:41.580> a.m.<00:04:42.320> you'll<00:04:43.320> make<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.590> best<00:04:43.770> use

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
obviously a.m. you'll make the best use

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.409 
obviously a.m. you'll make the best use
of<00:04:44.010> those<00:04:44.310> worlds<00:04:44.730> if<00:04:44.880> you're<00:04:45.000> playing<00:04:45.240> with

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
of those worlds if you're playing with

of those worlds if you're playing with
other<00:04:45.480> people<00:04:46.220> you'll<00:04:47.220> have<00:04:47.370> lots<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.730> space

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
other people you'll have lots of space

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.909 
other people you'll have lots of space
to<00:04:48.000> run<00:04:48.270> around<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.900> build<00:04:49.080> huge<00:04:49.410> mansions

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
to run around in and build huge mansions

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.610 
to run around in and build huge mansions
and<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.419> where<00:04:51.900> Minecraft<00:04:52.320> shines

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
and that is where Minecraft shines

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.230 
and that is where Minecraft shines
really<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.280> with<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.729> console<00:04:54.000> version

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240

the only problem with this obviously is

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.020 
the only problem with this obviously is
that<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.240> would<00:05:40.810> show<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.100> four<00:05:42.100> player

daughter<00:05:45.760> 4<00:05:46.090> controllers<00:05:46.570> so<00:05:46.840> this<00:05:46.990> could<00:05:47.200> be

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
daughter 4 controllers so this could be

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.380 
daughter 4 controllers so this could be
potentially<00:05:47.920> prohibitive<00:05:48.790> for<00:05:49.000> people<00:05:49.270> who

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
potentially prohibitive for people who

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.060

the<00:05:54.070> DualShock<00:05:54.430> controllers<00:05:55.000> are<00:05:55.740> pretty

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
the DualShock controllers are pretty

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.900 
the DualShock controllers are pretty
expensive<00:05:56.980> and<00:05:57.430> what<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.610> would<00:05:57.700> normally

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
expensive and what I would normally

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.030 
expensive and what I would normally
recommend<00:05:58.300> is<00:05:58.870> using<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.800> Vita<00:06:00.610> as<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:02.040> another

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
recommend is using the Vita as a another

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.820 
recommend is using the Vita as a another
controller<00:06:03.700> but<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.570> Vita<00:06:04.780> doesn't<00:06:05.290> like<00:06:05.470> to

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
controller but the Vita doesn't like to

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.850 
controller but the Vita doesn't like to
display<00:06:06.100> split-screen<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:07.180> just<00:06:07.900> tried<00:06:08.110> it<00:06:08.140> so

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
display split-screen I just tried it so

there are a person playing with you
which<00:06:25.300> is<00:06:25.330> a<00:06:25.480> shame<00:06:25.720> but<00:06:26.590> this<00:06:26.710> is<00:06:26.830> pretty<00:06:26.980> cool

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
which is a shame but this is pretty cool

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.740 
which is a shame but this is pretty cool
anyway<00:06:27.220> the<00:06:27.730> split-screen<00:06:28.090> gives<00:06:28.510> you<00:06:28.600> lots

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
anyway the split-screen gives you lots

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.020 
anyway the split-screen gives you lots
of<00:06:28.870> space<00:06:29.170> and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.150 

means<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:32.750> can<00:06:32.960> look<00:06:33.770> at<00:06:33.860> each<00:06:33.980> other

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
means that you can look at each other

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.470 
means that you can look at each other
and<00:06:34.520> pay<00:06:34.700> with<00:06:34.820> your<00:06:34.940> friends<00:06:35.150> and<00:06:35.300> stuff

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
and pay with your friends and stuff

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.870 
and pay with your friends and stuff
which<00:06:35.870> is<00:06:35.990> pretty<00:06:36.140> cool<00:06:36.340> I'll<00:06:37.340> just<00:06:37.550> show<00:06:37.670> you

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
on the Vita and then I think we will

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.460 
on the Vita and then I think we will
leave<00:06:43.310> it<00:06:43.430> there<00:06:43.610> for<00:06:44.060> now<00:06:44.140> so<00:06:45.140> I<00:06:45.200> just<00:06:45.230> switch

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
leave it there for now so I just switch

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.130 
leave it there for now so I just switch
over<00:06:45.560> to<00:06:45.680> that<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:46.070> see<00:06:46.970> doesn't<00:06:47.270> quite<00:06:47.930> run

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
over to that and see doesn't quite run

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.930 
over to that and see doesn't quite run
as<00:06:48.290> smoothly<00:06:48.560> as<00:06:48.740> it<00:06:48.860> does<00:06:49.010> if<00:06:49.250> you're<00:06:49.400> just

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
as smoothly as it does if you're just

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.670 
as smoothly as it does if you're just
playing<00:06:50.360> it<00:06:50.480> directly<00:06:50.720> on<00:06:50.840> your<00:06:50.870> big<00:06:51.140> TV<00:06:51.350> but

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
playing it directly on your big TV but

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.170 
playing it directly on your big TV but
it's<00:06:51.800> pretty<00:06:52.070> cool<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.490> have<00:06:52.520> it<00:06:52.610> in<00:06:52.850> the<00:06:53.030> palm

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
it's pretty cool to have it in the palm

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.050 
it's pretty cool to have it in the palm
of<00:06:53.210> your<00:06:53.390> hands<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.490> like<00:06:55.490> I<00:06:55.580> said<00:06:55.640> you<00:06:55.850> can't

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060

what the Vita version might be like
