both<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.740> them<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.070> qualify<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
both of them and qualify to the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.630 
both of them and qualify to the
quarterfinals<00:01:26.840> it's<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.770> call<00:01:27.980> I<00:01:28.250> think<00:01:28.550> they

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
quarterfinals it's the call I think they

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.030 
quarterfinals it's the call I think they
need<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.850> come<00:01:28.940> with<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.810> normal<00:01:30.230> toughness

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
need to come with the normal toughness

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.600 
need to come with the normal toughness
that<00:01:31.220> they<00:01:31.370> have<00:01:31.580> on<00:01:31.790> defense<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:33.520> think<00:01:34.520> with

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
that they have on defense I think with

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.040 
that they have on defense I think with
Fenner<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.060> mean<00:01:35.210> yeah<00:01:35.420> with<00:01:35.570> efforts<00:01:35.930> they

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
Fenner I mean yeah with efforts they

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.600 
Fenner I mean yeah with efforts they
have<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.230> very<00:01:36.620> young<00:01:36.830> team<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.490> think

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
have a very young team so I think

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.910 
have a very young team so I think
Olympiakos<00:01:38.390> experience<00:01:39.050> will<00:01:39.350> allow<00:01:39.620> them<00:01:39.890> to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
Olympiakos experience will allow them to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.640 
Olympiakos experience will allow them to
you<00:01:40.790> know<00:01:40.880> overcome<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:41.480> team<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.050> with

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
you know overcome this team and with

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.260 
you know overcome this team and with
fenerbahçe<00:01:43.280> they<00:01:43.460> have<00:01:43.610> some<00:01:43.820> good<00:01:44.030> players

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
fenerbahçe they have some good players

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.690 
fenerbahçe they have some good players
but<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:45.140> think<00:01:45.410> their<00:01:45.560> toughness<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.250> what<00:01:46.490> will

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
but I think their toughness is what will

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180 
but I think their toughness is what will
be<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.270> key<00:01:47.420> for<00:01:47.630> them<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.810> win<00:01:47.960> your<00:01:48.830> opinion

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
be the key for them to win your opinion

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.530 
be the key for them to win your opinion
