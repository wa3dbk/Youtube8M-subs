00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 today 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.780
 this new video that is going to be treated this 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.600
 good video well as you will see is the title 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.340
 that will be in the next session of 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.250
 minecraft or what said in what will be the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.460
 zero point 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 6.0 and well that's supposed to be how 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 will see how they are seeing on screen 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.109
 how are you going to see 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 when they take out the update 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.470
 these and this image is 100% real because 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.110
 is I took it from the official website of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.290
 more yang and good so that's how it goes 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.199
 see and for quick devices to have 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.230
 the clouds not for everyone but for example 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.020
 for my ipad here I have it fourth 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.790
 generation here is 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 this is and then be able to have so 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 Well soon I will bring videos and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.600
 when I break 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.600
 as well 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.740
 because that way I'll be able to record and good 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.860
 so here it is in life as it is already 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.060
 right now and here the armor and good other 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.530
 images that this is another supposed 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.880
 course but I think this is not going to be 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 real well why 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.189
 I did not take this from the official website 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.659
 but it can also be like that there are 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.030
 true let me in the comments which one 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.970
 I would like more this is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 either of the two there is something else 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.330
 It is also that you will be able to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.490
 can read textures to minecraft because 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.490
 how to see here select starbucks 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.420
 here will be default after 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.409
 and here is another one that is something known 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.009
 so it can also bring textures 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.479
 what many also expect is the chat 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.299
 but this I think is not going to come in this 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.390
 decision will come in the next of the 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:10.410
 0.6 to maybe 0.7 or not be 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.080
 So, that's the way it is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 would see 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.569
 these things would also be the new 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.510
 version as I told you a while ago 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.180
 this so I will give the version with the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.780
 new version the clouds and good another 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.730
 it would also be a form of the armor 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.579
 how would you put it when you're in the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.280
 inventory and it would be like that but the truth is not 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.560
 I think this is because you were here 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.730
 a page that does not the original and the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.129
 original since this image is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.069
 so I guess it's going to be like that I do not know 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.170
 maybe there is the day inventory that says 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.590
 armor itches if you leave this you already put 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 your armor 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.050
 and already and this new block would also come out 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.940
 these new blocks 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.380
 as you can see, this is the same as 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.380
 introduced in the snap shots 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.790
 of minecraft from the pc and also this 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.790
 new and peculiar 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.580
 what is it called to make it so 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.810
 and here is the full information if 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.819
 they want to go to the page and read everything 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.230
 good to leave you someone in the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.290
 description 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.880
 and well let's see what it says 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.510
 what is it going to bring 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.400
 he says he's going to bring signs 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.880
 posters 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.480
 these things 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.220
 here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.740
 the animal armor posters 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.340
 the new clouds that are these 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.940
 from above 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.940
 the new leg and says that this thing 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.849
 the new groove stone water 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.860
 by christina or be a new one a new 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.870
 like a furnace but different that is going to 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.870
 help make these these blocks 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.320
 now he says that the sheep are going to be able 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.609
 to be colored you hide that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.060
 is the painting that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:30.129
 new types of rac blocks of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.960
 bric blog of words the pse I do not know what 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:35.600
 then pillar 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.000
 the 'crack' of smooth which is that of the 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.690

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 the stairs down 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.770
 and then that sand and gravel now 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.950

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.470
