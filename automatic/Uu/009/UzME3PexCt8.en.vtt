that's<00:00:46.410> cool<00:00:46.590> anyway<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.520> talk<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.760> how

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that's cool anyway let's talk about how

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
that's cool anyway let's talk about how
I<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> game<00:00:49.200> itself<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
I got on with the game itself and as you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670 
I got on with the game itself and as you
can<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.879> 2d<00:00:51.680> side-scrolling

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can see it is a 2d side-scrolling

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.150 
can see it is a 2d side-scrolling
shooter<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.530> important

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
shooter but one of the more important

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
shooter but one of the more important
aspects<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.329> got<00:00:57.420> itself

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
aspects of this is that it's got itself

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
aspects of this is that it's got itself
a<00:00:58.230> cover<00:00:58.649> mechanic<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.940> diving<00:01:00.359> in

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a cover mechanic so you're not diving in

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
a cover mechanic so you're not diving in
and<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> cover<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> adds<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and out of cover and it just adds this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
and out of cover and it just adds this
tactical<00:01:03.660> element<00:01:03.809> tool<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.320> really

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
tactical element tool that's really

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.340 
tactical element tool that's really
interesting<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> even<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.689> early<00:01:06.960> stage

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
interesting and even at this early stage

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.270 
interesting and even at this early stage
of<00:01:07.710> disease<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.400> its<00:01:08.490> alpha<00:01:09.060> build<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
of disease in its alpha build it is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
of disease in its alpha build it is
working<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> sort<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
working really well it's a sort of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
working really well it's a sort of
mechanical<00:01:13.170> level<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> basic

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
mechanical level you know the basic

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.380 
mechanical level you know the basic
select<00:01:15.450> build<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.290> quite<00:01:16.710> solid<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
select build is quite solid and you I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
select build is quite solid and you I
got<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> general<00:01:19.200> sense<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a very integral part with me if you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
a very integral part with me if you
don't<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.990> die<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.840 
you know you've got to be time your
shots<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:46.979> careful<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
shots and be really really careful as we

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
shots and be really really careful as we
can<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> guys<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.259> cover<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.619> ahead

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
can see now that guys can cover up ahead

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.819 
can see now that guys can cover up ahead
and<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> reload<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:52.619> charge

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and as I go to reload it will charge

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.200 
and as I go to reload it will charge
mean<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:53.970> quite

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
mean that that's actually quite

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
mean that that's actually quite
dangerous<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.750> you've<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:54.990> lots<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
dangerous when you've got lots of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.810 
dangerous when you've got lots of
enemies<00:01:55.619> around<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.430> you've<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.759> be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
enemies around you so you've got to be

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
enemies around you so you've got to be
very<00:01:56.850> careful<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.570> you've<00:01:57.750> got<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> right

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
very careful that you've got the right

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
very careful that you've got the right
ammo<00:01:58.380> or

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ammo or

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.730 
ammo or
reload<00:02:01.090> when<00:02:01.420> you've<00:02:01.570> got<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:02.140> safe<00:02:02.470> place<00:02:02.680> to

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
reload when you've got a safe place to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.410 
reload when you've got a safe place to
hide<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.340> mean<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> missing<00:02:03.970> Lee<00:02:04.060> one<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.360> the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
hide I mean a missing Lee one of the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.970 
hide I mean a missing Lee one of the
things<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.720> thought<00:02:05.080> was<00:02:05.200> quite<00:02:05.320> all<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.770> I

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
things I thought was quite all is that I

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.050 
things I thought was quite all is that I
could<00:02:06.370> use<00:02:06.640> my<00:02:06.820> reload<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.390> lower<00:02:07.750> enemies<00:02:08.200> in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
could use my reload to lower enemies in

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.610 
could use my reload to lower enemies in
at<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.180> very<00:02:10.330> last<00:02:10.450> second<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.440> that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
at the very last second so you know that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
at the very last second so you know that
you<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:11.920> use<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.610> placed<00:02:12.910> traps<00:02:13.150> if

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you can use it to so I placed traps if

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.150 
you can use it to so I placed traps if
you<00:02:13.570> wanted<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.990> like<00:02:14.230> fool<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.800> enemy<00:02:14.890> into

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you wanted to like fool the enemy into

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.370 
you wanted to like fool the enemy into
thinking<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:16.930> safe<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:17.230> them<00:02:17.320> to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
thinking that that it's safe for them to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.820 
thinking that that it's safe for them to
charge<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.570> but<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.530> whole<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.800> was

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
charge you but on the whole it was

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.450 
charge you but on the whole it was
really<00:02:21.250> satisfying<00:02:21.430> very<00:02:22.650> very<00:02:23.650> bloody<00:02:23.920> as

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
really satisfying very very bloody as

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.380 
really satisfying very very bloody as
you<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.230> exceptionally<00:02:26.230> hard<00:02:27.390> but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
you see there and exceptionally hard but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720 
you see there and exceptionally hard but
it's<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.140> those<00:02:29.230> games<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.770> feel<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.400> you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
it's one of those games I feel that you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.370 
it's one of those games I feel that you
notice<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.630> going<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.870> want<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.080> try<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
notice you're going to want to try and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.290 
notice you're going to want to try and
do<00:02:32.530> again<00:02:32.860> again<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.120> there

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
do again again as you can see there

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.230 
do again again as you can see there
you've<00:02:34.480> got<00:02:34.510> scores<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.410> combos<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:37.060> like

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
you've got scores and combos and so like

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.990 
you've got scores and combos and so like
time<00:02:37.540> limits<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.140> there's<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.890> sense<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.670> some

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
time limits so there's a sense of some

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.630 
time limits so there's a sense of some
competitiveness<00:02:40.810> about<00:02:41.680> at<00:02:41.890> all<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.190> want<00:02:42.580> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
competitiveness about at all you want to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.470 
competitiveness about at all you want to
make<00:02:42.730> sure<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.880> you've<00:02:43.090> got<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> best

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
make sure that you've got the best

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.920 
make sure that you've got the best
scores<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.850> think<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.480> really

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
scores and and I think this is really

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.290 
scores and and I think this is really
where<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.160> hero<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.520> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.850> find<00:02:49.060> its

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
where not a hero is going to find its

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.050 
where not a hero is going to find its
longevity<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:50.650> mean<00:02:51.040> yes<00:02:51.280> there<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.910> whole

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
longevity I mean yes there is this whole

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.210 
longevity I mean yes there is this whole
thing<00:02:52.270> about<00:02:52.390> being<00:02:52.750> able<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.020> unlock<00:02:53.740> new

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
thing about being able to unlock new

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.280 
thing about being able to unlock new
characters<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.840> they<00:02:55.960> have<00:02:56.140> new

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
characters and so that they have new

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.380 
characters and so that they have new
abilities<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.980> things<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:57.790> I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
abilities and things like that but I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.450 
abilities and things like that but I
think<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.810> terms<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.440> like<00:02:59.650> finding<00:03:00.310> that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
think in terms of like finding that

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.940 
think in terms of like finding that
perfect<00:03:00.820> run<00:03:01.360> or<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> getting<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.800> best

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
perfect run or so I getting the best

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.790 
perfect run or so I getting the best
score<00:03:03.340> all<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.000> best<00:03:04.209> time<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.590> is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
score all the best time I think that is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.199 
score all the best time I think that is
really<00:03:06.100> where<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.400> want<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> come<00:03:06.880> down<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
really where I want to come down and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.400 
really where I want to come down and
play<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.510> hope<00:03:07.630> there's<00:03:07.840> some<00:03:08.050> sort<00:03:08.230> of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
play and I hope there's some sort of

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.610 
play and I hope there's some sort of
select<00:03:08.770> online<00:03:09.480> leaderboard<00:03:10.480> vaps<00:03:10.810> each<00:03:11.440> or

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
select online leaderboard vaps each or

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.140 
select online leaderboard vaps each or
even<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.160> local<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.970> just

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
even just a local one but it's it just

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.120 
even just a local one but it's it just
having<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.810> sense<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.290> competitive<00:03:14.800> us<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
having that sense of competitive us I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.970 
having that sense of competitive us I
think<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.580> really<00:03:15.640> going<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.270> play<00:03:16.510> too<00:03:17.260> not<00:03:17.950> a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
think is really going to play too not a

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.880 
think is really going to play too not a
hero<00:03:18.190> strength<00:03:18.670> but<00:03:19.470> yes<00:03:20.470> as<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.739> can<00:03:20.830> see

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
hero strength but yes as you can see

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.520 
hero strength but yes as you can see
they're<00:03:21.040> mashed<00:03:21.250> into<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.820> level<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:23.410> what

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
they're mashed into the level like what

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.860 
they're mashed into the level like what
gives<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.890> full<00:03:24.850> total<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.270> how<00:03:25.360> well<00:03:25.540> he<00:03:25.660> did

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
