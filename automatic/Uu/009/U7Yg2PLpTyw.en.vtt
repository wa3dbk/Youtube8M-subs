 Here we are and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.540
 then this time I choose this morse 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 with the metal sight and we go to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.850
 blow let's see how it goes this time 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.500
 per hour with the metal sight that in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.539
 so many of you have advised me 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 let's see some in the first episode gone 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.699
 I really have a lot more attention here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.920
 one by one with a smooth one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 smooth for me attention that appears 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 a beautiful speech a bite shot of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.399
 no immediacy to a screwed us has 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.489
 made that dubious attention here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.799
 on the map I thought you were a friend 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.070

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 we basically went bad in this one 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 I don't like the game, I don't want to go 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.540
 we are winning and this is the thing 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.880
 important 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.350
 someone is jumping over where 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.709

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.070

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.160
 I find it better to come with that shit, no 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.260
 maybe this should be okay 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.010
 even smaller maps as a type 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.080

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.299
 that you know I'm not great 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.480
 sniper made little game and nothing though 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.420
 it's mode is really fun is 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.450
 I was hiding I was hiding no choral 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.500
 how easy it is with that one 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.050
 here is one that opens both of them yes ok 61 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.440
 when it goes well anyway we are reborn 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.860

 oh well okay bullet had left before 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.960
 at least I know that in the sense 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.530
 it would be comfortable to get caught 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.750
 meanwhile stories on call of duty that 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.550
 takes jesus butterfield and the chance 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.520
 that if you can dive or enemy 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 not beautiful in flight is not for is not 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.070
 dead the thing that takes if you spar is a 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.840
 enemy that is, it hits you first and then 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.840
 the arrival that dies too he understood 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.060
 that wouldn't be as bad as what because 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.340
 it would give you a few pounds above all 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.090
 more to one like me than many times of the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.380
 sniper punches to treason does not do the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.740
 its better 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.090
