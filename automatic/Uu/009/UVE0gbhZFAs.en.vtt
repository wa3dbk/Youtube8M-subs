 Article 9 of the Constitution 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.759
 since it deals with heritage protection 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.350
 national art we took then 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.390

 we can say we did this 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.100
 project also in their honor 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.640

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.650
 others 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.230
 kymco still the concept of justice 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.320

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 further study concerning why 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.220

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.620
 to carry out this project we have 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.060
 It made several researches from 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.400
 definition of a refugee 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.610
 political up to various stories 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.030
 of refugee women we have integrated a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.770
 series of videos with considerations in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.060
 plus we also did ballets with 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.970
 plus a small rap sung piece 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.610
 they said that different does not exist 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.830
 appellation to give to all christ 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.650
 everyone is good in that these 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.540
 appellatives and those like them for me 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 they are repeat offenders 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.080
 we opened our school at 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.860
 public during the eighth day 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.410

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.090
 this neglect that still continues one 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.209
 time as in the excavations as the same 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.110

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.110
 political refugees 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.930
 I have also taken care of the others 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.939
 nations it is not right to judge the others 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.950
 people and in any case we must not give 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.170
 for granted 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.120
 there is their path because it is a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.970
 difficult path and I consider myself very much 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.230
 lucky to have what to us in 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.120

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
 we will do it we will not do it and the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.810

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.879

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.260

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.850
 never discriminated against because women 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.750
