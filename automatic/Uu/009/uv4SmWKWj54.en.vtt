want to check the court comes down to
the<00:05:53.259> wire<00:05:54.210> how<00:05:55.210> viable<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.750> lot<00:05:55.930> of<00:05:56.020> these<00:05:56.139> seeds

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
the wire how viable a lot of these seeds

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.760 
the wire how viable a lot of these seeds
are<00:05:56.620> so<00:05:57.310> I'm<00:05:57.460> going<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:58.080> one<00:05:59.080> pizza<00:05:59.380> box<00:05:59.590> I'll

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
are so I'm going to one pizza box I'll

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.480 
are so I'm going to one pizza box I'll
give<00:05:59.889> me<00:06:00.010> ten<00:06:00.780> varieties<00:06:01.780> of<00:06:02.190> ten<00:06:03.190> plants

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
give me ten varieties of ten plants

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.129 
give me ten varieties of ten plants
attend<00:06:03.820> varieties<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:04.960> would<00:06:05.050> be<00:06:05.110> a

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
attend varieties and that would be a

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.610 
attend varieties and that would be a
good<00:06:05.260> number<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.650> see<00:06:05.800> if<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:06.010> okay<00:06:06.340> fine

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
good number to see if I okay fine

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.870 
good number to see if I okay fine
only<00:06:08.620> five<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:09.010> them<00:06:09.130> come<00:06:09.280> up<00:06:09.310> then<00:06:09.580> I<00:06:09.669> got<00:06:09.849> a

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
only five of them come up then I got a

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.450 
only five of them come up then I got a
fifty<00:06:10.210> percent<00:06:10.360> germination<00:06:10.720> rate<00:06:11.380> and<00:06:11.590> that

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
fifty percent germination rate and that

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.950 
fifty percent germination rate and that
will<00:06:12.610> help<00:06:12.729> me<00:06:12.820> to<00:06:12.940> determine<00:06:13.330> how<00:06:13.690> many<00:06:13.930> I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
will help me to determine how many I

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.909 
will help me to determine how many I
should<00:06:14.260> plant<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:15.699> make<00:06:15.880> sure<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:17.830> know

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
should plant to make sure that you know

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.129 
should plant to make sure that you know

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
I'll do another video on on what seeds

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.159 
I'll do another video on on what seeds
I'm<00:06:35.889> putting<00:06:36.250> in<00:06:36.400> there<00:06:36.639> and<00:06:36.849> what<00:06:37.659> seeds<00:06:37.990> uh

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
I'm putting in there and what seeds uh

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.260 
I'm putting in there and what seeds uh
how<00:06:38.889> well<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.310> seeds<00:06:39.580> are<00:06:40.139> working<00:06:41.139> I'm<00:06:41.800> also

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
how well the seeds are working I'm also

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.490 
how well the seeds are working I'm also
going<00:06:43.270> to<00:06:45.599> try<00:06:46.599> some

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
going to try some

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.029 
going to try some
grocery<00:06:49.500> store<00:06:49.830> seed<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:51.199> see<00:06:52.199> how<00:06:52.410> well<00:06:52.710> they

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
grocery store seed and see how well they

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.790 
grocery store seed and see how well they
germinate<00:06:53.639> how<00:06:54.360> well<00:06:54.660> they<00:06:54.840> produce<00:06:55.440> I'm

going to go ahead and do a pile of those

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.550 
going to go ahead and do a pile of those
in<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:59.490> greenhouse<00:06:59.970> this<00:07:00.300> year<00:07:00.690> so<00:07:01.080> that<00:07:01.380> we

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
in the greenhouse this year so that we

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.140 
in the greenhouse this year so that we
can<00:07:01.800> we<00:07:02.160> can<00:07:02.310> see<00:07:02.520> how<00:07:02.669> well<00:07:04.190> that<00:07:05.190> variety

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
can we can see how well that variety

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.999 
can we can see how well that variety
will<00:07:07.699> grow<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.870> we're<00:07:10.530> just<00:07:10.680> going<00:07:10.800> to<00:07:10.889> try
