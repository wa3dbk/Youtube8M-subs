00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
like completely flat on the phone so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.189 
like completely flat on the phone so
there's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> small<00:00:24.119> air<00:00:24.420> gap<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> screen

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

there's a small air gap on the screen
and<00:00:25.439> when<00:00:25.650> typing<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.189> tapping<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.699> feels<00:00:26.910> more

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and when typing or tapping it feels more

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.279 
and when typing or tapping it feels more
like<00:00:27.150> an<00:00:27.390> old<00:00:27.539> resistive<00:00:28.109> touch<00:00:28.260> screen

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
like an old resistive touch screen

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.200 
like an old resistive touch screen
rather<00:00:28.830> than<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> capacitive<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.000> used

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
rather than a capacitive one we're used

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
rather than a capacitive one we're used
to<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.590> deliberate

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to and you have to be more deliberate

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
to and you have to be more deliberate
when<00:00:32.219> using<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> screen<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> does

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
when using the screen but it does

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
when using the screen but it does
completely<00:00:34.050> protect<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.860> even<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> touch

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
completely protect it and even the touch

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
switch it by twisting it it's pretty

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
switch it by twisting it it's pretty
interesting<00:00:46.050> also<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> bottom<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> have

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
only issue with these coverings is that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
only issue with these coverings is that

really hard the rubber that covers them

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
really hard the rubber that covers them
is<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.260> too<00:00:58.410> stiff<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> makes<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is just too stiff and it makes the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
is just too stiff and it makes the
buttons<00:00:59.699> nearly<00:01:00.090> useless<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
clear so you can still see the phone and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
clear so you can still see the phone and
the<00:01:03.719> camera<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.080> protected<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> still

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the camera is protected but it still

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
this case is that it's waterproof ip68

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
this case is that it's waterproof ip68
certified<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> five<00:01:13.560> meters

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
certified so it can go up to five meters

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
certified so it can go up to five meters
deep<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> still<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.729> protected<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.930> only

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
deep and still be protected the only

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
deep and still be protected the only
kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> scary<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> case<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
kind of scary thing about the case is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
kind of scary thing about the case is
that<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> flap<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> bottom<00:01:18.570> seems<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> bit

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that the flap on the bottom seems a bit

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
that the flap on the bottom seems a bit
flimsy<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.830> mean<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.430> work<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.119> there

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
flimsy I mean it does work but if there

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
flimsy I mean it does work but if there
