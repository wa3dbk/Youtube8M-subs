00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
a tinge of blue to it you know normally

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.350 
a tinge of blue to it you know normally
you<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.860> black<00:04:00.129> handles<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.180> these

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
you have the black handles on on these

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.009 
you have the black handles on on these
trees<00:04:01.680> these<00:04:02.680> enduros<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:04.420> one<00:04:04.600> came<00:04:04.840> out

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
trees these enduros this one came out

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.259 
trees these enduros this one came out
with<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.350> blue<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.430> flat<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.060> full

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
with the blue I know the flat the full

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.259 
with the blue I know the flat the full
flat<00:04:07.510> ground<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.190> durrës<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.730> multiple

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269

multiple<00:04:10.690> colors<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.730> boy<00:04:15.970> detent<00:04:16.630> which

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
multiple colors the boy detent which

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:24.510 
multiple colors the boy detent which
basically<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:21.430> it's<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:23.220> think<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.430> was

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
basically I think it's I think it was

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.909 
basically I think it's I think it was
put<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:24.789> to<00:04:25.620> decrease<00:04:26.620> when<00:04:26.770> you're

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
put there to decrease when you're

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.430 
put there to decrease when you're
pressing<00:04:27.250> down<00:04:27.430> did<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.849> crease<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.479> the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
pressing down did you crease the the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.029 
pressing down did you crease the the
likelihood<00:04:30.039> of<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:30.460> actually<00:04:32.039> disengaging

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
likelihood of this actually disengaging

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.800 
likelihood of this actually disengaging
which<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.340> don't<00:04:33.490> think<00:04:33.669> would<00:04:33.789> do<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.720> they

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
which I don't think would do but they

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.800 
which I don't think would do but they
put<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.229> in<00:04:35.440> there<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> few<00:04:35.740> years<00:04:35.950> back<00:04:36.460> I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
put that in there a few years back I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.120 
put that in there a few years back I
have<00:04:37.810> some<00:04:37.960> spider<00:04:38.260> codes<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:38.979> don't

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
have some spider codes that but don't

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.420 
have some spider codes that but don't
have<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:40.260> or<00:04:41.260> one<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:41.560> have<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.889> native<00:04:42.280> that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
have it or one I have a native that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.330 
have it or one I have a native that
doesn't<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:42.820> that<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:44.650> they<00:04:44.800> they<00:04:45.039> added

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
doesn't have that but they they added

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.830 
doesn't have that but they they added
that<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.610> there<00:04:45.729> but<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:45.910> think<00:04:46.090> also<00:04:46.270> if<00:04:46.690> you're

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
that in there but I think also if you're

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.500 
that in there but I think also if you're
handling<00:04:47.260> your<00:04:47.500> knife<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.889> night<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:49.270> be<00:04:49.419> able

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
handling your knife at night to be able

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.560 
handling your knife at night to be able
to<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.080> feel<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:51.729> know<00:04:51.910> exactly<00:04:52.330> where

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
to you feel that you know exactly where

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.360 
to you feel that you know exactly where
the<00:04:53.200> lock<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:55.570> lock<00:04:55.750> button<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:57.099> close

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
the lock the lock button is to close

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.010 
the lock the lock button is to close
your<00:04:57.550> knife<00:04:59.220> so<00:05:00.220> that's<00:05:00.400> helpful<00:05:00.669> there<00:05:01.020> but

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
your knife so that's helpful there but

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.930 
your knife so that's helpful there but
here's<00:05:02.289> some<00:05:02.770> comparisons<00:05:03.460> in<00:05:03.729> size<00:05:05.700> here<00:05:06.700> is

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
here's some comparisons in size here is

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.920 
here's some comparisons in size here is
the<00:05:09.750> Chris<00:05:10.750> Reid<00:05:10.990> Sebenza

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
the Chris Reid Sebenza

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.770 
the Chris Reid Sebenza
and<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.919> can<00:05:13.100> see<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.669> a<00:05:13.850> large<00:05:14.090> knife<00:05:14.389> and

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
and you can see it's a large knife and

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.150 
and you can see it's a large knife and
it<00:05:14.900> actually<00:05:15.259> is<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.350> little<00:05:15.440> bit<00:05:15.650> larger<00:05:16.130> than

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
it actually is a little bit larger than

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.439 
it actually is a little bit larger than
the<00:05:16.610> Sebenza<00:05:17.020> pretty<00:05:18.020> close<00:05:18.290> though<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:22.449> here

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
the Sebenza pretty close though and here

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:40.120 
the Sebenza pretty close though and here
is<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.139> ZT<00:05:28.030> 0<00:05:29.030> 5<00:05:29.419> 6<00:05:29.870> 1<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:34.150> here<00:05:35.150> is<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:39.919> that's

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
is the ZT 0 5 6 1 and here is and that's

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.279 
is the ZT 0 5 6 1 and here is and that's
not<00:05:40.400> in<00:05:40.639> the<00:05:41.120> frame<00:05:41.419> so<00:05:41.449> let<00:05:41.780> me<00:05:41.870> get<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.139> in

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
not in the frame so let me get this in

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.189
