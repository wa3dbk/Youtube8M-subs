back<00:01:13.140> forward<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.909> go<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.299> an

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
back forward and back don't go into an

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
back forward and back don't go into an
extreme<00:01:15.930> level<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.560> extension<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.030> safe

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
extreme level of extension so it's safe

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
extreme level of extension so it's safe
as<00:01:18.479> long<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> stay<00:01:18.990> within<00:01:19.020> mid<00:01:19.500> ranges

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
as long as you stay within mid ranges

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
as long as you stay within mid ranges
and<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> end<00:01:20.790> ranges<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.680> going

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and don't go to end ranges so I'm going

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.410 
and don't go to end ranges so I'm going
to<00:01:22.890> lean<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.520> holding<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> weight<00:01:24.240> like

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
to lean in I'm holding the weight like

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
to lean in I'm holding the weight like
this<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.220> 20

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
this so now the way this could be 20

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.100 
this so now the way this could be 20
pounds<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.240> 280<00:01:27.540> pounds<00:01:27.930> whatever

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
pounds could have 280 pounds whatever

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.319 
pounds could have 280 pounds whatever
you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.470> support<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.970> giving<00:01:30.299> me

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you can support it's giving me

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can support it's giving me
resistance<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.680> forward

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
resistance and I'm going to go forward

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.390 
resistance and I'm going to go forward
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> back<00:01:33.329> forward<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.799> ups

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and then the back forward and back ups

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
and then the back forward and back ups
two<00:01:35.640> reps<00:01:36.079> for<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.200> outs<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.229> five<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
two reps for your outs for it five and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.030
