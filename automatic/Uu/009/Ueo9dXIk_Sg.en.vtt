 Economic metropolitan students who are mostly living in dormitories and private life is hard 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:24.849
 The local students were carrying out the study room and the examination room. 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.849
 This is a drug . 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.060
 Mr. Kim, Yeong - Su Iing using a private residence in the province of blame to go through the house

 However , convenience facilities such as convenience stores and cafe health clubs are well-equipped. 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:50.330
 So it's not easy to move to another place

 I 'm comfortable with my keys, learning to study, expensive, no cards, anything.

 4 million won 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.400
 3 times the level of general dormitory. 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.380
 550,000 won for practice 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:17.150
 It is more than twice as expensive as a house in Konkuk University ( 540,000 won). 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.240
 Expensive gotta keep the intellectual college students came Amenities Students Welfare

 Total Taemin is right. 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:49.960
 Because of this, most students have to go to the gymnasium and cheap one-room . 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.710
 Although rented housing is being provided rather than dormitories, conditions and procedures 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.410
 It is rice cake for the students who are demanding college students. 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.899
 It's too expensive .

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.470
 I think it would be helpful to expand public rental housing for young people. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.160
