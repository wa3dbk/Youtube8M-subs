00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 you like to recycle because today we are going to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.519
 recycle something that is in all houses 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.130
 the toilet paper cardboard and we're going 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.969
 to turn into a box as pretty as 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 this for it we are going to need a 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.369
 piece of cloth that we like the roll of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.000
 cardboard toilet paper gun 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 silicone a loop and scissors to cover 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.340
 the leftover roll we need a piece 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 of fabric 16 centimeters wide and 9 and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 medium high so let's dial in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.990
 the rectangle piece of cloth with these 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.810
 measurements and we will remember them 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.120
 us to cut out fabric we use 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.310
 a pair of scissors in the shape of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 triangle so that the fabric does not 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.910
 fraying 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.400
 now we draw some lines with the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.490
 silicone gun across the width of the roll 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.560
 of cardboard and then we will place the fabric 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.560
 around very carefully 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.360
 we put a little bit of silicone in the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.360
 piece of cloth that is left over and we stick 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.030
 now without pressing too hard 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.490
 we bend the ends of the roll of this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.630
 way and we already have the flaps of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 our box closed 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.890
 Y 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.710
 to give a decorative touch and ensure 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.620
 the closing of the box we will place a 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.830
 tie around this one of the next 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.830
 shape 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.509
 it's ready we have a nice box 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.030
 ideal to decorate a nice detail 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.980
 to give if we also introduce you 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.980
 some candies or chocolates
