it's just a little bag I mean it's just
a<00:00:46.390> little<00:00:46.570> case<00:00:46.750> really<00:00:47.050> but<00:00:47.380> it<00:00:47.680> does<00:00:48.100> fit<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
a little case really but it does fit the

a little case really but it does fit the
ipad<00:00:49.120> mini<00:00:49.150> perfect<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.110> this<00:00:50.320> isn't<00:00:50.620> really

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
ipad mini perfect and this isn't really

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
first noticed off the bat is that it has

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.889 
first noticed off the bat is that it has
these<00:01:14.020> walls<00:01:14.590> right<00:01:14.889> here<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.969> protect<00:01:16.359> it

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
these walls right here to protect it

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.410 
these walls right here to protect it
from<00:01:17.170> hitting<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.740> zipper<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:19.179> give<00:01:19.299> it

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
from hitting the zipper and to give it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.969 
from hitting the zipper and to give it
some<00:01:19.600> extra<00:01:19.780> side<00:01:20.259> cushion<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.799> thought

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
some extra side cushion so I thought

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.429

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you're all set to go so I thought that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.930

smart<00:02:26.890> cover<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.520> fits<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.209> even<00:02:28.660> better<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.170> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
smart cover it fits in even better it is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.589 
smart cover it fits in even better it is
admittedly<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:30.819> tight<00:02:31.030> with<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
admittedly it's a little tight with the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.630 
admittedly it's a little tight with the
Smart<00:02:31.900> Cover<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.290> without<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.190> smart<00:02:33.430> cover

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
Smart Cover on without the smart cover

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.150

either<00:02:36.760> way<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.180> perfect<00:02:37.630> though<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.989> mean<00:02:38.230> it

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
either way it's perfect though I mean it

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.780 
either way it's perfect though I mean it
really<00:02:38.470> doesn't<00:02:38.800> add<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> lot<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.160> bulk<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.640> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
really doesn't add a lot of bulk to it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.460 
really doesn't add a lot of bulk to it
