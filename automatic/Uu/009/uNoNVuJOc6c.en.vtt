hey guys Foehammer 2003 here part of tgn
with<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> quick<00:00:13.920> guide<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.429> how<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.700> get<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.330> tox

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
with a quick guide on how to get the tox

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.560 
with a quick guide on how to get the tox
off<00:00:15.900> flight<00:00:16.199> achievement<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:18.060> easily<00:00:18.330> as

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
off flight achievement and as easily as

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.929 
off flight achievement and as easily as
possible<00:00:20.150> okay<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.939> recorded

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
possible okay and I would have recorded

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.429 
possible okay and I would have recorded
the<00:00:24.060> footage<00:00:24.449> where<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:24.990> got<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the footage where I actually got the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
the footage where I actually got the
achievement<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.490> easier<00:00:26.849> than<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
achievement but I got it easier than I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.470 
achievement but I got it easier than I
expected<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.849> topped<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.240> like

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
expected so there it is topped off like

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
expected so there it is topped off like
killer<00:00:30.720> target<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.260> centimeters<00:00:31.800> amal<00:00:32.099> with

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
center of the island is the Amana Kai

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
center of the island is the Amana Kai
outpost<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> call<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.629> manky

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
outpost as I like to call it a manky

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.600 
outpost as I like to call it a manky
outpost<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:48.210> same<00:00:48.420> place<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:49.070> or<00:00:50.070> area

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
outpost the same place where or area

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
outpost the same place where or area
well<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> did<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.420> last<00:00:51.539> video<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
well I did my last video on how to get a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.369 
well I did my last video on how to get a
takedown<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.860> blow<00:00:53.129> over<00:00:53.190> easily<00:00:54.289> now<00:00:55.289> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
takedown from blow over easily now if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
takedown from blow over easily now if
you<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.559> too<00:00:55.620> far<00:00:56.010> struggle<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.520> outpost

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you go too far struggle to that outpost

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
you go too far struggle to that outpost
make<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.780> you've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> recurve<00:00:58.500> bow

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
make sure you've got the recurve bow

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.979 
make sure you've got the recurve bow
equipped<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.649> literally<00:01:01.649> run<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.430> drive

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
equipped and literally run or drive

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
equipped and literally run or drive
directly<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> outpost<00:01:04.640> maybe<00:01:05.640> slightly

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
directly from the outpost maybe slightly

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
directly from the outpost maybe slightly
to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> perfect

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to the right to get to the perfect

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
to the right to get to the perfect
position<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.560> roughly<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
position which is here roughly and the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.859 
position which is here roughly and the
reason<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> Ledge<00:01:14.869> very

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
reason for that is there is a Ledge very

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
reason for that is there is a Ledge very
close<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:17.009> where<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.280> enemies<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.840> just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
close by to where the enemies are just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.190 
close by to where the enemies are just
here

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.490 

okay<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.750> spot<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> couple<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.229> enemies

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
okay so spot a couple of the enemies

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.789 
okay so spot a couple of the enemies
they<00:01:25.460> are<00:01:25.490> roughly<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.110> ones<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
they are roughly the the ones in the

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.550 
they are roughly the the ones in the
middle<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.130> road<00:01:28.280> for<00:01:28.430> example<00:01:29.229> are<00:01:30.229> about

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
middle of the road for example are about

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.080 
middle of the road for example are about
80<00:01:30.830> meters<00:01:31.100> away<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:32.180> average<00:01:32.710> which<00:01:33.710> is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
80 meters away on average which is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.260 
80 meters away on average which is
plenty<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.700> need<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.970> get<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
plenty for what you need to get the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.450 
plenty for what you need to get the
achievement<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:39.710> typical<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
achievement it's typical that the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.029 
achievement it's typical that the
farthest<00:01:40.850> ones<00:01:41.210> away<00:01:41.479> are<00:01:41.780> Kony<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.440> eaten<00:01:42.830> as

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
farthest ones away are Kony and eaten as

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.240 
farthest ones away are Kony and eaten as
I'm<00:01:43.220> recording<00:01:43.789> this<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.830> never<00:01:45.830> goes<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.009> plan

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
I'm recording this I never goes to plan

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.880 
I'm recording this I never goes to plan
does<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.930> but<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:47.960> should<00:01:48.200> be<00:01:48.229> enough<00:01:48.409> distance

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
does it but it should be enough distance

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.789 
does it but it should be enough distance
even<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.390> get<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.600> achievement<00:01:51.020> what

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
even so and to get the achievement what

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.109 
even so and to get the achievement what
you<00:01:51.890> want<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.100> do<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.399> want<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.549> craft<00:01:52.820> some

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
you want to do is you want to craft some

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.389 
you want to do is you want to craft some
explosive<00:01:53.630> tipped<00:01:53.869> arrows<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:54.920> make<00:01:55.069> sure<00:01:55.100> you

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
explosive tipped arrows so make sure you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.359 
explosive tipped arrows so make sure you
also<00:01:55.550> have<00:01:55.729> some<00:01:56.119> grenades<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.369> the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
also have some grenades on you and the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.600 
also have some grenades on you and the
marksman<00:01:59.179> scope<00:01:59.450> mod<00:01:59.810> for<00:02:00.229> your<00:02:01.039> recurve<00:02:01.399> bow

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
marksman scope mod for your recurve bow

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.020 
marksman scope mod for your recurve bow
bow

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
bow

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.389 
bow
so<00:02:05.030> we'll<00:02:05.179> craft<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.539> few<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.869> those<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:07.280> in

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
so we'll craft a few of those just in

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.729 
so we'll craft a few of those just in
case<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.640> doesn't<00:02:07.789> work<00:02:07.880> first<00:02:08.209> time<00:02:11.739> there

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
case it doesn't work first time there

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.050 
case it doesn't work first time there
you<00:02:12.920> go<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.340> he's<00:02:13.489> probably<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:13.850> too

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
you go so he's probably a little too

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.600 
you go so he's probably a little too
close<00:02:14.769> well<00:02:15.769> now<00:02:15.890> when<00:02:16.069> you're<00:02:16.190> firing<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
close well now when you're firing the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.130 
close well now when you're firing the
bow<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.239> don't<00:02:17.450> use<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.600> very<00:02:17.750> often<00:02:17.930> like

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
bow if you don't use it very often like

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.539 
bow if you don't use it very often like
I<00:02:18.260> don't<00:02:18.319> make<00:02:18.769> sure<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.100> when<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.340> pull

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
I don't make sure that when you pull

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.070 
I don't make sure that when you pull
back<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> arrow<00:02:20.030> leave<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> couple<00:02:20.989> of

back the arrow leave it a couple of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.570 
back the arrow leave it a couple of
seconds<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:21.830> give<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.160> maximum

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
seconds that will give you the maximum

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.059 
seconds that will give you the maximum
distance<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.560> explosive

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
distance on it now with the explosive

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.890 
distance on it now with the explosive
bows<00:02:25.250> as<00:02:25.549> long<00:02:25.850> as<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> explosion<00:02:26.299> kills<00:02:26.690> them

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
bows as long as the explosion kills them

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.979 
Bassett's
it<00:02:27.890> qualifies<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.730> kill<00:02:29.890> well<00:02:30.890> if<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.989> equip

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
it qualifies as a kill well if I equip

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.790 
it qualifies as a kill well if I equip
them<00:02:33.170> first<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.739> helps

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:50.860 

let<00:02:37.800> go<00:02:38.900> too<00:02:39.900> close<00:02:40.850> too<00:02:41.850> far<00:02:42.060> we're<00:02:42.240> soy

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.460 

totally<00:02:51.870> soy<00:02:52.200> bus

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.050 

well<00:02:58.470> anyway<00:02:59.100> hopefully<00:02:59.550> we'll<00:02:59.790> get<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.000> in

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
well anyway hopefully we'll get it in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.450 
well anyway hopefully we'll get it in
one<00:03:00.210> like<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.720> did<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.930> first<00:03:00.960> time<00:03:01.460> typical

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
one like I did the first time typical

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.190 
one like I did the first time typical
that<00:03:02.580> when<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:02.790> recording<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.330> doesn't<00:03:03.840> go<00:03:03.960> so

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that when I'm recording it doesn't go so

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.670 
that when I'm recording it doesn't go so
easily

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
easily

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.520 
easily
but<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:06.300> it's<00:03:06.480> as<00:03:06.600> simple<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.960> as<00:03:07.380> long

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
but yeah it's as simple as that as long

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.870 
but yeah it's as simple as that as long
as<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:07.710> get<00:03:07.890> killed<00:03:08.100> by<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.310> explosive<00:03:08.580> flow

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
as they get killed by the explosive flow

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.440 
as they get killed by the explosive flow
and<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.380> all<00:03:10.560> good<00:03:11.030> alternatively<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.330> can

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and it's all good alternatively you can

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.280 
and it's all good alternatively you can
headshot<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.490> just<00:03:14.490> like<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.290> discrete

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
headshot them just like this discrete

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.340 
headshot them just like this discrete
for<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.500> standard<00:03:16.890> error<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:18.300> that's<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.230> lot

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
for the standard error but that's a lot

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.910 
for the standard error but that's a lot
harder

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
harder

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.710 
harder
