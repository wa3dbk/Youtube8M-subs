00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.819
 well in this video I will give you my 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.299
 predictions about the next event of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.299
 support for 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 as you should know the next event 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.969
 of apple will be held this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 Wednesday and in case they are not yet 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170
 aware here I leave the link to a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.470
 video that explains everything around this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.080
 event 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.669
 now let's start with my predictions or 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.519
 rather with what I would like 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.410
 was announced during this event 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.509
 obviously I'll start by mentioning that 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
 I would love to see a new iphone and 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.470
 I think that most of the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.809
 people too but as he has already spoken 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.430
 a lot of this topic in this video no longer 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.530
 I'll talk about rumors about the iPhone 5 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.780
 but in case you want to be at 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.790
 so much of them here I leave these two 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.950
 videos 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.780
 something that has been rumored and that I 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 It would seem very funny to be done 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.890
 reality is that probably the number 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.410
 5 that can be seen in the invitation 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.110
 of the event refers to a new ipod 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.570
 toch fifth generation and not to a new 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.730
 iphone honestly I do not think so 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.770
 What I do think is probable is that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.380
 apart from a new iphone it is also 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.540
 present a new ipod touch since this 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.460
 device had virtually no 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 changed last year more than being 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.340
 available in white 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 and since we 're talking about ipads I do not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 It would seem weird that they will also be announced 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.960
 the new generations of the ipod nano and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.570
 sofa 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.970
 a and v6 could also be an issue that 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.950
 I hope you tap the event I do not think 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.900
 announce your official departure that same day 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.090
 but I guess they will do some 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.970
 demonstrations and hopefully announce that there 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.920
 v6 will be available to the public on the day 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.190
 of the official output of iphone 5 or 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.810
 before regarding the ipad mini 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.729
 honestly I do not think it has 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.920
 as presented Wednesday 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.509
 is likely that this device has 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 with your own event in the month of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.009
 October and here I leave another video in the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.190
 which I talk about all the ipad rumors 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.929
 mini the new generation of imac that 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 It is also something that many people 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.550
 hopefully, in this event they are 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.100
 presented although they would seem to me 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.399
 too many important announcements so 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.349
 probably this is not your event 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.810
 I also think that apple should 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.000
 devote some small space of time 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.640
 to explain to the world your problem in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.049
 around patents with samsung and all 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.629
 we know that they were the winners 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.010
 in this conflict and that samsung them 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.319
 You will have to pay an amount 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.090
 impressive of money but it would be 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.190
 interesting to know the point of view of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.120
 apo around this topic 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.920
 basically this is what from my 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.570
 point of view could happen in the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.960
 Apple event next Wednesday 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.760
 although conapo you never know the only thing 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.220
 I hope is that many new ones 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.680
 quality products and hopefully Paul 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.480
 have us some surprises already saved 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 that has not impressed us for a long time 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.569
 as I did before 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 do not forget that I will have all the 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.590
 live coverage of this event by 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.720
 middle of sticky social networks 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.090
 check which are appearing in 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 screen and you can also find them 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.810
 in the description of the video just like 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.150
 the links to all the videos that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.370
 I mentioned during this video 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.650
 let me know in the comments what 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.890
 they wait for the next support event and if 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.260
 they consider that there will be some surprises 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.690
