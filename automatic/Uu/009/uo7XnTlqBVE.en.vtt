00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and hello to everyone, it's Christmas 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.720
 per month it's myriam a yes it's christmas 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 and on this very special occasion 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:19.470
 you will receive gifts 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:20.580
 how to say he is not waiting for the balloon 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
 yet caroline I thought about 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.510
 gifts to offer and in fact I 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.010
 thought a little bit a whole person 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.849
 a little bit romantic is also very 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.949
 expressive 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.610
 so here I think I found the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:39.390
 most suitable gift a pen is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 what's this gift to but it's also that the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 Christmas magic 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
