00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 touching of quito after the agreements very well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.790
 four players that's about the second string 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.600
 upmann

 that is we are 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.069
 the seventh after being 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.659
 we climb 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 we do not run a block 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.889
 we continue touring other 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.429
 the 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.369
 if we were here 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.739
 let's go 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.869
 while eta is still alive 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.760
 we know 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 the fret number 2 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.749
 bush we decided to do 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 an efe degree 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.099
 rudder bush that 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.099
 I do not understand is this 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.079
 not even that 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.589
 do not 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.589
 according 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 I can not observe in detail 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.779
 inm 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.779
 do not 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.559
 binner 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.559
 in the min 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.009
 binner 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.679
 do not 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.579
 according 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 according 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.199
 that decision 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.929
 Can be combined with the third 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.369
 and it would be as follows 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.369
 min 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.210
 at 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 in him thousand 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 from that time of day 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.379
 the president was going 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.080
 of peace insists defend because I know that these exercises can be 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.400
 dangerous 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.020
 I think you are very effective 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.000
 would be the fourth exercise and then we will see
