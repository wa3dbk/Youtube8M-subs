00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
taking it a little far so anyway this is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
taking it a little far so anyway this is
the<00:01:03.000> linear<00:01:03.329> pattern<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.870> death<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.559> that's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799

the linear pattern of death right that's
it's<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.970> reason<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.299> named<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> so

those stickings together and you get

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:32.880 
those stickings together and you get
this<00:02:17.830> pattern<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.870> that's<00:02:32.140> sticking<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
this pattern now that's sticking in and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.770 
this pattern now that's sticking in and
of<00:02:32.950> itself<00:02:33.220> when<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.430> break<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.360> not

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
of itself when you break it down is not

of hip now really the thing is is what
do<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:44.920> do<00:02:45.280> with<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.519> pattern<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.090> makes

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
do you do with that pattern that makes

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.630 
do you do with that pattern that makes
it<00:02:46.510> cool<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:47.290> add<00:02:47.470> some<00:02:47.799> accents<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.459> there

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640

accents wherever you want to really I

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.600 
accents wherever you want to really I
accent<00:02:53.410> anytime<00:02:53.769> there's<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.040> single<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
accent anytime there's a single on the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.699 
accent anytime there's a single on the
hi-hat<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.239> groove<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.720> accident<00:02:56.560> and

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
hi-hat in this groove I accident and

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.550 
hi-hat in this groove I accident and
anytime<00:02:57.220> there's<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.670> double<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.900> hi-hat<00:02:59.110> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
anytime there's a double on the hi-hat I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.949 
anytime there's a double on the hi-hat I
accent<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.220> second<00:03:00.670> double<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> first

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
accent the second double so the first

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:12.410 
accent the second double so the first
pattern<00:03:02.140> sounds<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:10.799> second<00:03:11.799> pattern

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
pattern sounds like this second pattern

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.870 
pattern sounds like this second pattern
and<00:03:14.250> third<00:03:15.250> pattern<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.400> actually<00:03:21.579> kind

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and third pattern so it's actually kind

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.490 
and third pattern so it's actually kind
of<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.030> simple<00:03:22.390> framework<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.049> built<00:03:23.350> that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
of a simple framework that I built that

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.160 
of a simple framework that I built that
around<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:24.160> make<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.579> groove<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.690> where<00:03:26.049> did

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
around to make that groove now where did

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.069 
around to make that groove now where did
I<00:03:26.290> put<00:03:26.319> my<00:03:26.590> snare<00:03:27.160> accents<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.239> snare<00:03:28.569> accent

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
I put my snare accents the snare accent

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.620 
I put my snare accents the snare accent
comes<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:30.310> first<00:03:30.579> pattern<00:03:31.030> its<00:03:31.239> foot

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
comes and that first pattern its foot

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.250 
comes and that first pattern its foot
right<00:03:32.410> left<00:03:33.190> right<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.150> then<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.690> other<00:03:34.900> left

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
right left right and then the other left

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.750 
right left right and then the other left
comes<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.799> downbeat<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.220> two<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.730> I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
comes on the downbeat of two so I

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.190 
comes on the downbeat of two so I
thought<00:03:36.970> well<00:03:37.120> I'll<00:03:37.239> put<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> accent<00:03:37.989> there

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
thought well I'll put the accent there

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.580 
thought well I'll put the accent there
so<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:38.859> foot<00:03:39.220> right<00:03:39.819> left<00:03:40.269> right<00:03:40.590> accented

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
so it's foot right left right accented

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.009 
so it's foot right left right accented
left<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> snare<00:03:42.430> then<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.600> next

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
left on the snare then we have that next

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.240 
left on the snare then we have that next
pattern<00:03:44.200> what's<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.590> next<00:03:44.739> pattern<00:03:45.069> its

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
pattern what's that next pattern its

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.640 
pattern what's that next pattern its
foot<00:03:45.579> right<00:03:45.850> left<00:03:46.180> well<00:03:46.600> what<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.260> drag

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
foot right left well what I do is I drag

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.849 
foot right left well what I do is I drag
that<00:03:47.920> left<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.370> when<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.609> drag<00:03:48.910> something

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
that left now when you drag something

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.990 
that left now when you drag something
you're<00:03:50.859> just<00:03:50.889> kind<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.459> easiest<00:03:51.819> way<00:03:51.970> to

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
you're just kind of the easiest way to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.240 
you're just kind of the easiest way to
say<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.630> press<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.530> into<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.920> snare<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
say that is to press it into the snare a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.590 
say that is to press it into the snare a
drag<00:03:54.609> doesn't<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> certain<00:03:55.630> number<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:56.459> of

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
drag doesn't have a certain number of of

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.120 
drag doesn't have a certain number of of
beats<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:58.930> drag<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.319> it's<00:03:59.470> just<00:03:59.680> drugged

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
beats that you drag it it's just drugged

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.039 
beats that you drag it it's just drugged
basically<00:04:00.519> across<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.880> snare<00:04:01.209> now<00:04:01.540> buzz<00:04:01.840> are

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
basically across the snare now buzz are

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.420 
basically across the snare now buzz are
all<00:04:02.139> very<00:04:02.380> similar<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.950> stroke<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.340> would

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
all very similar to the stroke you would

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.449 
all very similar to the stroke you would
do<00:04:03.519> for<00:04:03.549> a<00:04:03.730> buzz<00:04:03.940> roll

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
do for a buzz roll

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.670 
do for a buzz roll
okay<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.659> very<00:04:06.719> different<00:04:07.170> from<00:04:07.230> an<00:04:07.379> open

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
okay it's very different from an open

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.539 
okay it's very different from an open
stroke<00:04:07.859> role<00:04:12.469> right<00:04:13.469> now<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:14.010> can<00:04:14.280> either

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
stroke role right now you can either

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.430 
stroke role right now you can either
double<00:04:14.939> that<00:04:15.269> note<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.569> you<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:15.900> go<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.109> this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.710 

or<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.799> can<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.160> drag<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:23.419> then<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.570> have

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
or you can just drag it then you have

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.600 
or you can just drag it then you have
that<00:04:24.930> third<00:04:25.199> sticking<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.860> third<00:04:26.100> sticking

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that third sticking the third sticking

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.760 
that third sticking the third sticking
is<00:04:26.729> going<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.360> have<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.660> accent<00:04:28.139> at<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.440> left

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
is going to have the accent at the left

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.150 
is going to have the accent at the left

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:59.740 
hand so and then we put that whole thing
together<00:04:46.680> slowly<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.490> we<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.699> our<00:04:47.820> groove

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.870 

so<00:05:00.750> there<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.169> have<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.740> linear<00:05:02.220> pattern<00:05:02.490> kind

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
so there you have a linear pattern kind

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.460 
so there you have a linear pattern kind
of<00:05:02.970> built<00:05:03.210> into<00:05:03.479> a<00:05:03.630> groove<00:05:03.930> really<00:05:04.199> linear

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
of built into a groove really linear

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.529 
of built into a groove really linear
patterns<00:05:04.860> don't<00:05:05.130> mean<00:05:05.370> anything<00:05:06.210> until<00:05:06.360> you

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
patterns don't mean anything until you

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.960 
patterns don't mean anything until you
add<00:05:06.720> accents<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.740> them<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.070> once<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.310> do<00:05:08.520> they

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
add accents to them and once you do they

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.909 
add accents to them and once you do they
kind<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.300> come<00:05:09.449> to<00:05:09.570> life<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.020> now<00:05:10.380> I've<00:05:10.620> taught

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
kind of come to life so now I've taught

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.000 
kind of come to life so now I've taught
you<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.250> linear<00:05:11.639> pattern<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.330> death<00:05:12.750> right<00:05:13.199> so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
you the linear pattern of death right so

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.500 
you the linear pattern of death right so
you<00:05:14.099> can<00:05:14.250> kill<00:05:14.490> your<00:05:14.669> gig<00:05:14.880> next<00:05:15.060> time<00:05:15.300> whatever

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
you can kill your gig next time whatever

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.170 
you can kill your gig next time whatever
