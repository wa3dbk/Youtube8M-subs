I<00:02:47.150> was<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.750> only<00:02:48.050> real<00:02:51.400> disappointment<00:02:52.400> I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
I was the only real disappointment I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.090

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
guess if I have to that's kind of a push

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.240 
guess if I have to that's kind of a push
forward<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.330> know<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.990> just<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:58.010> video

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
forward but you know it's just the video

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.960 
forward but you know it's just the video
quality<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.510> not<00:02:59.990> amazing<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.160> it's<00:03:01.520> good<00:03:01.790> for

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
quality is not amazing but it's good for

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.180 
quality is not amazing but it's good for
practice<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:02.930> good<00:03:03.140> if<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.380> want<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.709> for

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
practice it's good if you want to for

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.860 
practice it's good if you want to for
example<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:04.760> somewhere<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.300> take<00:03:05.480> videos<00:03:05.840> and
