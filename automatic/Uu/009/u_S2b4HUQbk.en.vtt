00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.410 
to spawn in where you want them to spawn
in<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.340> basically<00:00:40.850> just<00:00:41.030> being<00:00:41.180> able<00:00:41.300> to

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
in and basically just being able to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.000 
in and basically just being able to
control<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.930> zombies<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:42.710> gonna<00:00:42.890> get

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
control the zombies so it's gonna get

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.410 
control the zombies so it's gonna get
this<00:00:43.130> shit<00:00:43.250> started<00:00:43.430> alright<00:00:44.060> so<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.240> first

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
this shit started alright so the first

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.670 
this shit started alright so the first
thing<00:00:44.540> you<00:00:44.600> have<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.810> probably<00:00:45.020> know<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.470> this

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
thing you have to probably know is this

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.470 
thing you have to probably know is this
isn't<00:00:45.980> really<00:00:46.160> for<00:00:46.490> early<00:00:46.940> round<00:00:47.210> so

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
isn't really for early round so

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.690 
isn't really for early round so
basically<00:00:48.050> up<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.200> like<00:00:48.410> around<00:00:48.560> 15<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.340> 20

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
basically up to like around 15 to 20

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.950 
basically up to like around 15 to 20
really<00:00:50.150> depending<00:00:50.450> on<00:00:50.540> what<00:00:50.630> your<00:00:50.750> skill

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
really depending on what your skill

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.900 
really depending on what your skill
level<00:00:50.990> is<00:00:51.320> usually<00:00:51.830> on<00:00:52.130> certain<00:00:52.400> Maps<00:00:52.580> I<00:00:52.730> can

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
level is usually on certain Maps I can

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.460 
level is usually on certain Maps I can
last<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.210> like<00:00:53.330> around<00:00:53.480> 20<00:00:53.840> or<00:00:53.930> 30<00:00:54.080> -<00:00:54.260> sitting

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
last a like around 20 or 30 - sitting

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.410 
last a like around 20 or 30 - sitting
there<00:00:54.590> camping<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.400> strategy<00:00:55.820> only<00:00:56.210> goes

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
there camping this strategy only goes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.760 
there camping this strategy only goes
with<00:00:56.630> actually<00:00:56.930> joining<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.260> strategy<00:00:57.740> or

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
with actually joining a strategy or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.260 
with actually joining a strategy or
trying<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.130> cycle<00:00:58.490> or<00:00:58.580> something<00:00:58.820> like<00:00:58.880> that

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
trying to cycle or something like that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.819 
trying to cycle or something like that
this<00:00:59.570> does<00:00:59.750> not<00:00:59.870> actually<00:01:00.200> go<00:01:00.320> with<00:01:00.380> camping

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
this does not actually go with camping

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.170 
this does not actually go with camping
so<00:01:00.950> under<00:01:01.160> Rhys<00:01:01.340> I<00:01:01.520> could<00:01:01.730> literally<00:01:01.910> sit<00:01:02.060> on

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
so under Rhys I could literally sit on

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.760 
so under Rhys I could literally sit on
that<00:01:02.270> catwalk<00:01:02.630> up<00:01:02.870> until<00:01:03.140> around<00:01:03.260> 30<00:01:03.560> if<00:01:03.710> I

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
that catwalk up until around 30 if I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.859 
that catwalk up until around 30 if I
wanted<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:04.339> given<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:04.939> proper<00:01:05.000> guns<00:01:05.479> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
wanted to if given the proper guns and

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.540 
wanted to if given the proper guns and
on<00:01:06.049> Ascension<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.680> could<00:01:06.830> probably<00:01:07.040> last<00:01:07.370> in

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
on Ascension I could probably last in

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.430 
on Ascension I could probably last in
certain<00:01:07.820> areas<00:01:08.090> -<00:01:08.240> like<00:01:08.360> around<00:01:08.510> 15<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.140> 20

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
certain areas - like around 15 to 20

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.810 
certain areas - like around 15 to 20
then<00:01:09.860> after<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.190> I'm<00:01:10.310> gonna<00:01:10.430> start<00:01:10.640> running

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
then after that I'm gonna start running

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.010 
then after that I'm gonna start running
strategies<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:11.720> what<00:01:11.840> we've<00:01:11.930> shown

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
strategies so that's what we've shown

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.420 
strategies so that's what we've shown
you<00:01:12.170> guys<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.440> on<00:01:12.530> Ascension<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.310> guess

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
you guys is on Ascension so I guess

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and the reason for this is you want the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
and the reason for this is you want the
zombies<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:35.990> spawn<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:36.530> fast<00:01:36.770> as<00:01:37.040> possible

you<00:01:37.970> want<00:01:38.090> them<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.270> spawn<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.750> hurry<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.229> get

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
you want them to spawn in hurry up get

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.510 
you want them to spawn in hurry up get
bunched<00:01:39.650> together<00:01:39.799> somewhere<00:01:40.280> there's<00:01:40.430> no

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
bunched together somewhere there's no

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.860 
bunched together somewhere there's no
more<00:01:40.670> spawning<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.420> basically<00:01:41.570> have

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
more spawning in and you basically have

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.899 
more spawning in and you basically have
the<00:01:41.990> group<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.290> 24<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:43.190> case<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.490> guys<00:01:43.580> didn't

the group of 24 in case you guys didn't

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.550 
the group of 24 in case you guys didn't
know<00:01:43.940> 24<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.870> max<00:01:45.080> number<00:01:45.260> of<00:01:45.440> zombies

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
know 24 is the max number of zombies

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.050 
know 24 is the max number of zombies
that<00:01:45.830> can<00:01:45.950> spawn<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.610> doesn't<00:01:46.880> matter<00:01:47.000> if

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
that can spawn it doesn't matter if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.370

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
zombies to hurry up and spawn in so well

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.450 
zombies to hurry up and spawn in so well
you<00:01:54.680> can<00:01:54.799> start<00:01:54.950> training<00:01:55.280> them<00:01:55.369> up

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
you can start training them up

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.219 
you can start training them up
immediately<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.150> quickly<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:56.540> possible<00:01:56.960> and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the best way to do this is they get a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.649 
the best way to do this is they get a
strategy<00:01:58.670> going<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.390> see<00:01:59.510> I'm

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
strategy going on and you can see I'm

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.940 
strategy going on and you can see I'm
doing<00:01:59.689> it<00:01:59.930> on<00:01:59.960> Ascension<00:02:00.290> I'm<00:02:00.530> probably<00:02:00.710> doing

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
doing it on Ascension I'm probably doing

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.230 
doing it on Ascension I'm probably doing
it<00:02:01.040> one<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.250> most<00:02:01.369> easiest<00:02:01.640> spots<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
learning how to run proper strategies so

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.289 
learning how to run proper strategies so
you<00:02:07.010> can<00:02:07.130> see<00:02:07.220> right<00:02:07.369> up<00:02:07.549> here<00:02:07.580> I'm<00:02:07.820> on<00:02:07.939> PhD

zombies as soon as I spawn in that's a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.670 
zombies as soon as I spawn in that's a
definite<00:02:31.940> no-no<00:02:32.150> two<00:02:32.600> reasons<00:02:32.960> one<00:02:33.200> you're

definite no-no two reasons one you're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.900 
definite no-no two reasons one you're
definitely<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.100> way<00:02:34.220> stammering<00:02:34.610> like<00:02:34.700> that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
definitely in a way stammering like that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.030 
definitely in a way stammering like that
and<00:02:35.120> two<00:02:35.660> new<00:02:36.320> zombies<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.680> gonna<00:02:36.860> keep

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
and two new zombies are just gonna keep

spawning<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.550> you're<00:02:37.730> not<00:02:37.820> really<00:02:37.970> gonna<00:02:38.090> be

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
spawning it you're not really gonna be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.850 
spawning it you're not really gonna be
able<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.390> properly<00:02:38.660> control<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.320> zombies<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.460 
want to be able to control the zombies
by<00:02:41.270> getting<00:02:41.480> them<00:02:41.600> all<00:02:41.810> spawned<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
by getting them all spawned in and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.380 
by getting them all spawned in and
following<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:43.520> killing<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.270> them

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
following you not killing one of them

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.610 
following you not killing one of them
and<00:02:44.570> then<00:02:44.660> another<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:45.050> spawning<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.500> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and then another one spawning in you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.110 
and then another one spawning in you
don't<00:02:45.740> want<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.340> want<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.760> zombies<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
don't want that you want the zombies to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.730 
don't want that you want the zombies to
be<00:02:47.210> all<00:02:47.390> spawned<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.050> while<00:02:48.560> they're

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
be all spawned in so while they're

be all spawned in so while they're
spawning<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.160> try<00:02:49.640> not<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.910> kill<00:02:50.090> any<00:02:50.240> unless

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
spawning in try not to kill any unless

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.210 
spawning in try not to kill any unless
you<00:02:50.660> absolutely<00:02:50.810> have<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.710> again<00:02:52.160> this

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
really appeals for sort of high around

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.300 
really appeals for sort of high around
if<00:02:53.780> you're<00:02:53.900> still<00:02:54.050> like<00:02:54.200> around<00:02:54.350> ten<00:02:54.710> by<00:02:55.190> all

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
means killing a zombie that you see but

hell even fifty you want to let the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.200 
hell even fifty you want to let the
zombies<00:03:00.860> spawn<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.370> do<00:03:01.520> not<00:03:01.670> kill<00:03:01.910> them<00:03:02.060> as

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
zombies spawn in so do not kill them as

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.280 
zombies spawn in so do not kill them as
they<00:03:02.360> are<00:03:02.450> spawning<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:03.020> if<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.170> do

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
they are spawning in because if you do

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.540 
they are spawning in because if you do
that<00:03:03.410> they're<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.650> gonna<00:03:03.770> keep<00:03:03.950> spawning<00:03:04.280> in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
that they're just gonna keep spawning in

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.160 
that they're just gonna keep spawning in
and<00:03:04.670> spawning<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.090> you're<00:03:05.480> gonna<00:03:05.570> waste<00:03:05.810> ammo

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
and spawning in you're gonna waste ammo

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.210 
and spawning in you're gonna waste ammo
and<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.380> might<00:03:06.560> actually<00:03:06.830> disrupt<00:03:07.100> your

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and they might actually disrupt your

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.920 
and they might actually disrupt your
strategy<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:07.820> don't<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:08.270> always<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
strategy so don't do that always the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930 
strategy so don't do that always the
design<00:03:09.200> was<00:03:09.320> completely<00:03:09.950> spawn<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.850> then

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
design was completely spawn in and then

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.730 
design was completely spawn in and then
once<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.300> all<00:03:11.510> 24<00:03:12.020> zombies<00:03:12.350> right<00:03:12.530> behind

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
once you get all 24 zombies right behind

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.050 
once you get all 24 zombies right behind
you<00:03:12.920> go<00:03:13.100> do<00:03:13.220> whatever<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.550> want<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.910> want

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you go do whatever you want if you want

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.430 
you go do whatever you want if you want
to<00:03:14.120> kill<00:03:14.270> them<00:03:14.360> go<00:03:14.750> ahead<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.960> kill<00:03:15.170> them<00:03:15.320> and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
to kill them go ahead and kill them and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.560 
to kill them go ahead and kill them and
then<00:03:15.530> run<00:03:15.710> that<00:03:15.740> same<00:03:16.100> strategy<00:03:16.370> again<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.450> if

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
then run that same strategy again but if

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.700 
then run that same strategy again but if
you're<00:03:17.600> gonna<00:03:17.990> kill<00:03:18.230> them<00:03:18.380> make<00:03:18.530> sure<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
you're gonna kill them make sure you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.230 
you're gonna kill them make sure you
kill<00:03:18.890> them<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.250> proper<00:03:19.520> location<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.120> don't

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
kill them in a proper location you don't

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.040 
kill them in a proper location you don't
want<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.420> kill<00:03:20.570> them<00:03:20.690> when<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:20.990> a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
want to kill them when you're in a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.660 
want to kill them when you're in a
dangerous<00:03:21.380> position<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.430> don't<00:03:22.550> want

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
dangerous position like you don't want

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.830 
dangerous position like you don't want
to<00:03:22.730> kill<00:03:22.910> them<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.240> middle<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.570> narrow

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
to kill them in a middle of a narrow

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.090 
to kill them in a middle of a narrow
hallway<00:03:24.110> because<00:03:24.380> then<00:03:24.590> they're<00:03:24.710> gonna<00:03:24.800> spawn

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
hallway because then they're gonna spawn

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.860 
hallway because then they're gonna spawn
in<00:03:25.280> front<00:03:25.490> of<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.850> I'm<00:03:26.270> back<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.720> and

right up here near PhD flopper I just
kill<00:03:34.880> them<00:03:35.000> right<00:03:35.030> there<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.870> were<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.050> take

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
kill them right there if I were to take

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.690 
kill them right there if I were to take
them<00:03:36.260> through<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> trap<00:03:36.800> I<00:03:37.010> want<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.400> know<00:03:37.490> which

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
them through a trap I want to know which

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700 
them through a trap I want to know which
direction<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.210> have<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.420> go<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.600> front<00:03:39.380> or<00:03:39.530> back

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
direction I have to go to front or back

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.900 
direction I have to go to front or back
of<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:39.890> trap<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.190> way<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.460> have<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.670> best

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
of the trap that way I have the best

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.580 
of the trap that way I have the best
possible<00:03:41.300> chance<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.600> surviving<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.500> you

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
possible chance of surviving so you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.230 
possible chance of surviving so you
always<00:03:42.830> sort<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.310> want<00:03:43.490> to<00:03:43.550> know<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:43.910> if<00:03:44.090> I

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
always sort of want to know that if I

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.880 
always sort of want to know that if I
take<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> zombies<00:03:44.810> here<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.290> kill<00:03:45.530> them<00:03:45.710> I

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
take the zombies here and I kill them I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.200 
take the zombies here and I kill them I
might<00:03:46.460> be<00:03:46.640> screwed<00:03:46.910> because<00:03:46.970> I'll<00:03:47.150> have

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
might be screwed because I'll have

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.430 
might be screwed because I'll have
enough<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.720> get<00:03:47.810> back<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.960> my<00:03:48.110> location

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
enough time to get back to my location

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.050 
enough time to get back to my location
so<00:03:48.770> always<00:03:49.040> kill<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.400> zombies<00:03:49.760> when<00:03:49.940> it's

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
so always kill the zombies when it's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.150 
so always kill the zombies when it's
best<00:03:50.270> for<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.720> don't<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.560> kill<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:51.830> zombies

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
best for you don't just kill the zombies

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.860 
best for you don't just kill the zombies
because<00:03:52.370> Yolo<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.150> know<00:03:53.360> sometimes<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.810> do

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
because Yolo you know sometimes I do

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.330 
because Yolo you know sometimes I do
always<00:03:54.080> do<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.410> because<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.710> mean<00:03:54.920> why<00:03:55.160> not

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
always do that because I mean why not

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.250 
always do that because I mean why not
Yolo<00:03:55.730> man<00:03:55.880> but<00:03:56.360> still<00:03:56.600> always<00:03:56.870> kill<00:03:57.200> the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
Yolo man but still always kill the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.480 
Yolo man but still always kill the
zombies<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.710> best<00:03:57.950> possible<00:03:58.370> location

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
zombies in the best possible location

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.030 
zombies in the best possible location
for<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.780> means<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.260> place<00:04:00.740> where<00:04:00.950> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
for you and that means a place where you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710 
for you and that means a place where you
can<00:04:01.220> easily<00:04:01.460> train<00:04:01.910> them<00:04:02.060> back<00:04:02.210> up<00:04:02.420> where<00:04:02.630> you

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
can easily train them back up where you

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.120 
can easily train them back up where you
place<00:04:02.960> where<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.140> can<00:04:03.260> easily<00:04:03.500> get<00:04:03.770> back<00:04:03.950> to

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
place where you can easily get back to

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.440 
place where you can easily get back to
your<00:04:04.220> location<00:04:04.730> where<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:04.940> are<00:04:05.000> gonna<00:04:05.150> train

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
your location where you are gonna train

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.060 
your location where you are gonna train
so<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.260> way<00:04:06.320> there's<00:04:06.530> less<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.770> chance<00:04:06.950> of

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
so that way there's less of a chance of

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.470 
so that way there's less of a chance of
zombies<00:04:07.520> cutting<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.820> off<00:04:07.850> or<00:04:08.180> less<00:04:08.330> of<00:04:08.450> a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
zombies cutting you off or less of a

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240 
zombies cutting you off or less of a
chance<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.290> running<00:04:09.560> somewhere<00:04:09.920> we<00:04:10.070> just

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
chance of you running somewhere we just

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.860 
chance of you running somewhere we just
really<00:04:10.490> don't<00:04:10.760> know<00:04:11.000> or<00:04:11.210> you<00:04:11.510> really<00:04:11.690> don't

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
really don't know or you really don't

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.910 
really don't know or you really don't
know<00:04:11.960> what's<00:04:12.110> gonna<00:04:12.200> happen<00:04:12.530> next<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.860> don't

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.140 
know what's gonna happen next you don't

something like that always basically

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.110 
something like that always basically
where<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.799> train<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.400> another<00:04:22.820> thing<00:04:22.940> is

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
where you train it and another thing is

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.130

wherever you want to go but do not kill
them<00:05:32.570> during<00:05:33.020> this<00:05:33.140> because<00:05:33.350> if<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> do<00:05:33.800> let's

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
them during this because if you do let's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.680 
them during this because if you do let's
start<00:05:34.760> spawning<00:05:34.970> in<00:05:35.210> ahead<00:05:35.390> of<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.570> and

start spawning in ahead of you and
that's<00:05:35.840> not<00:05:35.930> something<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.260> want<00:05:36.350> because

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
that's not something you want because

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.050 
that's not something you want because
they<00:05:36.800> could<00:05:36.920> easily<00:05:36.950> trap<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.550> in<00:05:37.670> a<00:05:37.730> corner

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
they could easily trap you in a corner

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.490
