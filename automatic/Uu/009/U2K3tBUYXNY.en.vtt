incredible finisher on this game Hulk
and<00:01:40.439> Willian<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.860> well<00:01:41.040> two<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.729> solid

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
and Willian as well two very solid
players<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.380> well-rounded

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

squad<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:45.119> tend<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:46.079> with

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
squad I don't tend to do very well with

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.710 
squad I don't tend to do very well with
teams<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.579> striker<00:01:47.939> but

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
teams which just have one striker but

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
teams which just have one striker but
we'll<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.520> skip

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
we'll see how we get on i will now skip

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
we'll see how we get on i will now skip
forward<00:01:51.210> until<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> find<00:01:52.140> myself<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.860> opponent

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
forward until I find myself an opponent

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.420 
forward until I find myself an opponent
okay<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.390> found<00:01:54.810> someone<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.979> looks<00:01:56.250> as

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
okay have we found someone it looks as

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.270 
okay have we found someone it looks as
though<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.110> let's<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.799> playing

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
though we have let's just get playing

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580 
though we have let's just get playing
shall<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.450> dark<00:02:00.719> kit<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.140> yours<00:02:01.350> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
shall we use that dark kit of yours that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.760 
shall we use that dark kit of yours that
is<00:02:02.130> nice<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:04.350> squad<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.680> he

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
is nice one right so what squad has he

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
is nice one right so what squad has he
got<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.219> did<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> lack<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> chemistry<00:02:06.570> there

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
got I did see a lack of chemistry there

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
got I did see a lack of chemistry there
which<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> always<00:02:07.439> useful<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> guess<00:02:08.520> guess

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
which is always useful but I guess guess

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
which is always useful but I guess guess
he's<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.090> okay<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:09.989> he's<00:02:10.259> been<00:02:10.440> open<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
he's just okay so he's been open in a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.170 
he's just okay so he's been open in a
couple<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.280> packs<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.910> he's<00:02:12.030> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
couple of packs and I think he's just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.020 
couple of packs and I think he's just
put<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> squad<00:02:12.810> together<00:02:12.989> really

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
put a squad together really

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.080 
put a squad together really
Pappy<00:02:15.030> cisse<00:02:15.570> kahlua<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.560> dead<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.670> failure

Pappy cisse kahlua from dead of failure

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.450 
Pappy cisse kahlua from dead of failure
he<00:02:18.300> could<00:02:18.330> probably<00:02:18.600> be<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.310> difficult<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.340> for

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
he could probably be a difficult one for

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.430 
he could probably be a difficult one for
me<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.820> handle<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.810> I've<00:02:21.930> come<00:02:22.380> up

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.540 
save really crazy safe kept me in the
game<00:02:54.180> there<00:02:55.070> right<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:58.040> plan<00:02:59.040> would<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
game there right so a plan would be to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.630 
game there right so a plan would be to
put<00:02:59.700> myself<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.420> high<00:03:00.660> pressure<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.280> then

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
put myself on high pressure and then

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.710 
put myself on high pressure and then
work<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.870> way<00:03:04.020> around<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.590> way<00:03:05.570> all<00:03:06.570> right

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
work the way around that way all right

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.750 
work the way around that way all right
now<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:06.990> think<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.590> could<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.430> keep<00:03:08.580> this

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
now I think we could if we can keep this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.820 
now I think we could if we can keep this
in<00:03:09.050> we<00:03:10.050> could<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:11.480> hit<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.510> off<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
in we could be all right hit it off the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.590 
in we could be all right hit it off the
post<00:03:14.160> oh<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.900> foul<00:03:16.110> yeah<00:03:16.440> fair<00:03:16.830> enough

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600
