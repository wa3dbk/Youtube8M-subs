00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you sell 10000 then all of a sudden you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.250 
you sell 10000 then all of a sudden you

radically<00:02:07.710> changes<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> economy<00:02:09.149> usually<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
radically changes the economy usually to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.990 
radically changes the economy usually to

bring a product to market takes a year

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.040 
bring a product to market takes a year
and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.720> find<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then you have to find the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
and then you have to find the
manufacturer<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.130> Wester<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.970> it's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
manufacturer and then Wester and so it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.820 
manufacturer and then Wester and so it's
going<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> force<00:02:15.900> us<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.080> change<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> way<00:02:16.709> we

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
going to force us to change the way we

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.250 
going to force us to change the way we
think<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.640> only<00:02:17.670> buying<00:02:18.510> products<00:02:19.080> but

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
think about not only buying products but

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.780

something like $250 to get that part in

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170 
something like $250 to get that part in

this<00:02:37.739> could<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> scary<00:02:38.430> technology<00:02:39.000> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
this could be a scary technology for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.790 
this could be a scary technology for
some<00:02:39.330> companies<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.770> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
some companies because what does that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.949 
some companies because what does that
mean<00:02:41.070> for<00:02:41.370> seasons<00:02:41.820> now<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.660> infinite

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
mean for seasons now you have infinite

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
mean for seasons now you have infinite
inventory<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.040> what<00:02:44.250> does<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.400> mean<00:02:44.670> for

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
inventory and what does it mean for

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180 
inventory and what does it mean for
scarcity<00:02:45.959> which<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> one<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> core<00:02:46.830> tenets

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
scarcity which is one of the core tenets

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
scarcity which is one of the core tenets
of<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.700> many<00:02:47.910> industries<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> very

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
of so many industries I think it's very

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.560 
of so many industries I think it's very
similar<00:02:50.220> though<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> social<00:02:50.910> media<00:02:51.180> or<00:02:51.360> other

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
similar though to social media or other

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.509 
similar though to social media or other
tools<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.230> engagement<00:02:52.380> where<00:02:52.920> you're<00:02:53.250> afraid

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
tools of engagement where you're afraid

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.280 
tools of engagement where you're afraid
to<00:02:53.910> see<00:02:54.330> what<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.600> would<00:02:54.690> mean<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.140> let

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
to see what that would mean to let

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.530 
to see what that would mean to let
consumers<00:02:55.440> cook<00:02:56.040> great<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:57.000> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
consumers cook great with you or to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.150 
consumers cook great with you or to
really<00:02:57.750> rethink<00:02:58.080> your<00:02:58.650> traditional

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
really rethink your traditional

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.800 
really rethink your traditional
manufacturing<00:02:59.790> process<00:03:00.239> because<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.690> have

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
manufacturing process because you have

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.750 
manufacturing process because you have
so<00:03:00.959> many<00:03:01.049> middlemen<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.769> think<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.580> have

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so many middlemen I think we just have

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.479 
so many middlemen I think we just have
to<00:03:02.850> stop<00:03:03.060> thinking<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.870> need<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.260> reach

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
to stop thinking that you need to reach

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.800 
to stop thinking that you need to reach
100,000<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> million<00:03:05.820> people<00:03:06.209> for<00:03:06.540> something

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
100,000 a million people for something

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.289

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.670 
to be successful customizations really
changing<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.900> way<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.470> think

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
changing the way that we have to think

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.180 
changing the way that we have to think
about<00:03:10.799> design<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
about design and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.530 
about design and
option<00:03:12.460> as<00:03:12.580> well

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.600 

people<00:03:16.540> who<00:03:16.840> make<00:03:17.260> money<00:03:17.469> by<00:03:17.709> selling<00:03:17.739> things

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
people who make money by selling things

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.250 
people who make money by selling things
that<00:03:19.000> are<00:03:19.120> all<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.359> sudden<00:03:19.659> easily<00:03:20.019> copy

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
that are all of a sudden easily copy

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.050 
that are all of a sudden easily copy
with<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> 3d<00:03:20.980> printer<00:03:21.370> are<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.879> to<00:03:21.939> be

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
with a 3d printer are going to be

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.190 
with a 3d printer are going to be
worried<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.450> people<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.959> going<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.109> be

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
worried that people are going to be

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.530 
worried that people are going to be
making<00:03:23.379> unauthorized<00:03:23.859> copies<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:25.150> those<00:03:25.299> 3d

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
making unauthorized copies with those 3d

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.849 
making unauthorized copies with those 3d
printers<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.170> think<00:03:26.409> one<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
printers and I think one of the

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.250 
printers and I think one of the
challenges<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:28.150> them<00:03:28.269> is<00:03:28.450> going<00:03:28.629> to<00:03:28.719> be<00:03:28.780> well

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
challenges for them is going to be well

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.349 
challenges for them is going to be well
how<00:03:29.319> do<00:03:29.379> I<00:03:29.500> react<00:03:29.829> objects<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.879> are<00:03:31.000> artistic

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
how do I react objects that are artistic

objects that are objects that you would

3d<00:03:57.639> printing<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.180> now<00:03:58.389> is<00:03:58.629> its<00:03:59.109> very

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
3d printing right now is its very

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.440 
3d printing right now is its very
beginnings<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.189> so<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.849> don't<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.239> lot

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
beginnings and so you don't have a lot

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.170 
beginnings and so you don't have a lot
of<00:04:01.540> case<00:04:01.750> law<00:04:01.780> about<00:04:02.439> everyday<00:04:03.159> people<00:04:03.700> making

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
people being able to do that on a large

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.319 
people being able to do that on a large
scale<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.379> good<00:04:11.739> thing<00:04:12.069> hopefully<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.970> that

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
scale the good thing hopefully is that

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.270 
scale the good thing hopefully is that
the<00:04:13.540> industries<00:04:14.049> that<00:04:14.079> are<00:04:14.230> disrupted<00:04:14.769> by<00:04:14.889> 3d

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
the industries that are disrupted by 3d

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.400 
the industries that are disrupted by 3d
printing<00:04:15.310> have<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.419> model<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.049> music

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
printing have the model of the music

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.620 
printing have the model of the music
industry<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:18.220> maybe<00:04:18.459> learn<00:04:18.699> from<00:04:19.030> music

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
industry to maybe learn from music

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.659 
industry to maybe learn from music
industry<00:04:20.019> when<00:04:20.289> someone<00:04:20.709> started<00:04:21.039> copying

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
industry when someone started copying

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.089 
industry when someone started copying
things<00:04:21.940> decided<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:22.690> best<00:04:22.900> thing<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.260> do<00:04:23.560> was

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
things decided the best thing to do was

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.710 
things decided the best thing to do was
take<00:04:24.400> their<00:04:24.639> time<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.150> their<00:04:25.270> money<00:04:25.300> and

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
take their time and their money and

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.659 
take their time and their money and
invest<00:04:26.289> it<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.560> suing<00:04:27.039> everyone<00:04:27.490> they<00:04:27.610> could

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
invest it in suing everyone they could

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.640 
invest it in suing everyone they could
find<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.330> try<00:04:28.599> and<00:04:28.720> stop<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.169> progress<00:04:29.380> of

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
find and try and stop the progress of

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.230 
find and try and stop the progress of
technology<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.550> didn't<00:04:30.760> work<00:04:30.909> very<00:04:30.940> well

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
technology that didn't work very well

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.360 
technology that didn't work very well
and<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.870> hope<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.680> these<00:04:32.919> creators

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
and so the hope is that these creators

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.189 
and so the hope is that these creators
when<00:04:33.699> they<00:04:33.789> see<00:04:33.849> this<00:04:34.120> new<00:04:34.180> technology<00:04:34.960> they

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
when they see this new technology they

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.659 
when they see this new technology they
capture<00:04:35.620> some<00:04:35.770> of<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.919> upside<00:04:36.280> they<00:04:36.460> say<00:04:36.639> oh

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
capture some of the upside they say oh

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.430 
capture some of the upside they say oh
wait<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.210> can<00:04:37.449> change<00:04:37.720> my<00:04:37.870> business<00:04:38.199> for<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
wait this can change my business for the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.350 
wait this can change my business for the
better<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.860> they<00:04:39.190> do<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.610> it's<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.090> hard

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
better and they do that it's a hard

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.210 
better and they do that it's a hard

can replace damaged vessels of the heart

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.650 
can replace damaged vessels of the heart
or<00:05:08.730> they're<00:05:09.000> gonna<00:05:09.090> be<00:05:09.210> able<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> print

in Japan there's a company that's taking

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.510 
in Japan there's a company that's taking
sonogram<00:05:30.960> down<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.650> they<00:05:31.770> scan<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.130> pregnant

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
sonogram down so they scan a pregnant

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.860 
sonogram down so they scan a pregnant
woman's<00:05:32.760> belly<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.450> they're<00:05:33.540> able<00:05:33.630> to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
woman's belly and they're able to

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.530

actually<00:05:34.080> 3d<00:05:34.770> print<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.280> figure<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.090> her<00:05:36.240> torso

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
actually 3d print a figure of her torso

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.450 
actually 3d print a figure of her torso
so<00:05:37.080> instead<00:05:37.350> of<00:05:37.410> just<00:05:37.560> having<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.890> fuzzy<00:05:38.280> little

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
so instead of just having a fuzzy little

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.040 
so instead of just having a fuzzy little
black-and-white<00:05:38.640> picture<00:05:39.240> you're<00:05:39.720> getting<00:05:39.960> a

thousands of years to build but what
these<00:05:57.510> scientists<00:05:57.960> do<00:05:58.080> is<00:05:58.290> they<00:05:58.440> find<00:05:58.770> the

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
these scientists do is they find the

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.500 
these scientists do is they find the
areas<00:05:59.190> that<00:05:59.220> are<00:05:59.400> damaged<00:05:59.790> they<00:06:00.030> make<00:06:00.240> CAD

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
areas that are damaged they make CAD

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.360 
areas that are damaged they make CAD
replicas<00:06:01.080> of<00:06:01.230> those<00:06:01.350> damaged<00:06:01.740> areas<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:02.280> they
