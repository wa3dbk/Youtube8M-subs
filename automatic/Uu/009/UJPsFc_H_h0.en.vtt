this time I'm gonna I'm gonna go with
the<00:01:57.320> vertical<00:01:57.710> concept<00:01:58.280> for<00:01:58.490> all<00:01:58.610> things<00:02:01.600> now

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
the vertical concept for all things now

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.540 
the vertical concept for all things now
imagine<00:02:03.710> you're<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:03.950> knowing<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.430> the

imagine you're not knowing what the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.600 
imagine you're not knowing what the
offense<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.060> doing<00:02:05.630> you're<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.290> defense<00:02:06.610> what

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
offense is doing you're on defense what

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.359 
offense is doing you're on defense what
I<00:02:07.640> would<00:02:07.880> do<00:02:08.350> first<00:02:09.350> adjustment<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.010> would<00:02:10.190> make

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
I would do first adjustment I would make

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.960 
I would do first adjustment I would make
I<00:02:10.760> will<00:02:11.330> bring<00:02:11.750> up<00:02:11.930> my<00:02:11.990> defensive<00:02:12.920> line<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
I will bring up my defensive line and I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.150 
I will bring up my defensive line and I
will<00:02:14.150> crash<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.660> toward<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:16.040> running<00:02:16.820> back

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
will crash them toward the running back

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.030 
will crash them toward the running back
also<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.459> will<00:02:20.300> come<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.810> take<00:02:20.990> my<00:02:21.200> nose<00:02:21.440> tackle

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040

and<00:02:22.220> put<00:02:22.640> him<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.060> QB<00:02:23.480> spy<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.400> would<00:02:25.400> adjust

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
and put him in a QB spy I would adjust

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.850 
and put him in a QB spy I would adjust
my<00:02:25.850> linebackers<00:02:26.510> again<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.110> spread<00:02:27.590> them<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
my linebackers again and spread them and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.310
