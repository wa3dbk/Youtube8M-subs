on these little side things right here
like<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.469> over<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:40.370> there's<00:00:41.370> a

figure<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.520> usually<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.120> should

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
figure in there but usually it should

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
figure in there but usually it should
fit<00:00:51.570> -<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> doesn't<00:00:52.699> then<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:53.820> little

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
fit - but it doesn't then these little

fit - but it doesn't then these little
type<00:00:54.300> things<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.960> shoot<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> they

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
type things they can shoot out and they

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.959 
type things they can shoot out and they
all<00:00:56.309> move<00:00:56.520> together<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.210> once<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.699> legs

are fully adjustable they rotate here

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.340 
are fully adjustable they rotate here
here<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.780> that's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> same<00:01:07.200> on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
here and up in there that's the same on

here and up in there that's the same on
all<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.680> them

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 

they<00:01:10.320> tend<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> fall<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.580> easy<00:01:11.820> our

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
they tend to fall off really easy our

they tend to fall off really easy our
slip<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:13.200> good<00:01:14.030> these<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> move<00:01:16.080> by

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
slip really good these make a move by

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
slip really good these make a move by
themselves<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.939> stiff

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
themselves a little stiff

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.249 
themselves a little stiff
I<00:01:18.630> could<00:01:18.990> shoot<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> either<00:01:19.500> -<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> also<00:01:21.960> the

I could shoot it either - and also the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.410 
I could shoot it either - and also the
electronics<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> switch<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.520> under<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it holds 20 figures 14 back here - on

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
it holds 20 figures 14 back here - on
the<00:01:46.650> Gunners<00:01:46.979> seat<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.690> then<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.200> rest

12<00:01:50.160> of<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.830> like

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
12 of them in here and it's got like

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.240 
12 of them in here and it's got like
these<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.460> um

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.690

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
if you hold it down the droid army is in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.539 
if you hold it down the droid army is in
full<00:02:37.260> retreat<00:02:42.590> that's<00:02:43.590> what<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.890> does<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
full retreat that's what it does for the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:58.880 
full retreat that's what it does for the
freezes<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.840> who's<00:02:46.110> walking

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.180 

okay<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.790> opens<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.830> can

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
okay and then this opens up and it can

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.400 
okay and then this opens up and it can
be<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:03.790> stairs<00:03:04.240> are<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.290> it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
be like a little stairs are you and it

be like a little stairs are you and it
holds<00:03:05.530> four<00:03:05.830> figures<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.520> each<00:03:06.610> other<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
holds four figures in each other like a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.790 
holds four figures in each other like a
little<00:03:07.300> screen<00:03:07.570> up<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:07.870> which<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.170> cool<00:03:08.440> and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
little screen up there which is cool and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.030 
little screen up there which is cool and
it's<00:03:09.250> got<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> Republic<00:03:09.880> symbol<00:03:10.240> that's<00:03:10.630> cool

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it's got a Republic symbol that's cool

and that's pretty much it with this it
holds<00:03:15.370> three<00:03:15.700> batteries<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.720> there<00:03:17.760> which<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
holds three batteries in there which is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.130 
holds three batteries in there which is
quite<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.660> lot<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:22.240> can<00:03:22.360> just<00:03:22.540> switch<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.870> off

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
quite a lot you can just switch it off

quite a lot you can just switch it off
if<00:03:23.410> you're<00:03:23.560> worried<00:03:23.890> about<00:03:24.330> battery<00:03:25.330> leakage
