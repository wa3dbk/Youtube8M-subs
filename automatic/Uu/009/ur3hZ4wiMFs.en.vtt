so<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.080> I'm<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.350> take<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> look<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.100> is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
so what I'm going to take a look at is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.850 
so what I'm going to take a look at is
I'm<00:02:16.940> going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> take<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> look<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.170> yoke<00:02:18.590> on

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
I'm going to take a look at the yoke on

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.780 
I'm going to take a look at the yoke on
my<00:02:19.280> bow<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.560> yoke<00:02:21.860> if<00:02:22.190> one<00:02:22.640> of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
my bow so here at the yoke if one of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
my bow so here at the yoke if one of
these<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.270> longer<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:23.930> shorter<00:02:23.959> than<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
these is longer or shorter than the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.759 
these is longer or shorter than the
other<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.519> cam<00:02:25.880> will<00:02:26.360> lean<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:27.500> direction

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
other the cam will lean in one direction

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.870 
other the cam will lean in one direction
or<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.340> other

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
or the other

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.780 
or the other
so<00:02:29.480> rather<00:02:29.810> than<00:02:29.989> visually<00:02:30.920> setting<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> cam

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
so rather than visually setting the cam

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.750 
so rather than visually setting the cam
dead<00:02:32.420> straight<00:02:33.019> at<00:02:33.230> rest<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.980> let<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.550> paper

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
dead straight at rest I let the paper

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.180 
dead straight at rest I let the paper
tear<00:02:35.150> tell<00:02:35.600> me<00:02:35.900> where<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.320> cam<00:02:36.560> needs<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.010> be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
tear tell me where the cam needs to be

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.570 
tear tell me where the cam needs to be
so<00:02:37.880> let's<00:02:38.060> run<00:02:38.239> over<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.720> my<00:02:38.989> power<00:02:39.890> press<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
so let's run over to my power press and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580 
so let's run over to my power press and
let's<00:02:40.790> take<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> look<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.380> put<00:02:42.560> a

let's take a look and I'm going to put a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.229 
let's take a look and I'm going to put a
couple<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.890> twists<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.489> yoke<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.180> I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
on this press I have a prototype of the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.340 
on this press I have a prototype of the
deluxe<00:02:54.910> second<00:02:55.910> axis<00:02:56.269> look<00:02:56.959> at<00:02:57.079> what<00:02:57.200> this

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
deluxe second axis look at what this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.530 
deluxe second axis look at what this
thing<00:02:57.590> will<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.890> when<00:02:58.670> I'm<00:02:58.820> working<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
thing will do when I'm working on the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.680 
thing will do when I'm working on the
bow<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.989> can<00:03:00.290> actually<00:03:00.470> tip<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.190> bow<00:03:01.370> down<00:03:01.760> so

left yoke to change the tilt of the cam
a<00:03:36.890> little<00:03:37.370> bit<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.760> get<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.000> string<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.540> little

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
a little bit to get the string a little

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.920 
a little bit to get the string a little
bit<00:03:38.989> more<00:03:39.200> behind<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> arrow<00:03:39.829> so<00:03:40.400> here<00:03:40.519> we<00:03:40.610> go

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
bit more behind the arrow so here we go

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.770 
bit more behind the arrow so here we go
put<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> little<00:03:43.170> press<00:03:43.439> in<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:44.750> make<00:03:45.750> sure

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
put a little press in there make sure

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.300 
put a little press in there make sure
that<00:03:46.170> I'm<00:03:46.290> turning<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:46.890> in<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.159> right

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
that I'm turning this in the right

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.860 
that I'm turning this in the right
direction<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> direction<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.750> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
direction and a direction that it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.920 
direction and a direction that it
tightens<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.489> now<00:03:50.760> I'm<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.299> twist<00:03:51.569> it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
tightens so now I'm going to twist it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.780 
tightens so now I'm going to twist it
and<00:03:52.250> then<00:03:53.250> put<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.640> back<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.879> there<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:58.790> put

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
and then put it back on there we go put

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.940 
and then put it back on there we go put
my<00:03:59.939> stabilizer<00:04:00.450> back<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.349> let's<00:04:01.650> see<00:04:01.799> how

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
my stabilizer back on and let's see how

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:20.060 
my stabilizer back on and let's see how
this<00:04:02.099> works

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.600 

okay<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.210> here<00:04:21.420> we<00:04:21.450> are<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:22.310> put<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> couple

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
okay so here we are I put a couple

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.840 
okay so here we are I put a couple
twists<00:04:24.180> in<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.540> yoke<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:26.070> looks<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.430> I

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
twists in the yoke and it looks like I

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.660 
twists in the yoke and it looks like I
went<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.660> little<00:04:28.380> bit<00:04:28.590> too<00:04:28.890> far<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.550> we

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
went just a little bit too far so we

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.800 
went just a little bit too far so we
went<00:04:29.880> from<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:31.380> here<00:04:32.000> with<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> few<00:04:33.360> twists

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
went from here to here with a few twists

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.450 
went from here to here with a few twists
in<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.080> yoke<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:34.590> now<00:04:35.010> I'm<00:04:35.070> going<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.280> back

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
in the yoke so now I'm going to back

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.910 
in the yoke so now I'm going to back
that<00:04:35.790> off<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> little<00:04:36.300> bit<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.960> then<00:04:37.200> that's

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
that off a little bit and then that's

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.400 
that off a little bit and then that's
going<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.220> perfect<00:04:38.700> so<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> couple<00:04:40.260> more

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
going to be perfect so a couple more

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.200 
going to be perfect so a couple more
things<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.040> should<00:04:41.340> think<00:04:41.370> about<00:04:41.760> while

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
things that you should think about while

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.610 
things that you should think about while
you're<00:04:42.510> shooting<00:04:42.750> through<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.110> paper<00:04:43.290> here's

you're shooting through the paper here's
a<00:04:43.680> couple<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:43.980> dumb<00:04:44.280> mistakes<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:44.910> I've<00:04:45.060> made

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
a couple of dumb mistakes that I've made

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.080 
a couple of dumb mistakes that I've made
in<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.480> past<00:04:45.750> like<00:04:46.530> I've<00:04:46.740> had<00:04:46.920> my<00:04:47.130> paper<00:04:47.490> too

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
in the past like I've had my paper too

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.390 
in the past like I've had my paper too
close<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> Bale<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.530> when<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.190> arrow

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.430 
close to the Bale and when the arrow
goes<00:04:50.820> through<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.420> paper<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.840> touches<00:04:52.290> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
goes through the paper it touches the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.090 
goes through the paper it touches the
Bale<00:04:52.680> before<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.380> fletchings<00:04:55.380> enter<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:55.950> that

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
Bale before the fletchings enter so that

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.130 
Bale before the fletchings enter so that
gave<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.340> weird<00:04:56.700> tear<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.300> adjusted<00:04:57.750> my<00:04:57.900> bow

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
gave a weird tear and I adjusted my bow

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.820 
all over the place trying to make it
tune<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.020> found<00:05:01.230> out<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.620> was<00:05:01.710> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
tune and it found out that it was the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.710 
tune and it found out that it was the
Bale<00:05:02.010> making<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.550> arrows<00:05:02.910> kick<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.450> don't<00:05:03.600> do

Bale making the arrows kick so don't do
that<00:05:04.100> another<00:05:05.100> one<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.550> if<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:05.910> get<00:05:06.060> a

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
that another one is if you get a

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.200

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
test shot through the paper and see if

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.110 
test shot through the paper and see if
that<00:05:36.900> hole<00:05:37.140> clears<00:05:37.590> up<00:05:37.860> for<00:05:38.160> you<00:05:38.280> that'll<00:05:38.970> let

chin<00:05:40.980> into<00:05:41.670> it<00:05:41.820> you'll<00:05:42.540> also<00:05:43.200> if<00:05:43.440> you're

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
chin into it you'll also if you're

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.320 
chin into it you'll also if you're
shooting<00:05:43.830> outdoors<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.610> have<00:05:44.880> kind<00:05:45.150> of<00:05:45.240> a

shooting outdoors and you have kind of a
football<00:05:45.870> shaped<00:05:46.320> group<00:05:46.710> it's<00:05:47.010> flat<00:05:47.310> in<00:05:47.430> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
football shaped group it's flat in the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.580 
football shaped group it's flat in the
middle<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:48.000> arrows<00:05:48.360> radiate<00:05:48.960> out<00:05:49.200> to<00:05:49.440> both

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
middle and arrows radiate out to both

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.550 
middle and arrows radiate out to both
sides<00:05:50.030> you're<00:05:51.030> also<00:05:51.180> getting<00:05:51.600> your<00:05:51.840> chin<00:05:52.200> or

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
sides you're also getting your chin or

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.310 
sides you're also getting your chin or
face<00:05:52.920> deflection<00:05:53.610> into<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.150> string<00:05:54.480> because

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
face deflection into the string because

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.830 
face deflection into the string because
that<00:05:55.620> makes<00:05:55.890> it<00:05:56.210> create<00:05:57.210> that<00:05:57.450> kind<00:05:57.720> of

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
that makes it create that kind of

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.320 
that makes it create that kind of
football<00:05:58.140> shape<00:05:58.770> or<00:05:59.100> flat<00:05:59.460> pattern

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
football shape or flat pattern

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.300 
football shape or flat pattern
move<00:06:00.509> the<00:06:00.659> target<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.319> be<00:06:01.530> aware<00:06:01.620> of<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:02.039> so

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
move the target so be aware of that so

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.950 
move the target so be aware of that so
I'm<00:06:02.699> going<00:06:02.819> to<00:06:02.879> take<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.120> twist<00:06:03.449> or<00:06:03.629> two<00:06:03.780> out<00:06:03.930> of

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
I'm going to take a twist or two out of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.659 
I'm going to take a twist or two out of
this<00:06:04.229> we're<00:06:04.800> going<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:04.949> get<00:06:05.039> it<00:06:05.159> to<00:06:05.280> a<00:06:05.310> bullet

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
this we're going to get it to a bullet

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.309 
this we're going to get it to a bullet
hole<00:06:05.819> and<00:06:06.150> then<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.389> get<00:06:06.569> to<00:06:06.599> go<00:06:06.689> outside<00:06:06.930> and

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
hole and then I get to go outside and

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:15.590 
hole and then I get to go outside and
sight<00:06:07.530> my<00:06:07.680> bow<00:06:07.860> in

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.290 

okay<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:16.320> we're<00:06:16.620> all<00:06:16.770> set<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:17.370> got<00:06:18.090> a<00:06:18.120> good

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
okay so we're all set I got a good

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.970 
okay so we're all set I got a good
bullet<00:06:18.480> hole<00:06:18.690> in<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.930> paper<00:06:19.110> now<00:06:19.710> this

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
bullet hole in the paper now this

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.220 
bullet hole in the paper now this
doesn't<00:06:20.280> mean<00:06:20.640> that<00:06:20.850> my<00:06:21.030> bow<00:06:21.300> is<00:06:21.510> perfectly

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
doesn't mean that my bow is perfectly

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.130 
doesn't mean that my bow is perfectly
tuned<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:23.520> means<00:06:23.910> that<00:06:24.270> I'm<00:06:24.390> ready<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.960> begin

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
tuned it means that I'm ready to begin

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.160 
tuned it means that I'm ready to begin
tuning<00:06:25.860> my<00:06:26.250> bow<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.330> what<00:06:27.660> a<00:06:27.690> bullet<00:06:27.990> hole

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
tuning my bow so what a bullet hole

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.200 
tuning my bow so what a bullet hole
really<00:06:28.560> means<00:06:28.830> through<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.190> paper<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.940> that

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
really means through the paper is that

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.210 
really means through the paper is that
means<00:06:30.450> that<00:06:30.720> yes<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.410> arrow<00:06:31.590> is<00:06:31.950> flying

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
means that yes the arrow is flying

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.670 
means that yes the arrow is flying
straight<00:06:32.550> through<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.060> bow<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.540> doesn't<00:06:34.440> mean

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
straight through the bow it doesn't mean

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.830 
straight through the bow it doesn't mean
that<00:06:34.710> it's<00:06:35.130> grouping<00:06:35.820> as<00:06:36.060> good<00:06:36.390> as<00:06:36.540> it<00:06:36.690> can

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
that it's grouping as good as it can

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.920 
that it's grouping as good as it can
possibly<00:06:36.900> group<00:06:37.890> so<00:06:38.610> I'll<00:06:38.760> go<00:06:39.060> outside<00:06:39.240> start

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
possibly group so I'll go outside start

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.660 
possibly group so I'll go outside start
doing<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.140> little<00:06:40.230> long-range<00:06:40.770> group<00:06:41.100> tuning

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
doing a little long-range group tuning

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.970 
doing a little long-range group tuning
I'll<00:06:41.940> do<00:06:42.120> a<00:06:42.150> Dudley<00:06:42.630> walk<00:06:42.840> back<00:06:43.140> I'll<00:06:43.560> do<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.740> few

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
I'll do a Dudley walk back I'll do a few

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740 
I'll do a Dudley walk back I'll do a few
other<00:06:44.160> things<00:06:44.490> to<00:06:44.730> make<00:06:44.910> sure<00:06:45.090> that<00:06:45.210> my<00:06:45.390> bow<00:06:45.570> is

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
other things to make sure that my bow is

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.030 
other things to make sure that my bow is
grouping<00:06:46.230> as<00:06:46.380> good<00:06:46.620> as<00:06:46.740> it<00:06:46.890> can<00:06:47.010> possibly

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
grouping as good as it can possibly

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.240 
grouping as good as it can possibly
group<00:06:47.780> so<00:06:48.780> keep<00:06:49.290> this<00:06:49.470> stuff<00:06:49.740> in<00:06:49.890> mind<00:06:50.100> the

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
group so keep this stuff in mind the

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.530 
group so keep this stuff in mind the
next<00:06:50.370> time<00:06:50.640> you're<00:06:50.760> trying<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.030> paper<00:06:51.240> tune

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
next time you're trying to paper tune

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.360 
next time you're trying to paper tune
your<00:06:51.690> bow<00:06:51.840> you<00:06:52.410> don't<00:06:52.620> have<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:52.920> kill<00:06:53.190> yourself

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
your bow you don't have to kill yourself

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.640 
your bow you don't have to kill yourself
to<00:06:53.760> get<00:06:53.940> a<00:06:53.970> perfect<00:06:54.420> bullet<00:06:54.690> hole<00:06:54.840> but<00:06:55.350> make<00:06:55.620> it

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
to get a perfect bullet hole but make it

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.890 
to get a perfect bullet hole but make it
look<00:06:55.830> pretty<00:06:56.490> good<00:06:56.760> before<00:06:57.030> you<00:06:57.360> start<00:06:57.660> and

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
look pretty good before you start and

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.870 
look pretty good before you start and
you'll<00:06:58.050> be<00:06:58.230> closer<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.950> a<00:06:58.980> perfect<00:06:59.400> tune<00:06:59.580> when

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
you'll be closer to a perfect tune when

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.190 
you'll be closer to a perfect tune when
you<00:07:00.000> start<00:07:00.270> getting<00:07:00.390> outside<00:07:00.840> and<00:07:01.050> group

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
you start getting outside and group

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.620 
you start getting outside and group
