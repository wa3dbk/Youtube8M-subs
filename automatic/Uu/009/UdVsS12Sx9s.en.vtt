00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello how are we all here in a 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.559
 new channel video and it's about a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.990
 performance test someone 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.430
 isolation on the video boards to md 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.710
 radeon 77 50 or r7 250 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.940
 very well first of all I loved you 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.770
 comment that this performance test 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.630
 it's going to be a little different from the others 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.670
 that we have been seeing in the channel because 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.510
 I 'm going to show you only two 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.260
 settings one with everything to the minimum and 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.450
 a resolution of 800 x 600 and one with 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.730
 everything to the maximum everything in ultra and activated 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.350
 at 1080p 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.559
 because we're going to do it that good because 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 the game works both on both 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.350
 as with everything disabled and in a 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.130
 minimum resolution as in a resolution 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.649
 very high as it is 1080 and with everything in a 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.490
 try activated not attacked works very 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.590
 good in both qualities 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.450
 so well for the one who does not know the 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.630
 Other specifications of my pc are a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.300
 Intel Core i3 32 processor 46 gigabytes 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.570
 ram memory 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.100
 well from these data we are going to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.730
 happen in what would be the proof of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.730
 performance 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.570
 very well let's start then with this 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.610
 performance test with everything to the minimum 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.430
 I put everything that is anti textures 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.740
 aliasing off shadows 3 activated 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.130
 all the minimum possible and one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.540
 resolution of 800 x 600 we will see 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.540
 now what is happening in the game 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.409
 well and as we see the game works 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.909
 perfectly the only thing that I have to them 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.149
 comment is that I could not record the data 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.520
 of my computer while playing by 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.100
 a question of what 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.810
 from full screen mode and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.629
 so that the pc data is recorded 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 you have to put it in window mode or 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.970
 in windows without borders then there I 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.319
 it seems I do not know you can not see the data 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.080
 on the screen but I kind of 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.500
 I comment that I play with everything to the minimum 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.349
 works at about 120 frames 120 frames 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.230
 are the average number of frames that 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.170
 reach this game with all the minimum and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.980
 a resolution of 800 x 600 equally 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.560
 as we see it looks pretty bad it looks very 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.290
 little defined very the textures look 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.940
 very blurry obviously you have some 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 barbarian saw edges because it is not 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.650
 activated the anti aliad without a 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.380
 very bad resolution but the game 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 it works perfectly then 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.380
 let's see what happens if 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.380
 We climbed all the possible 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.950
 very well and now what we are going to do 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.140
 we are going to put all the ultra everything to 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.409
 maximum this is going to be someone isolation 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.019
 to the maximum on this video plate with 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.620
 activated antialiasing textures activated 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.850
 shadows to the maximum all to the maximum and one 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.980
 Full HD 1080p resolution 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.310
 well and as we see the game works 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.140
 the same works perfectly you see a lot 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.100
 much better than the previous quality 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 obviously and the game even if you do not 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.490
 can see the data on the screen but I 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.950
 I tell you that the game in this quality 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.890
 it works at an average amount of 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.830
 frames of 30 just 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.959
 maybe at some point it arrives in some 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.390
 moment that you win on stage 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.660
 can go down to 25 but as 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.600
 minimum minimum 25 from there up goes to 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.920
 obviously that safe walking just as 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.020
 I always say it depends on the level of 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.610
 detail that there is at the moment is in the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.890
 scenario why the amount of front 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.480
 sometimes it's a bit relative and I do not know 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.330
 can say that a game will work 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.940
 so much frame because maybe it works for you 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.950
 30 frames at a moment later in another 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.000
 moment it works for you 10 it depends on the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.519
 level of detail in the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.180
 scenario and the textures load that 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.070
 have the election at this time 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.320
 but good as you see the game you can 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.900
 perfectly play perhaps the graphics 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.390
 in general they are not the best they are not 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.580
 of the games that most appear in 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.370
 graphics also has very nice 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.370
 textures and others quite softened very 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.080
 all right 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.350
 but the game works perfectly 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.350
 both in low and in ultra works 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.350
 Excellent 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.210
 to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.030
 very well and that has been all of the test 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.710
 of someone's performance isolation 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.380
 performance test a little shorter 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.770
 what 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.340
 facts regarding the previous 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.930
 this I wanted to do not join them this 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.960
 I play with others as I come doing 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.490
 when they are all in ultra because 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.790
 being a game a little more 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.180
 new and others preferred to do it alone 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.490
 and make it an individual video for this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.590
 video game so 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.289
 as I said before the game can be played 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.900
 perfectly so with everything to the minimum 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.610
 as with everything medium as high or as 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.069
 ultra or in all configurations 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.340
 possible the game works perfectly 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.590
 Obviously on bass have function at 120 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.740
 frames and high in ultra is going to 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.599
 work at 30 that the righteous what 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.620
 necessary for a game to be 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.430
 considered fluid 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.430
 so good 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.450
 another thing is that the game has 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.980
 normal graphics does not stand out maybe 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.290
 for the graphics by the fact that 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.910
 It is also an environment that does not 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.460
 help because it's a very closed environment 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.960
 very slightly darker than others 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.470
 games then maybe they do not get to 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.480
 show off all the graphic filters 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.520
 they propose us the truth but it is 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.410
 pretty good you can see pretty well 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.050
 and we are talking about a game very well 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.539
 optimized 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.720
 very well and saying this I hope that you 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.770
 I liked that you served them 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.490
 Any little thing they leave in the 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.159
 comments 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.659
 Any questions you have many thanks 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.659
 and see you in the next video
