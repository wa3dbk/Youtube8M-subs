00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.380
 eight guys here ederson hd 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.660
 today I am here with the fourth episode of 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.240
 ingenious construction traps 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.939
 today I will show you another door 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.960
 but it is sometimes like that of the centers 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.750
 commercial or fluent thing 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.700
 here and the structure is obviously flight 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.050
 blanket so that it won't be like that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.380
 great 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.880
 you will pass it will open 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.200
 and so of course we will need it for 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.200
 to be about to pass on both sides 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 well the structure will have to be owed 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.580
 have a space of three for 14 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.360
 simply and you digging dvd 2 c 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.259
 so this mechanism I will make you 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.460
 see later and nothing pass now 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.570
 to the construction of the door 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.719
 sliding then necessary for the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 construction will be material of the 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.799
 soil that you will take when the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.179
 you will remove dini you have no problems of 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:31.509
 at the plate for the pressure a 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.219
 sticky repeater repeaters 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.049
 piston to get material has 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.329
 detached pistons and red tom 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.429
 rex cakes is a material from 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.609
 construction I use the stone as you have 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.259
 seen in the final construction then 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:49.920
 velvet taking the material of the 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.369
 ground and do a massive t so 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 ok 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:00.729
 do the same thing on the other side not 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.429
 acts on the sides of t or internet 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.749
 like the torch of rexton and so careful 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.749
 you also do it on the other side 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.290
 this will serve to reverse the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.420
 mechanism you will now take the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.739
 building material in usa 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.370
 we like I could have given what 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.250
 want and cover these the burgundy is 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.310
 exactly like that and also from the other 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.310
 part 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 above the two extreme angles that is at the bottom 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.600
 right lower left top 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
 left top right 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.320
 You will put the torches of just jackson 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.760
 you will put them on you will see who will go out 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.410
 this will be the inverter of the mechanism 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 will also act in the same way between 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.770
 the other part with the torches you will have 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.790
 put under it well now go inside the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.250
 ditch 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.090
 put it down on one side and also 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 on the other two ex of rexton two cubes of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 rity 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.800
 put it runs peter is a repeater done 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.740
 be what other part 22 a repeater is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.960
 a leicester and symmetrical repeater that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.400
 will be the same in fans in both 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.770
 good directions this will obviously serve 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 for the symmetry with connected to 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.520
 torches say now 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:24.810
 cover above remember leave 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.420
 leaving out the two in half exactly 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.410
 two cubes in half that we will also discover 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.710
 those but at the beginning left there for 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.270
 allow us hare on plate 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:43.440
 ok so you need pure tetes 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.970
 cubes then put them at the plate and said 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.640
 when I will pass on to the reader 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.290
 cd reds will not activate on one side and 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.980
 other once this is done 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.540
 mechanism you will put whose omit the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.220
 glass moves face while the one with the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.650
 note the stone of the user's cubes thus 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.600
 then you will take the pistons I would get that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 detached from 1 because they will lengthen 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.300
 thanks to the mechanism on one side and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.400
 on the other 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.299
 well now you will put a stock of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.350
 stone like that with the rexton cake 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.989
 you will see that it is activated only with risotto 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.800
 to activate the above will suffice 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.870
 put a cube that will act as a 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.210
 extension of connections in fact if 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.310
 I put a stone you see that yes 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.370
 you will prolong the same thing 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.330
 on the other side put the straight e 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.069
 put the stone on it and yes 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.960
 they will close the doors so if you open 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.889
 they will have nothing array because you will have to 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.159
 connect these with a riff iter e 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:55.979
 the ariston connecting it to the stones of 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:58.909
 below that end up connecting with the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.919
 bisotto stones once this is done 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:04.830
 then you will pass on the rest they will open 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.080
 at the two doors and it will be your door 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.060
 sliding then you can of course 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.030
 cover it like I did before in 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.530
 structure and you're done 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.050
 you will only need a little space but the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.819
 mechanism is not pending complicated the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.129
 video I liked left a nice me 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:23.330
 like a comment sign up for the channel 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.330
 and see you next
