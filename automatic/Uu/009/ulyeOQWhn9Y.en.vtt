00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
think that's the main thing in um I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.139 
think that's the main thing in um I
think<00:01:16.470> he'll<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.799> fine<00:01:16.970> what<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.090> think

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
think he'll do fine what do you think

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.789 
think he'll do fine what do you think
about<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> track<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> far<00:01:18.990> you've<00:01:19.649> had<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
about the track so far you've had a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
about the track so far you've had a
chance<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> walk<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.060> come<00:01:21.420> back

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
chance to walk it here you come back

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
chance to walk it here you come back
it's<00:01:21.840> probably<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> wildest<00:01:22.860> ones

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's probably one of the wildest ones

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
it's probably one of the wildest ones
with<00:01:23.280> travis<00:01:23.670> Pastrana<00:01:24.090> designing<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> yes<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
with travis Pastrana designing it yes it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
with travis Pastrana designing it yes it
is<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> looks<00:01:26.040> pretty<00:01:26.159> technical<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.420> think

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is it looks pretty technical but I think

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
is it looks pretty technical but I think
the<00:01:28.259> more<00:01:28.619> technical<00:01:28.860> track<00:01:29.250> suit<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.640> style

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the more technical track suit my style

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.929 
the more technical track suit my style
better<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:31.219> there's<00:01:32.219> some<00:01:32.340> crazy<00:01:32.490> stuff<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
yeah um it's kind of worried about that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
yeah um it's kind of worried about that
everyone's<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.939> used<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.299> better

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
everyone's like I used so much better

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
everyone's like I used so much better
than<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.770> top<00:01:46.979> ten<00:01:47.189> guy

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
than that you can you can be top ten guy

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.190 
than that you can you can be top ten guy
and<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:48.299> been<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> while<00:01:48.659> since<00:01:48.810> I've<00:01:48.990> raced

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and it's been a while since I've raced

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
and it's been a while since I've raced
so<00:01:49.469> I<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.579> might<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:50.850> me<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:51.000> couple

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
so I think it might take me a couple
races<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.899> back<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.259> groove<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.920> yeah
