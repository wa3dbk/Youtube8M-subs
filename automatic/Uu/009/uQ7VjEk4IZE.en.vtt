00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.880
 Today I'm going to show you how to play the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.439
 the simplified version of the song and 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.930
 double guilherme santiago 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.300
 the song already starts with chorus and we 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.300
 we will have these chords is greater 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.239
 become smaller 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.170
 only greater 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.390

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.220

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 The rhythm that we go there to play this 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400
 music a simpler version of a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.979
 very common rhythm in the country music of 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.600
 root and on the viola wheels will stay 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:25.780
 so we'll play either down or 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 up 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.330

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.820

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.160

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.260
 Let's play it down and then stifle it. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:03.260
 sound with the right hand at the court there 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:07.840
 more so the first part 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.120

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:36.140

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.480
 did not stop the old confech serve 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.390
 God only knows how long I've cried. 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.090
 I suffered but I 'm not a thousand asking 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.599
 I have not seen anyone who does not leave the champion 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.579
 step that I want 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.170
 in the first part the rhythm is the same but 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.760
 we have a passage from the first part 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.750
 with the refrain that we're going to have a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.440
 variation 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.989
 Are you going to keep this here? They still do not want me. 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.989

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:27.019
 up down drowning down 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:29.060
 mute the sound with your right hand in the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.250
 part two we'll play the chorus and 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.620
 then climb through the music the chords 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.620

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:47.200

 You said that passion ends 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.020
 pace of passage to the second part is 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.720
 the same from the refrain for the first part 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.990
 Only now we're going to play down and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.580

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:40.360
