paid<00:01:35.100> off<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.520> well<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> should've<00:01:36.299> yeah<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.480 
paid off as well as it should've yeah I
definitely<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> overall<00:01:38.220> team

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
definitely think that the overall team

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.219 
definitely think that the overall team
comp<00:01:38.790> didn't<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> was

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
comp didn't really do what it was

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
comp didn't really do what it was
supposed<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.070> supposed<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> cut

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
but in all three of these games the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.140 
but in all three of these games the
underdogs<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:25.980> come<00:02:26.190> out<00:02:26.340> swinging<00:02:26.820> yeah

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.030 
our style on the world stage so now we
don't<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.170> improve<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.740> like

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
don't know what to improve so I like

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.380 
don't know what to improve so I like
that<00:02:56.220> they're<00:02:56.370> coming<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> getting<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
that they're coming out and getting the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.850 
that they're coming out and getting the
most<00:02:57.510> out<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.870> experience<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.710> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
most out of this experience and to that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.950 
most out of this experience and to that
end<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.370> my<00:02:59.550> opinion<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.450> closest

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
end in my opinion this was the closest

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.780 
end in my opinion this was the closest
game<00:03:01.230> we've<00:03:01.500> seen<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.100> far<00:03:02.130> which<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
game we've seen so far which is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.490 
game we've seen so far which is
interesting<00:03:03.660> considering<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.230> we're<00:03:04.380> all

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
interesting considering that we're all

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.130 
interesting considering that we're all
coming<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.130> probably<00:03:05.370> regarding<00:03:06.270> EDG<00:03:06.960> as

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
coming in here probably regarding EDG as

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.400 
coming in here probably regarding EDG as
the<00:03:07.620> team<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.160> beat<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.300> props<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.780> HQ

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the team to beat so you know props to HQ

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.500 
the team to beat so you know props to HQ
there<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.980> sticking<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.400> them<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.120> closely

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
there for sticking with them so closely

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.240 
there for sticking with them so closely
through<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> early<00:03:13.170> parts<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.770> game<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
through the early parts of this game I

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.830 
through the early parts of this game I
think<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> entire<00:03:15.150> turner<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> going

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
think that this entire turner is going

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.420 
think that this entire turner is going
to<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:15.990> closer<00:03:16.380> than<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.800> had<00:03:16.890> imagined<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
to be closer than we had imagined at the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.330 
to be closer than we had imagined at the
start<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.320> think<00:03:19.320> as<00:03:19.410> well<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.190> look

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
start I think as well that if you look

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.310 
start I think as well that if you look
right<00:03:20.490> now<00:03:20.640> at<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.850> metagame<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.780> diversity

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
right now at the metagame the diversity

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.170 
right now at the metagame the diversity
is<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:22.740> so<00:03:22.920> huge<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.280> everything<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.880> kind

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
is just so huge and everything is kind

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.840 
is just so huge and everything is kind
of<00:03:24.270> close<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.800> go<00:03:25.950> for<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.280> incumbents

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
of close so if you go for it incumbents

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850 
of close so if you go for it incumbents
less<00:03:27.600> punishing<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.260> less<00:03:28.410> snowball<00:03:28.830> II

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
less punishing and less snowball II

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.199 
less punishing and less snowball II
because<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.280> usually<00:03:29.459> don't<00:03:29.760> go<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.090> this

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
because you usually don't go for this

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.720 
because you usually don't go for this
double<00:03:31.020> assassin<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.190> instantly

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
double assassin that like instantly

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.990 
double assassin that like instantly
deletes<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.300> or<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.430> fail<00:03:35.430> or<00:03:35.760> like

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
deletes you or is like I fail or like

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.170 
deletes you or is like I fail or like
super<00:03:36.390> success<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.410> think<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.940> maybe<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
super success so I think that maybe the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180 
super success so I think that maybe the
meta<00:03:39.510> right<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:39.990> is<00:03:40.200> playing<00:03:40.650> into<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.010> favor

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
meta right now is playing into the favor

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.730 
meta right now is playing into the favor
of<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.760> know<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> lesser<00:03:42.330> teams<00:03:42.540> before<00:03:43.470> we

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
of you know the lesser teams before we

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.800 
of you know the lesser teams before we
get<00:03:43.920> into<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.490> rest<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.240> match<00:03:45.390> we<00:03:45.600> are

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
get into the rest of the match we are

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.480 
get into the rest of the match we are
going<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.170> send<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.470> over<00:03:46.770> to<00:03:46.800> shocks<00:03:47.190> who<00:03:47.400> is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
going to send it over to shocks who is

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.130 
going to send it over to shocks who is
