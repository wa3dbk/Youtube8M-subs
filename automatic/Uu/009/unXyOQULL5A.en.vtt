00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.860
 It was like selling everyone wanted 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.780
 in 2010, be in the museum of modern art 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.869
 at the retrospective of marina 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.430
 abramovic sat for eight months 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.730
 hours a day on a chair and 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.330
 switch people to 1500 people 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.830
 facing her and many were watching 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.240
 from where suddenly this interest 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.970
 performance art in the museum has the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.349
 art world enough of fetish objects the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.349
 only turning for the money 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 or is the performance the newest? 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 form of distraction in the saturated 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 art market 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 the promise of performance art 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 that you can talk about very simple and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 about gestures physical presence and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.719
 communicate about movement 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 We have experienced new virulence under 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 others, the means of communication 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.019
 nowadays that you have a lot of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.729
 that means to drive over the screens 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.030
 what the alive I have and that the 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.080
 immediate interaction new world 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 has experienced 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 It was not that long ago 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.360
 performance a marginal phenomenon of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.480
 art world 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.910
 now everything else is in the limelight 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.630
 this year's art basel were 14 rooms 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.700
 filled with live performance is the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.110
 encounter with real people stole the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.090
 sales object the show is this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.460
 transient art of a backlash 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 on the venality of almost everything 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 the market has to offer it's alright 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.510
 two points of discussion make a seat effective 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.729
 Performance signal of the criticism 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.430
 neoliberal practitioners metrum it differently 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.870
 makes the object of basic leave makes 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.940
 Group suite and that's for sure 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.950
 that performance is not yet the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.310
 has acceptance and in which they only on 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.350
 market has served the other way around 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 performance of course the world culture and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.390
 media society and social media 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.540
 Of course it's still so much 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 content is generated and there is widespread 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.820
 from the museum in hard as that yet 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.160
 the case is 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.500
 last weekend in the city as before 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.560
 Jenny is preparing for this year's event 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 sculpture exhibition in front of objects are 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 far and wide no one to see 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.740
 he commissioned the artist 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.820
 public space with performances too 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.750
 record the encounter between art 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.860
 and passant exciting and and totally too 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 to lead a confrontation 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.260
 the art of performance is one 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 mixture of minimal guests and im 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 crave for maximum attention 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.000
 tino sehgal the artist of 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.900
 attention and transience on 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.430
 the most radical is tino sehgal 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.010
 His works are basically just made 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.840
 Persons according to his instructions 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.840
 running talks and gestures at the museum 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.550
 even the guggenheim museum in new york 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.920
 was evacuated empty by fleeting segals 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.140
 to make room for encounters 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.209
 there is a ban on documentation because 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.209
 the art should exist only in the moment 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.500
 The Kunsthaus Zurich has a few 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
 years a work issued by sehgal 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.790
 and bought as no documentation 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:04:03.560
 The curators must be allowed to exist 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:04:07.850
 describe the work and and yourself 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.780
 introduces with name and a sport or 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.610
 question to the loss has with him or her 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.329
 about market economy question too 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:21.680
 save and rebuild that we do that 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:26.000
 that makes us in the end of that 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:32.090
 Speaker of the cashier of the museum and one 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.530
 Part of around when buying a segal 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.020
 Performance prevails special 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.190
 provisions no contracts only 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.190
 oral agreements 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.250
 meets with the artist with the 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:52.659
 court and everyone sees that buyer and 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:58.069
 sellers and trains and tino sehgal 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:59.990
 described the influence of the described 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.699
 kind of installation conditions ie who 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.439
 there must participate and then at the end 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:15.979
 there is a stop from a negotiation 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:17.779
 a radical innovator or ingenious 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.229
 sellers opinions go 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:22.550
 apart segals transient art 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.169
 is now selling too 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.759
 the volatile of the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.860
 performance seems to be in the 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.389
 to add to the market 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.110
 even though far from any gesture 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.110
 approaching
