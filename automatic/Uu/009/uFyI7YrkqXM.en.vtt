bookmarklet is essentially a normal
bookmark<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.889> contains<00:00:11.250> JavaScript<00:00:11.940> code

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
that can do some really cool things so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
that can do some really cool things so
let's<00:00:14.580> get<00:00:14.700> started<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.570> is

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
let's get started the first one is

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.330 
let's get started the first one is
asteroids<00:00:16.470> I'm<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
asteroids I'm going to do this on the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400 
asteroids I'm going to do this on the
normal<00:00:17.670> Google<00:00:18.180> page<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:18.900> essentially

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
normal Google page and I can essentially

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.189 
normal Google page and I can essentially
play<00:00:19.619> asteroids<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> page<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.330> gain

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
play asteroids with the page and gain

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.800 
play asteroids with the page and gain
points<00:00:22.439> from<00:00:22.910> taking<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.000> elements<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
points from taking out elements on the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.170 
points from taking out elements on the
page<00:00:24.990> normally<00:00:25.920> there<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> high<00:00:26.789> score

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
page normally there is a high score

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.730 
page normally there is a high score
shown<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> bottom<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.590> some

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
shown on the bottom right for some

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 
shown on the bottom right for some
reason<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> isn't<00:00:29.220> working<00:00:29.609> correctly<00:00:29.849> on

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
reason it isn't working correctly on

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.659 
reason it isn't working correctly on
this<00:00:30.810> page<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.070> submit<00:00:32.340> that

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
this page but you can then submit that

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.340 
this page but you can then submit that
high<00:00:32.820> school<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> their<00:00:33.420> global<00:00:33.660> database<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
high school to their global database of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.280 
high school to their global database of
scores<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.430> something<00:00:35.610> pretty<00:00:36.000> cool

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
scores so that's something pretty cool

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.569 
scores so that's something pretty cool
that's<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> first<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> second<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that's the first one the second one is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
that's the first one the second one is
the<00:00:39.030> font<00:00:39.480> bomb<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.680> page<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the font bomb so I've got my page here

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.900 
the font bomb so I've got my page here
where<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:41.899> googled<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.110> name<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:44.489> I'm

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
where I've googled my name and all I'm

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.459 
where I've googled my name and all I'm
going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.450> click<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
going to do is click now this is a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.240 
going to do is click now this is a
little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.860> laggy

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
little bit laggy

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
little bit laggy
because<00:00:47.670> I've<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.090> many<00:00:48.180> tabs<00:00:48.480> open<00:00:48.629> with

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
because I've got so many tabs open with

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
because I've got so many tabs open with
different<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.350> running<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
different things running but you can

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
different things running but you can
essentially<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.420> bomb<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> page<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
essentially just bomb the page and it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
essentially just bomb the page and it
will<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> text<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.120> see

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
will take the text out as you can see

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
will take the text out as you can see
there<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.129> running<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
there I do have a lot running at the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.360 
there I do have a lot running at the
moments<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.140> laggy<00:00:58.559> as

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
moments this was a little bit laggy as

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.560 
moments this was a little bit laggy as
you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.850> just<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.090> bit<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> an

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you can see it's just a little bit of an

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.209 
you can see it's just a little bit of an
experiment<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.379> something<00:01:01.649> fun<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> do

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
experiment there's something fun to do

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
experiment there's something fun to do
if<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.879> annoyed<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.359> something<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
if you're annoyed with something the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.820 
if you're annoyed with something the
next<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:06.390> katamari<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.560> may<00:01:07.710> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
next one is a katamari you may have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
next one is a katamari you may have
heard<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.400> before<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.119> says<00:01:09.510> background

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
heard this before it says background

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
heard this before it says background
music<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> doesn't<00:01:10.680> play<00:01:10.860> any<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.250> me<00:01:11.369> but

I<00:01:11.640> click<00:01:11.880> start<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.840> need<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
I click start and then we need to do is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780

hold<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.650> click<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> turns<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
hold the right click and it turns into a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
hold the right click and it turns into a
ball<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.180> gathers<00:01:15.570> stuff<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.710> goes

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
