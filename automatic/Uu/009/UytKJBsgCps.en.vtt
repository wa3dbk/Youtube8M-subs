crushers on this and the funny name to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
crushers on this and the funny name to
it<00:00:54.660> let's<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.520> crushed<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it let's go would get crushed if you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
it let's go would get crushed if you
don't<00:00:57.120> push<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> weight<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> suggest

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
don't push the weight up so I suggest

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.459 
don't push the weight up so I suggest
you<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.930> starting<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.350> with

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you do so so you know starting off with

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.039 
you do so so you know starting off with
a<00:01:01.559> pyramid<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.250> go

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
a pyramid I go like at first and then go

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
a pyramid I go like at first and then go
heavier<00:01:07.049> onwards<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.970> gets<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> pump

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
heavier onwards and that gets the pump

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
heavier onwards and that gets the pump
on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> outside<00:01:10.320> part<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:10.890> tricep<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
on the outside part in my tricep on the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
on the outside part in my tricep on the
stack<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.110> probably<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.740> three

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
stack it up to probably do about three

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
stack it up to probably do about three
plates<00:01:14.340> 30<00:01:14.670> kg<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.360> each<00:01:15.509> side<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:16.049> four

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
plates 30 kg on each side about four

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
plates 30 kg on each side about four
sets<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:17.009> 10<00:01:17.369> reps<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.869> done

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
sets of 10 reps and when I'm done

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.730 
sets of 10 reps and when I'm done
pumping<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.030> move<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.619> doing<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pumping on here I move on to doing the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
pumping on here I move on to doing the
cable<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.970> cable<00:01:24.000> has<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> handle<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cable the cable has got a handle on it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460 
cable the cable has got a handle on it
and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.540> position<00:01:28.259> my

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and the way I do this is I position my

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.030 
and the way I do this is I position my
elbow<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.310> my<00:01:29.340> midsections<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> stomach

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
elbow to my midsections on the stomach

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
elbow to my midsections on the stomach
so<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.520> focus<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.020> isolation<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
so that I can focus on that isolation of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
so that I can focus on that isolation of
the<00:01:35.009> inner<00:01:35.280> part<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:36.000> tricep<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.170> I'll<00:01:37.259> yank

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the inner part of my tricep so I'll yank

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
the inner part of my tricep so I'll yank
it<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> full<00:01:39.240> range<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it all the way down get a full range and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.800 
it all the way down get a full range and
pull<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.540> always<00:01:42.540> start

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
pull it all the way back up always start

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.179 
pull it all the way back up always start
with<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> pyramid<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> get

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
with a pyramid you don't want to get

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
with a pyramid you don't want to get
injured<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.299> always<00:01:45.420> wise<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> start<00:01:46.229> off

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
injured so it's always wise to start off

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.330 
injured so it's always wise to start off
like<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
like that you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
like that you
motion<00:01:47.820> first<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.960> moving<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.439> from

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
motion first and then moving on from

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
motion first and then moving on from
there<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.009> stack<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.719> could

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
there you stack it up more and you could

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
there you stack it up more and you could
be<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.200> adventurous<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.890> could<00:01:52.979> play<00:01:53.189> with

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
be more adventurous you could play with

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
be more adventurous you could play with
it<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.420> make<00:01:54.630> sure<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.740> working

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it but make sure that you are working

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.359 
it but make sure that you are working
hard<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.490> well<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:59.100> doing

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
hard as well and then probably doing

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.240 
hard as well and then probably doing
about<00:01:59.399> four<00:02:00.119> sets<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.569> those<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.409> ten

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
about four sets of those with about ten

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.510 
about four sets of those with about ten
reps<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:03.869> hitting<00:02:04.200> inside<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.679> tricep<00:02:05.310> I'll

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
reps that's hitting inside a tricep I'll

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.389 
reps that's hitting inside a tricep I'll
move<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.179> other<00:02:06.860> type<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> workout

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
move on to the other type of workout

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.750 
move on to the other type of workout
from<00:02:08.549> inside<00:02:09.500> tricep<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
from inside tricep what I do for this

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.720 
from inside tricep what I do for this
there's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> rope<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.950> put<00:02:14.129> on<00:02:14.190> cable

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
there's a rope that you can put on cable

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.770 
there's a rope that you can put on cable
and<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:16.080> actually<00:02:17.040> put<00:02:17.400> my<00:02:17.519> posterior<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and I actually put my posterior on the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.280 
and I actually put my posterior on the
in<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> ball<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:20.299> my<00:02:21.299> he'll<00:02:21.930> actually

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
in the ball and my he'll actually

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.580 
in the ball and my he'll actually
planted<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.579> it<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.849> well<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:25.200> way<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:25.470> it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
planted up on it as well the way I do it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.140 
planted up on it as well the way I do it
is<00:02:25.739> quite<00:02:25.980> different<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.519> what<00:02:26.700> people

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
is quite different to what people

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.920 
is quite different to what people
normally<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.420> focus<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.630> just

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
normally do because I focus on just

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.420 
normally do because I focus on just
isolated<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.069> actual<00:02:32.730> joint<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.680> level

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
isolated that actual joint at this level

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.210 
isolated that actual joint at this level
and<00:02:35.760> position<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.780> I'm<00:02:36.900> taking<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:37.769> normally

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and position that I'm taking so normally

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
and position that I'm taking so normally
people<00:02:38.519> would<00:02:38.549> yank<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.299> way<00:02:39.390> down<00:02:39.660> with

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
people would yank all the way down with

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
people would yank all the way down with
their<00:02:39.989> body<00:02:40.200> weight<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.769> they're<00:02:40.920> using<00:02:41.160> their

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
their body weight so they're using their

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.110 
their body weight so they're using their
body<00:02:41.489> weight<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.079> eliminate<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.230> process<00:02:43.739> by

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
body weight I eliminate that process by

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.940 
body weight I eliminate that process by
focusing<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:45.930> my<00:02:46.079> posterior<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
focusing on you put my posterior on the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.150 
focusing on you put my posterior on the
actual<00:02:47.220> bar<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:48.239> hair<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.739> plant<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:49.980> it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
actual bar and my hair of plant it on it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.210 
actual bar and my hair of plant it on it
as<00:02:50.280> well<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:51.000> helps<00:02:51.329> me<00:02:51.480> focus<00:02:51.690> more<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.590> just

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
as well it helps me focus more on just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
as well it helps me focus more on just
hit<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:53.760> inside<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.389> triceps<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.109> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
hit in the inside of my triceps so you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.259 
hit in the inside of my triceps so you
could<00:02:55.319> try<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.829> see<00:02:56.400> where<00:02:56.579> I<00:02:56.609> works<00:02:57.030> for

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
could try it out see where I works for

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.470 
could try it out see where I works for
you<00:02:58.310> know<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:02:59.489> trying<00:02:59.700> never<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.239> till<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you know I'm trying never know till you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.710 
you know I'm trying never know till you
try<00:03:00.569> right<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> moving<00:03:02.609> on<00:03:02.819> from<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.150> I'll

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
try right so moving on from that I'll

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.740 
try right so moving on from that I'll
probably<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.380> four<00:03:04.650> sets<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.069> those<00:03:05.750> we

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
probably do about four sets of those we

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.050 
probably do about four sets of those we
go<00:03:06.989> as<00:03:07.139> heavy<00:03:07.380> as<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.920> tell<00:03:08.730> when<00:03:08.940> you're

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
go as heavy as I can tell when you're

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.430 
go as heavy as I can tell when you're
trying<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.299> do<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.450> great<00:03:09.810> fighter<00:03:10.049> you're

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
trying to do and great fighter you're

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.050 
trying to do and great fighter you're
not<00:03:10.560> going<00:03:10.739> very<00:03:10.799> far<00:03:10.980> beyond<00:03:11.519> go

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
not going very far beyond go

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.199 
not going very far beyond go
so<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> put<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.290> stack<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.920> way<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.940> best

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
so I put it stack up the way to the best

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.880 
so I put it stack up the way to the best
that<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.849> get<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.000> pump<00:03:18.270> on<00:03:18.480> there

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
that I can and get that pump on there

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.580 
that I can and get that pump on there
and<00:03:19.890> when<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.280> done<00:03:20.310> doing<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:21.560> shake<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and when I'm done doing that shake it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.070 
and when I'm done doing that shake it
off<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> little<00:03:23.040> move<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.360> next<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
off a little move on to the next and the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.130 
off a little move on to the next and the
final<00:03:25.530> workout<00:03:25.920> from<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.220> tricep<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.959> this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
final workout from the tricep and this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.910 
final workout from the tricep and this
one<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:29.060> on<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> bench<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.860> as<00:03:31.860> a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
one is really on the bench and as a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.970 
one is really on the bench and as a
close<00:03:32.220> grip<00:03:32.580> bench<00:03:33.530> movement<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.739> it's<00:03:34.890> not

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
close grip bench movement so it's not

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.740 
close grip bench movement so it's not
actually<00:03:35.459> doing<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> chest<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
actually doing the chest you have a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.809 
actually doing the chest you have a
close<00:03:37.080> grip<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.560> bar<00:03:37.769> as<00:03:38.040> exactly<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
close grip on the bar as exactly as it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.780 
close grip on the bar as exactly as it
says<00:03:39.440> don't<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.130> sighs<00:03:41.400> you're<00:03:41.760> not

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
says don't be you know sighs you're not

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.430 
says don't be you know sighs you're not
doing<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.239> heavy<00:03:42.450> as<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:42.720> normally<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
doing as heavy as you normally do on the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.729 
doing as heavy as you normally do on the
chest<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:45.269> reason<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.019> because<00:03:46.200> you

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
chest the reason for this is because you

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
chest the reason for this is because you
don't<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.190> much<00:03:47.340> strength<00:03:48.260> with<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
don't have as much strength with this

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.990 
don't have as much strength with this
motion<00:03:49.830> as<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.250> would<00:03:50.430> do<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.850> had<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
motion as you would do it you had a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.080 
motion as you would do it you had a
wider<00:03:51.239> grip<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.739> focus<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.430> just<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.970> know

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
wider grip so focus on just you know

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.940 
wider grip so focus on just you know
making<00:03:54.360> sure<00:03:54.510> you're<00:03:54.900> doing<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.200> right<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
making sure you're doing it right and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.380 
making sure you're doing it right and
you're<00:03:56.100> feeling<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.730> as<00:03:56.910> best<00:03:57.120> as<00:03:57.360> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
you're feeling it as best as you

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
possibly can the start of light get used

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.080 
possibly can the start of light get used
to<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> motion<00:04:01.310> getting<00:04:02.310> close<00:04:02.519> grip<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.940> that

bottom and just keep on with that and
stack<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.739> up<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.370> feel<00:04:11.640> comfortable<00:04:11.910> with

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.029 
stack it up to you feel comfortable with
you<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.140> probably<00:04:13.410> doing<00:04:13.830> about<00:04:13.940> eight<00:04:14.940> reps

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
you know probably doing about eight reps

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.650 
you know probably doing about eight reps
but<00:04:17.039> don't<00:04:17.250> stop<00:04:17.459> at<00:04:17.640> eight<00:04:17.789> because<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.390> last

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
but don't stop at eight because the last

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.539 
but don't stop at eight because the last
couple<00:04:18.989> would<00:04:19.530> actually<00:04:19.950> be<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.310> ones

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
couple would actually be the ones

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.350 
couple would actually be the ones
account<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.510> make<00:04:21.690> sure<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.989> make<00:04:22.200> sure<00:04:22.410> they
