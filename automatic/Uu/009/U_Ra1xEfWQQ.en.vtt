working on the wrong leg well that's
because<00:02:53.100> well<00:02:53.610> when<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.240> was<00:02:54.420> first<00:02:54.600> learning

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
because well when I was first learning

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.350 
because well when I was first learning
how<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.350> swords<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.580> was

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
how to do swords in you know I was

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
how to do swords in you know I was
watching<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.959> computer<00:02:58.110> screen<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
watching that on a computer screen and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.830 
watching that on a computer screen and
they<00:02:59.490> would<00:02:59.640> turn<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.910> bull<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> bee<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
they would turn a bull or a bee and I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.390 
they would turn a bull or a bee and I
thought<00:03:01.050> no<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.680> were<00:03:01.770> turning<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.250> way

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
thought no they were turning one way

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.920 
thought no they were turning one way
with<00:03:02.550> their<00:03:02.700> own<00:03:02.820> obviously<00:03:03.209> turned<00:03:03.510> out<00:03:03.780> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
with their own obviously turned out of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.550 
with their own obviously turned out of
it<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.709> um<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.239> clear<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.630> out<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.410> um

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it so um just to clear that out but um

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.520 
it so um just to clear that out but um
so<00:03:08.400> there's<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.420> three<00:03:09.870> different<00:03:09.989> ways<00:03:10.380> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
so there's like three different ways to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.340 
so there's like three different ways to
pull<00:03:10.950> your<00:03:11.100> scorpion<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.790> needle<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:13.080> first

pull your scorpion and needle the first

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.699 
pull your scorpion and needle the first
way<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.830> do<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:15.320> put<00:03:16.320> your<00:03:16.500> foot

way you can do it is you put your foot

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.040 
way you can do it is you put your foot
up<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:17.190> sure<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.519> pointed<00:03:17.940> take<00:03:18.540> your<00:03:18.720> hand

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
what I usually do is I put this hand on

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.430 
what I usually do is I put this hand on
first<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.670> I'd<00:03:26.820> rather

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
first and then I'd rather

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.360 
first and then I'd rather
my<00:03:27.860> play<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.490> then<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.630> ring<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:34.190> it's

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
my play and then you ring it up and it's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.790 
my play and then you ring it up and it's
which<00:03:34.580> fits<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.270> then<00:03:36.200> make<00:03:36.380> sure<00:03:36.620> when

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.690 

I<00:04:59.250> find<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.120> lot<00:05:00.510> harder<00:05:00.870> because<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:02.580> like

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
I find a lot harder because it like

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.640 
I find a lot harder because it like
switching<00:05:03.180> your<00:05:03.330> grips<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.840> everything<00:05:04.290> so

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
switching your grips and everything so

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.860 
switching your grips and everything so
I'm<00:05:04.920> but<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> mean<00:05:05.700> when<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> was<00:05:06.360> first<00:05:06.630> learning

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
I'm but I mean when I was first learning

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.910 
I'm but I mean when I was first learning
how<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.140> do<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:07.380> that's<00:05:07.950> why<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.220> did<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
how to do it that's why I did so the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.900 
how to do it that's why I did so the
next<00:05:11.100> thing<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.400> don't<00:05:11.460> want<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.670> do<00:05:11.790> it

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
next thing you don't want to do it

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.110 
next thing you don't want to do it
longer<00:05:12.090> tackle<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:12.720> they<00:05:13.070> do<00:05:14.070> like<00:05:14.310> two<00:05:14.940> or

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
longer tackle so they do like two or

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:29.630 
longer tackle so they do like two or
three<00:05:15.150> skills

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.660 

the<00:05:30.640> second<00:05:31.120> scanner<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.540> do<00:05:31.720> try<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.640> do<00:05:33.640> a

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
the second scanner you do try to do a

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.780 
the second scanner you do try to do a
scale<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.420> then<00:05:34.900> push<00:05:35.290> it<00:05:35.530> like<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.670> can

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
scale and then push it like and you can

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.030 
scale and then push it like and you can
bounce<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.330> over<00:05:37.390> just<00:05:37.720> like<00:05:37.810> pulling<00:05:38.620> it<00:05:38.740> hold

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
bounce it over just like pulling it hold

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.500 
bounce it over just like pulling it hold
