00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.170

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.640
 you need it 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.930
 Hello everyone, you are Vika and now we are 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.210
 we will do with you 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.899
 day to north makeup 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 smokey ice as you see i have already eliminated 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.949
 color nuances on the face 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.409
 but it did not use the tone 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.399
 I already told you about this 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:05.420
 then I took a brush and 217 abundantly 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.690
 I apply and how you see the shades 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.940
 from mac he called skinton put it 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.750
 completely on all eyelid and a little bit 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.679
 by the way under the eyes to fix 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.679
 proofreader and concealer 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.159
 so on i will use my loved ones 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.360
 burberry shadows 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.520
 shades a 22 they are incredibly soft 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.509
 so easy to shade one 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 the pleasure of working with them on our self 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:45.460
 them as you see the sponge applicator 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 so the color is more saturated 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.149
 I think this makeup can rightly be called 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.990
 not even a boa condemn as in the main 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.030
 I'm the same and the amount taken is 5 then 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
 there are feather shadows which 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.640
 enveloping my eyes with a light haze so i 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 I put them on the lower eyelid so now 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.600
 noticed but why fiercely and because i 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.580
 without using traditional dark and bright 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.480
 makeup colors 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.480
 now 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.739
 now i will use pure 286 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.800
 fluffy brush from mac to shade 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.709
 the boundaries of our shade and get 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.780
 perfect haze 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.239
 everything looks very natural but also 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.880
 of this effect I am striving though if 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.800
 take a closer look and look closer then you 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.440
 You may notice how interesting 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.580
 shade these shadows berberine further 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.250
 turning from a palette mage and taking 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.100
 dark brown shades 217 brush but 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.160
 you don't necessarily need brothers exactly magician as 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:07.310
 you understand and highlight the crease and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.900
 little corner a little bit how to do something 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 Makeup is still a little brighter 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.880
 d 1 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.350
 will find 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.480
 also this dark brown shades 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.480
 need a little bit on the lower eyelid 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.300
 and now i'm again turning fluffy 286 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.340
 brushes and start to shade this 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.170
 times already dark shades that we 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.900
 put in a little corner and a little bit on 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.180
 lower eyelid as you understand the main thing in this 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 make up is a nice shading 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:20.050
 so shade and again 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.680
 shading now visually a little 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.020
 we lift our edges causing 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.710
 light white almost white shade 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.380
 the place where our brow curves 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.220
 Unfortunately, I did not show what shade 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.650
 I put on 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.190
 Well, I think it was from the dior palette 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.830
 just such an almost white shade 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.680
 Now I again take a successful palette from 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.030
 mac and brush on which i 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.240
 pre- sprayed retainer and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.670
 now I need to circle 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.120
 upper lash line fully and 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.610
 start a little bit on the lower eyelid 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.160
 Well, so that the line was not to attack 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 direct i mean i will apply and lightly 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.810
 tab shade in pace 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.350
 such a beautiful golden hue 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:19.020
 I put his thin 211 brush from 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.020
 mac in the inner corners of the eyes 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:30.440
 and now this is the golden shade of 217 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:34.320
 brush I will put on the center 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:41.280
 rolling century and it will give makeup 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:45.450
 some kind of volume and very very beautiful 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.700
 it looks something like this but I do n't even know 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.920
 as if I have been doing makeup for a very long time 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.280
 I know how all of this is poured 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.590
 plays but all this is quite restrained 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.830
 very nice very much like not 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.830
 defect 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.170
 all what you see looks pretty sti 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.620
 By the way, I used mascara from meykap 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.220
 time which is called your watch but also 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.220
 bye everyone
