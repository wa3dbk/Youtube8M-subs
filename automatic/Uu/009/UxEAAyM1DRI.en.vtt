photos<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.980> your<00:02:22.970> folders<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
photos and your folders so this is a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220 
photos and your folders so this is a
really<00:02:25.370> nice<00:02:25.670> way<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.540> be<00:02:26.660> able<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.930> do<00:02:27.050> that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
really nice way to be able to do that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.820 
really nice way to be able to do that
and<00:02:27.940> sometimes<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.060> takes<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.330> second<00:02:29.840> with<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and sometimes it takes a second with a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.550 
and sometimes it takes a second with a
certain<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:31.370> say<00:02:31.670> like<00:02:31.880> my<00:02:32.450> facebook<00:02:33.080> photos

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
certain one say like my facebook photos

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.050 
certain one say like my facebook photos
it'll<00:02:33.800> take<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.160> bit<00:02:34.340> longer<00:02:34.520> compared

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it'll take a little bit longer compared

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.030 
it'll take a little bit longer compared
to<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> ones<00:02:35.450> i<00:02:35.600> have<00:02:35.750> already<00:02:35.930> inside<00:02:36.290> just

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to the ones i have already inside just

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.920 
to the ones i have already inside just
because<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> simply<00:02:37.640> has<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.760> load<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.420> take

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
because it simply has to load and take

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.960 
because it simply has to load and take
them<00:02:39.110> off<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.620> web<00:02:39.950> page<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.520> kind<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.820> see

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
them off the web page and kind of see

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.230 
them off the web page and kind of see
them<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.610> sometimes<00:02:43.610> they<00:02:43.850> will<00:02:44.030> take<00:02:44.210> a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
them all so sometimes they will take a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.840 
them all so sometimes they will take a
little<00:02:44.360> bit<00:02:44.480> longer<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:44.990> they<00:02:45.140> are<00:02:45.350> online

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
little bit longer if they are online

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.700 
little bit longer if they are online
such<00:02:46.850> as<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.300> Facebook<00:02:47.780> wands<00:02:48.170> your<00:02:48.350> Picasso

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
such as the Facebook wands your Picasso

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.440 
such as the Facebook wands your Picasso
on<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.190> I'll<00:02:49.250> take<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.430> little<00:02:49.610> bit<00:02:49.790> longer<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
on so I'll take a little bit longer to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.080 
on so I'll take a little bit longer to
see<00:02:50.810> those<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.880> not<00:02:53.240> another<00:02:53.600> great<00:02:54.230> way<00:02:54.470> is

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
see those but not another great way is

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.180 
see those but not another great way is
you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.240> actually<00:02:56.270> see<00:02:56.590> what<00:02:57.590> different

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190

you can actually see what different
icons<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.570> can<00:02:59.750> see<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.050> that's<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
icons do so I can see that that's the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.130 
icons do so I can see that that's the
camera<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.100> this<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.300> thumbnail<00:03:02.720> view<00:03:02.960> so
