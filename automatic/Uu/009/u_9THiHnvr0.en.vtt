00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
had completely difficulties at this time

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
had completely difficulties at this time
because<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.350> others<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
because we have some some others to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
because we have some some others to
change<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.710> we<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.810> also<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
change but not so much we and also I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
change but not so much we and also I
have<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> good<00:01:11.400> memory<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have a good memory of much of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
have a good memory of much of
shallowness<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:13.590> vanished<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.189> we

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
shallowness much vanished because we

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
shallowness much vanished because we
were<00:01:14.580> together<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> board<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> Europe

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
were together in in the board of Europe

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
were together in in the board of Europe
and<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.390> good<00:01:18.390> moment<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:19.140> we

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and we have a good moment because we

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
and we have a good moment because we
have<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> view<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.549> different<00:01:21.000> about

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have a view was not so different about

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
have a view was not so different about
the<00:01:21.630> progress<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> basketball<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.159> think

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the progress of a basketball and I think

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
the progress of a basketball and I think
so<00:01:24.240> Li<00:01:24.360> Chen<00:01:24.600> Yin<00:01:24.750> boys<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.710> only<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so Li Chen Yin boys are not only just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
so Li Chen Yin boys are not only just
players<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.450> are<00:01:27.509> also<00:01:27.720> sinking<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
players they are also sinking for the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
players they are also sinking for the
future<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.549> our<00:01:29.729> sports<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> something

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
future of our sports and it's something

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.289 
future of our sports and it's something
very<00:01:31.110> important<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> us<00:01:32.040> last<00:01:32.670> European

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
very important for us last European

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.440 
very important for us last European
Championship<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.619> first<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.430> 24<00:01:36.210> teams

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Championship the first one with 24 teams

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.620 
Championship the first one with 24 teams
was<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> great<00:01:37.259> success<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:38.070> Lithuania<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.970> was

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
was a great success in Lithuania it was

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
was a great success in Lithuania it was
a<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:40.170> I'd<00:01:40.799> level<00:01:41.369> competition<00:01:42.000> maybe<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
a very I'd level competition maybe it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
a very I'd level competition maybe it
was<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> best<00:01:42.930> european<00:01:43.409> championship<00:01:44.070> ever

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
was the best european championship ever

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.590 
was the best european championship ever
and<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.369> Kenya<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> always<00:01:47.850> working<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and I think Kenya is always working on

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.370 
and I think Kenya is always working on
the<00:01:49.170> way<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.680> FIBA<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> benefit<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the way of FIBA and for the benefit of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.550 
the way of FIBA and for the benefit of
basketball<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.600> sell<00:01:55.140> working

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
basketball and they are not sell working

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.969 
basketball and they are not sell working
for<00:01:55.770> themselves<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.899> brought<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.200> very

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
for themselves but they brought a very

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.590 
for themselves but they brought a very
very<00:01:59.399> good<00:01:59.670> spirit<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.469> always<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600
