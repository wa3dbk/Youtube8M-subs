suave<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.269> an<00:04:06.389> actor<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:07.199> very

suave it but it is an actor it's very
rare<00:04:07.949> i<00:04:07.980> think<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.669> have<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.359> chance<00:04:09.690> to

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
rare i think that you have a chance to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.020 
rare i think that you have a chance to
be<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> part<00:04:10.229> of<00:04:10.409> something<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:11.519> like<00:04:11.909> the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
be a part of something like like the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.580 
be a part of something like like the
original<00:04:12.419> other<00:04:12.599> cats<00:04:12.870> which<00:04:13.049> become<00:04:13.379> so

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
original other cats which become so

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.670 
original other cats which become so
iconic<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.459> classic<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> be

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
iconic and so classic and and now to be

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.500 
iconic and so classic and and now to be
asked<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.099> do<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.370> new<00:04:17.609> one<00:04:17.820> on<00:04:17.849> twice<00:04:18.209> but

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
asked to do this new one on twice but

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.479 
asked to do this new one on twice but
last<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.409> it's<00:04:19.530> very<00:04:19.560> rare<00:04:19.919> for<00:04:19.949> an<00:04:20.220> actor
