00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
 Hello everyone, we are continuing igrunka 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.850
 play minecraft today 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.980
 will be just a translation and so get ready 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.049
 because today I will review the mod 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.580
 who made a very cool dude i don't 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.130
 I remember his name but I will give you a link 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.369
 Look at all this fashion 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.860
 Let's start with what this is 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.990
 this mod it represents then 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.640
 that he captivate greatly improves 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.680
 minecraft graphics, that is, if it is 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.230
 together with shaders experience raiders only 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.730
 raiders her dynamics will not stand 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.070
 it will be just a bomb and so this is grass 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.079
 now imagine now just imagine 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.970
 what will happen if you look at the meadow and 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.989
 here is a lot of good grass straight 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.520
 traced squares 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.950
 imagine what a beauty and so we go 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.630
 further yes here they are yellow flowers here 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850
 how they look and will look like 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.309
 natural dried up and distinguished from 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.070
 here of course there are fiesta small 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.009
 defects but this is minecraft remember those 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.670
 what we had and what now and so 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.350
 go ahead it's completely traced 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.479
 but in principle it is not much changed from 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.049
 the past is unflattering there was about 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:21.009
 there is a past such garbage where is she 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.319
 was and does not remember already in different is not in 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.209
 overall there is no longer only modified 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.579
 here are these dried tree saplings 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.679
 Now they are even so that's already looks 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.959
 here you can see how it all 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.399
 different so go ahead now 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:41.560
 the very beginning itself is what I do in general 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.719
 ofigel guys sorry that he has not yet 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.190
 wavers near shaders if pan and here 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.820
 so here 's the wind 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.310
 so here are 2 leaves so how damn good 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.700
 by the way the idea is to have all these all this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 I wanted to see there pancake 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.110
 Okay, so what does the rose look like now 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.110
 wahl 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.830
 watermelon see this watermelon he now is not 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.430
 square and he is now very good 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.310
 tree now pumpkin pumpkin she pumpkin she doesn't 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.590
 square crap it's real now 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.590
 pumpkin and not some poop 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 incomprehensible thing reed look neither 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 one pixel is not visible so small 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.070
 natural reed points 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.980
 no shit any go ahead and 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.320
 now you will see apple apple too 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.240
 changed look at it just 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.240
 look i'm not silent 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.440
 yes it was an apple now it will clean 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.800
 trees and now move on to the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.800
 cool so we cut down our gay mod and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.920
 take things like iron that is 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.390
 iron things i mean wait i forgot 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 on my own to give iron things 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:19.190
 I forgot so where is my iron and shelves 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:23.500
 everything is now not enough and now it is this 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.890
 and there is a real iron iron sword 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.660
 look at this here it is an iron sword 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.940
 no texture in my opinion with this 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.940
 compare then see how she 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.959
 traced such diagonal 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.860
 so square into one block 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.250
 incomprehensible valyukevich 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.890
 not even in one block to anyone right there wald 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.989
 it's just just a picker pickax that's pickaxe 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.980
 I 've seen such a texture pack somewhere. He even 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.870
 similar to very much to some shorter 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.489
 there was a kind there was such a texture pack but all 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.640
 Equally look really pickax is not it 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.049
 semblance is an ordinary pickaxe 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 that is, the ball will repeat again perhaps 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.970
 because I am very surprised very one of 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 probably my favorite mods you 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.829
 I will begin to play with him and 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.769
 so let's check it out 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.769
 kraftitsa then suddenly we were deceived here and 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.569
 Now let's check this body 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.180
 my iron 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.300
 iron flight iron pickaxe which 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.949
 constantly gave us and diamonds of which she 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:46.830
 we just did not give a check yes it 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.979
 it is on come here drew 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.110
 these do not get up until I make I also 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.150
 ever need you now 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.770
 sword check 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.530
 Damazhit he on 5 as and home before 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.319
 i.e. 4 strokes kills zombies not 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.050
 failures it's cool how how how beautiful 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.240
 still made a man to me just 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.729
 really like this mod in general this 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.270
 pretty much it almost 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:15.500
 that is how it is all for today I hope 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.180
 what dude can ever be 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.590
 this video will be watched by the one who created this 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.050
 mod and say and make it continue 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.300
 because I really want to see let's say 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.669
 see how cool it would be if 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.870
 made fine texture still say 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.330
 know what armor 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.530
 here would not be such here or 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.690
 let's say sand to 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.460
 uneven size spread when 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.259
 that is, the blocks were so sandy 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.650
 really not square here it was 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:47.219
 would be cool or let's say eggs were 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.469
 normal eggs and bang clippers so 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.599
 what with some with some twist 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.480
 Were not something that just women are not clear 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.220
 what 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.410
 bang bang right that and in general i wish fashion 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.450
