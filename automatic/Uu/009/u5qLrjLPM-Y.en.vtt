 I'll take the taxi to get them 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 porcelain tile developer 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.959
 for you to see how it takes the same 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:46.030
 process in search of love but also there 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:50.080
 the schemes turned out to have voted when everything 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 Some people happened to me there. 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.930
 he thought that with the woman's 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.310
 fortunately reached the point in our 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.930
 caprice we're getting 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.760
 get some things but there are things 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.390
 which unfortunately will not work, is that 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.440
 the boy when he did the acceptance column 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.959
 slab 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.830
 he ended up doing a 6 out of square 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.540
 that you saw here took a stone and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.440
 of deviation 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.769
 Only when I got here did I find b 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.630
 we played better we started with 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.670
 an internet stone 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.940
 there I was going going going going going 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.870
 going to another one, we recognize the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.549
 small 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.130
 Unfortunately we have no right 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.049
 hide here in the corner and put 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:49.470
 another wall was the same thing 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:49.470
 we put this stone was a record and it was 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.150
 renovated and built it did not start from 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.030
 zero and here no longer had much to 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.140
 're already strong framework only bellucci nadal 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.590
 footprint here so far give me so much later 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.560
 from here until it emits more in the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.330
 actor made of the egg 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.790
 there's better to explain to you 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.940
 would not be the second stone did well in 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.090
 half of the risk and on the other side it rises 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.109
 file there debut was very good 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.120
 unfortunately this person will want 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.620
 pull a good serve and better attack 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.400
 best defense and did not have to take a 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.630
 here and another said it is also 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.260
 kind of ugly, but until the closing 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:40.770
 after the floor well beyond the 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.310
 The worst is that we are caprichando the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.410
 anthem in the finishing of problems and also 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.840
 a partner to have certain is show space 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.520
 settings to play later to the new 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.250
 cool deli right 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:02.540
 only in general the bottle or two more 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:06.450
 inside is the record of the stone 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.570
 today we are going to put in this band that 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.460
 is doing all day on the ground and the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.750
 next video there they wanted to see 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.080
 then the service is ready to put everything 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.880
 this all results in the hypothesis that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.930
 people will be using the protocol is a 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.930
 very good team too 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:46.560
 we will be putting together a 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.780
 thing and people close to the stone 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:56.550
 that sense of unification that is a 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:06:00.889
 thing only had a wallpaper without 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.990
