00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.504
 Welcome to Part 3 of MuseScore in 10 Easy Steps: The basics of introducing notes 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 In the first lesson, we set up the main elements of our score with the Help of a New Score 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.771
 Today we will look at two different ways you can enter notes. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.904
 Before we start, we need to tell MuseScore where we want to start the introduction 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.836
 I will select the first stroke and press the letter N 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.771
 This tells MuseScore to enter the note input mode and the cursor is displayed, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.869
 just as in a word-processing document. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.369
 You can make sure you are in the input mode 

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.784
 as you look at the bottom right corner of the screen. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.905
 Then you have to choose the duration using the buttons above 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.869
 My first note is a quarter with a point 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.771
 so I will choose a quarter and then the point. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.605
 In order to create the note, I will click on the desired line of the penetration. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.302
 Perhaps you think this method is too slow 

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.918
 so let's look at the better method of introducing: 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.824
 Each time is numbered 1-9 

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:35.763
 If I had pressed a number 4 on the keypad, eighth note would be selected. 

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:38.433
 Figure 5 selects a quarter 

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:41.770
 Figure 6 chooses a half, and so on. 

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:48.180
 You can use both the numbers above the letters on the keyboard 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.770
 and those on the right side of the keyboard. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.460
 The next note I want to add is a quarter, so I will press digit 5, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.370
 and it remains to write the letter corresponding to the note 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100
 using the letters on the keyboard. 

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.570
 I need my Fa die, 

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:18.670
 but I will use only the letter F because the diasis is in the armature. 

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:23.410
 Then I will change to eight by pressing 4 and pressing E 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.640
 then back to quarter F die and eighth G. 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340
 I can continue to enter notes with the keyboard 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.570
 which is significantly faster than hitting the mouse. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 The selected duration remains until you change it, 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.240
 so to enter the quarter pass, I only have to select a quarter at the beginning of the phrase. 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.040
 If I make a mistake, there are a few things I can do: 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.270
 Above all, I can bring back the last action 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.800
 through the universal combination Ctrl + Z (or Cmd + Z on Mac) 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.270
 then re-enter the note 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.800
 Alternatively, if I have entered the wrong tone, 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 I can move the note up and down using the arrow keys on the keyboard 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070
 until it came to the right tone. 

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.940
 The next beat I want to put La over In the middle. 

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.540
 You will see that MuseScore automatically puts La under the stack, 

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.750
 because this is the closest La to the last note. 

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.920
 Instead of using the shift arrows with an octave step-by-step, 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.470
 I can jump with one octave at a time 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.490
 by pressing Ctrl and Strike Up (or Cmd and Strike Up on Mac). 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.730
 Then I can finish the phrase as before. 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.240
 So, let's negotiate the steps for introducing notes: 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 Step 1: Click on a stroke (or pause) where you want to start typing 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.640
 Step 2: Press N to enter "note input" 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.810
 Step 3: Select the length of the note using the keypad numbers 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.870
 and finally, Step 4: Write the letter matching the note again using the keyboard
