00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
we're going to get into is target the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.460 
we're going to get into is target the
target<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.240> second<00:02:27.690> favorite<00:02:27.810> place<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.580 
target is my second favorite place and
that's<00:02:28.950> probably<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.780> when<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.230> into

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
that's probably because when you go into

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
arranged and set up very nicely and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
arranged and set up very nicely and
they've<00:02:36.570> got<00:02:36.750> prices<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.380> very<00:02:37.740> similar

they've got prices that are very similar

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.670 
they've got prices that are very similar
to<00:02:38.340> Lego<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.239> they<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> deal<00:02:40.410> when

to Lego so when they do have a deal when
they<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> percent<00:02:41.670> off<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.840> real

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
they do have a percent off it's a real

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.650 
they do have a percent off it's a real
deal<00:02:43.410> remember<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:43.950> talked<00:02:44.160> about<00:02:44.280> MSRP<00:02:45.060> in
