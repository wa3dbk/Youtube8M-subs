00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.279
 because for how are their inclusion them 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.250
 I bring a new trick with which 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.110
 we can get any spanair of 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.630
 any monster that we want in 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.969
 minecraft this and good I do not know if 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.860
 remember a while ago I made a video 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.020
 where you can teach how to do these 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.789
 heads that as you can see no longer 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.769
 it works because then here were the 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.410
 monsters' heads all this were 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.810
 monsters and animal heads and here 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.990
 I had this magician who was a cupcake and 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.820
 two these since I do not remember this one but 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.800
 good as you can see this trick no longer 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.480
 it works so in honor of this trick 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.760
 that no longer works and that it is already 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.630
 dead this trick has already been in the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.580
 past 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.170
 pitifully I quite like this 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.480
 trick 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.039
 I created this what good does not look like 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.769
 so much I wanted to do it if something similar 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.379
 like in filita and everything but good was 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.839
 this is something similar he did in 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.219
 honor to what has already died and 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.839
 well with this I tell you we can do 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.909
 any spam or any other 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.680
 monster and all signs not this 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.479
 it is only the handle that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.939
 we require everything is only a command 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.950
 take it away I'll explain it to you and then if 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.110
 example that we have the magma that here 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.360
 we have the witch here we have the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.840
 of skeleton zombie this is the place 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.429
 This may be because linked to suppose 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.319
 and how can you see that this fear is 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.940
 up here we can also do it with 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.649
 he the one of the dragon for the people who 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.120
 interesting thing that I did not put it because I 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.550
 he was scared 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.970
 and here we have this 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.150
 the spider of the caves one of clippers and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.470
 well this works a lot this 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.990
 many times I wanted to do this but not 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.150
 I knew you can do this in 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.890
 handles without any mode and recently 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.500
 a subscriber called joshua 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.270
 thank you so much you told me about this 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.950
 trick thing they do is a while but 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.480
 I had never recorded it and then I do not know 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.670
 I liked it, I said, well, I have to 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.670
 record this shit this I tell you 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 we only require a command which 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.700
 is this is that good here as 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.250
 always the coordinates of where 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.620
 we want the block to remain, for example 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.470
 if here I put one we put to let the 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.330
 zero so that this row is left from 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.929
 for example if I want here where it says 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.700
 identity we put for example if for 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.310
 give an example 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.430
 We give done and we give to this lever 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.989
 had around here should appear the and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.370
 here is how you can see here it seems 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.140
 a sheep 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.239
 and well I do not say we can do this or 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.150
 any monster that we want for 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.540
 example if here again changed to the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.510
 of the man for example of sisters with 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.700
 capitals and everything well remember in that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 that we normally carry this and good 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.360
 I think we wrote it wrong as it was 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.490
 which is to sell more with the lesser evil 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.100
 here we are as you can see just that 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.440
 almost just right there's a good thunder 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.360
 you fuck since we have letterman 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.460
 I also tell them we can do the same 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.710
 with the dragon thing that now we do have 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.780
 that put the capital letter d of the dragon 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.920
 well but I say half a million zeal in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.720
 this world because he's going to do it 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.820
 shit I'm very sure then today 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.800
 we're going to try it in another world, do not be 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.940
 again with the gas this we can do 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.280
 also with gas 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 and gas and we give two here the gas appears 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.820
 only bad is that you can not have a 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.890
 hand I was looking for the way to 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.530
 people have hands but can not 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.720
 you only have to be able to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.550
 put in a specific place but not 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.710
 you can this money at hand for example 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.860
 if I give you here this clip the 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.330
 half already know when they say goodbye 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.220
 gives block that you are selecting in this 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.160
 case for example if right here of the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.290
 click in the middle this happens but here 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.750
 with him with that kind of blocks 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.500
 it works then we have to put it 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.690
 directly from 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.160
 in this way what is left directly 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.740
 on the floor and I tell you here is where 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.240
 we put the coordinates now that I was 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.330
 happens right now it's over 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.530
 can we are going to put some monster that 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.530
 we are going to put laws for example 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.159
 and I think I 'm not sure that it does 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.629
 can yes you can be like for example 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.209
 the egg and they make the leander egg 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.549
 dragon if you hit him with a piston he 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.760
 break you can not hold the females and 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.799
 pass it, I'm not sure if it's going to work 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.329
 well it does not work, see how nice 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.329
 Oh God, I'm shitting here 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.580
 well it seems that this can not push 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.520
 I did not remember that, well, this is not 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.990
 I know what else to explain more than this is 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.880
 obviously here I put a lot of 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.250
 torches because if they do not appear all 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.349
 the minutes down here make me shit and 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.419
 I would not like this I think this is 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.310
 basically all this the command is 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.190
 play here in the description then 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.440
 I say they only change the name 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.210
 respective to the monster they want or 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.250
 this for example let's put another one that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.039
 is he who put the magma that I think 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.849
 is this one you write the abbot line I think that 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:00.190
 it is lava with capital letter l and s 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.380
 also capitalized but that's the way it is 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.380
 michael line 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.929
 if we're already good I think this is 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.909
 basically everything so I'm going to leave 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:14.819
 this here please support if you want 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.889
 more of this kind of videos and they do that 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.719
 I like to dance a little and not bring 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.219
 typical they do not know I always have 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.039
 liked but this is a little different 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.019
 as I hope and pressures or not 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.809

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:30.839
 that supports and well this I will bring this 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:34.110

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.779
