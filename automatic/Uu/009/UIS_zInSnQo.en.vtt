3<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.990> let's<00:00:31.260> begin<00:00:31.470> by<00:00:31.740> assuming<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:33.090> no

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
3 so let's begin by assuming we have no

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
3 so let's begin by assuming we have no
friction<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.230> drag<00:00:34.469> forces<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.760> also

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
friction and drag forces and that's also

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.830 
friction and drag forces and that's also
suppose<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:37.079> Point<00:00:37.559> 1<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:38.600> velocity<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
suppose at Point 1 our velocity of the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.130 
suppose at Point 1 our velocity of the
car<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.410> zero<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.640> choose<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> ground<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
car is zero so we choose the ground to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
car is zero so we choose the ground to
have<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> height<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> zero<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.910> choose<00:00:45.180> point

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
have a height of zero we choose point

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
have a height of zero we choose point
two<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.379> 10<00:00:46.920> meters<00:00:47.219> above<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> ground<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
two to be 10 meters above the ground and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.470 
two to be 10 meters above the ground and
point<00:00:49.050> want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.710> 15<00:00:50.430> meters<00:00:50.789> above<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
point want to be 15 meters above the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.529 
point want to be 15 meters above the
ground<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:52.829> begin<00:00:53.039> by<00:00:53.399> calculating<00:00:53.730> our

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
ground so let's begin by calculating our

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.240 
ground so let's begin by calculating our
energies<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.469> point<00:00:55.860> 1<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:58.020> Point<00:00:58.620> 1<00:00:58.770> our

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
energies at point 1 so at Point 1 our

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.090 
energies at point 1 so at Point 1 our
object<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.030> zero<00:01:00.480> velocity<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
object has zero velocity and that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
object has zero velocity and that
basically<00:01:02.609> means<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.180> our<00:01:03.449> kinetic<00:01:03.930> energy

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
basically means that our kinetic energy

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
basically means that our kinetic energy
our<00:01:04.860> energy<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> motion<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.210> zero<00:01:06.510> joules

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
our energy of motion is zero joules

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.880 
our energy of motion is zero joules
because<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.979> velocity<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> zero<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:10.500> what

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
because our velocity is zero now what

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
because our velocity is zero now what
about<00:01:11.010> our<00:01:11.420> gravitational<00:01:12.420> potential<00:01:12.960> energy

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
about our gravitational potential energy

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770 
about our gravitational potential energy
well<00:01:13.979> gravitational<00:01:14.880> potential<00:01:15.390> energy

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
well gravitational potential energy

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.600 
well gravitational potential energy
depends<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> position<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> object

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
depends on the position of the object

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630 
depends on the position of the object
the<00:01:18.390> gravitational<00:01:19.170> constant<00:01:19.350> G<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the gravitational constant G and the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
the gravitational constant G and the
mass<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.330> object<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.530> given<00:01:22.950> by

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
mass of that object and that's given by

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
mass of that object and that's given by
this<00:01:23.159> formula<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> gravitational

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this formula so the gravitational

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
this formula so the gravitational
potential<00:01:25.890> energy<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.520> our<00:01:26.729> cart<00:01:27.150> point<00:01:27.509> 1<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
potential energy of our cart point 1 is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.429 
potential energy of our cart point 1 is
equal<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> M<00:01:28.619> times<00:01:28.950> G<00:01:29.130> times<00:01:29.549> H<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.900> plug<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
equal to M times G times H so we plug in

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
equal to M times G times H so we plug in
our<00:01:31.560> values<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:34.880> 294,000<00:01:35.880> joules<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
our values and we get 294,000 joules of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.140 
our values and we get 294,000 joules of
gravitational<00:01:37.439> potential<00:01:37.799> energy<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.880> all

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the energy at point one is stored in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
the energy at point one is stored in

point<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.490> subtract<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.880> from<00:02:19.210> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
point to subtract that from the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.440 
point to subtract that from the
gravitational<00:02:20.770> potential<00:02:21.580> energy<00:02:21.700> at<00:02:22.120> point

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
gravitational potential energy at point

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.080 
gravitational potential energy at point
one<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.590> will<00:02:23.860> give<00:02:24.160> us<00:02:24.190> how<00:02:24.790> much

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
one and that will give us how much

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.470 
one and that will give us how much
magnetic<00:02:25.720> energy<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.710> because

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
magnetic energy we have because

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.820 
magnetic energy we have because
gravitational<00:02:28.480> potential<00:02:28.990> energy<00:02:29.140> inter

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
gravitational potential energy inter

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.550 
gravitational potential energy inter
converts<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.760> kinetic<00:02:31.030> potential<00:02:31.990> energy<00:02:32.380> and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
converts to kinetic potential energy and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.870 
converts to kinetic potential energy and
vice<00:02:32.800> versa<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.880> gravitational

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
vice versa so the gravitational

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060 
vice versa so the gravitational

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.820 
potential energy at point two is equal
to<00:02:39.490> F<00:02:39.730> times<00:02:40.090> G<00:02:40.240> times<00:02:40.630> H<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.320> plug<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.710> our

196 thousand joules of energy so to find
the<00:02:49.390> kinetic<00:02:49.780> energy<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.410> point<00:02:50.710> two<00:02:50.980> we

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the kinetic energy at point two we

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.790 
the kinetic energy at point two we
simply<00:02:51.670> take<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.210> value<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.960> take<00:02:53.530> this

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
found at point two so it has this much

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.720

gravitational<00:03:07.630> potential<00:03:08.320> energy<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:09.040> when

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
gravitational potential energy now when

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.810 
gravitational potential energy now when
the<00:03:09.910> object<00:03:10.510> moves<00:03:10.620> from<00:03:11.620> point<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.790> point

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
the object moves from point one to point

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.410 
the object moves from point one to point
three<00:03:13.570> we<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:15.100> transformation<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
three we have a transformation a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.830 
three we have a transformation a
complete<00:03:16.990> transformation<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:18.340> energy<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.600> all

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
complete transformation of energy so all

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.199 
complete transformation of energy so all
the<00:03:20.110> gravitational<00:03:20.980> potential<00:03:21.550> energy<00:03:21.700> goes

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
the gravitational potential energy goes

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.500 
the gravitational potential energy goes
into<00:03:22.390> kinetic<00:03:23.320> energy<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.240> height

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
into kinetic energy because the height

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.920 
into kinetic energy because the height
at<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.990> point<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.620> zero<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.430> our

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
at this point is zero so our

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.990 
at this point is zero so our
gravitational<00:03:28.930> potential<00:03:29.560> energy<00:03:29.650> MGH<00:03:30.250> is

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
gravitational potential energy MGH is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.600 
gravitational potential energy MGH is
equal<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.750> zero<00:03:32.020> Dools<00:03:32.350> because<00:03:32.830> H<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.340> zero

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
equal to zero Dools because H is zero

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.510 
equal to zero Dools because H is zero
and<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.360> means<00:03:34.720> all<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.709> energy<00:03:36.220> goes

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
and so that means all the energy goes

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.180 
and so that means all the energy goes
into<00:03:36.940> our<00:03:37.540> kinetic<00:03:38.140> energy<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
into our kinetic energy of the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.210 
into our kinetic energy of the
roller-coaster<00:03:39.880> car<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:40.989> equal<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> this

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
roller-coaster car so it's equal to this

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.630 
roller-coaster car so it's equal to this
quantity<00:03:42.989> now<00:03:43.989> let's<00:03:44.709> suppose<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.370> want<00:03:45.580> to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
quantity now let's suppose we want to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.479 
quantity now let's suppose we want to
calculate<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.510> velocity<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.800> object<00:03:47.830> at

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
calculate the velocity of the object at

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.790 
calculate the velocity of the object at
point<00:03:48.880> three<00:03:49.000> well<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:50.080> simply<00:03:50.320> use<00:03:50.770> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
point three well we simply use the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.550 
point three well we simply use the
following<00:03:51.430> formula<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.570> we<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.110> said<00:03:53.350> all

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
following formula so we just said all

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.940 
following formula so we just said all
the<00:03:54.209> gravitational<00:03:55.209> potential<00:03:55.870> energy<00:03:56.290> has

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
the gravitational potential energy has

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.880 
the gravitational potential energy has
been<00:03:57.250> converted<00:03:57.850> into<00:03:58.360> kinetic<00:03:58.720> energy<00:03:59.530> so<00:03:59.739> we

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
been converted into kinetic energy so we

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.540 
been converted into kinetic energy so we
equate<00:04:00.280> these<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:01.570> cross<00:04:02.530> out<00:04:02.800> m/s<00:04:03.190> because

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
equate these we cross out m/s because

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.420 
equate these we cross out m/s because
they<00:04:03.730> appear<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:04.180> both<00:04:04.360> sides<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:05.620> solve<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.220> V

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
they appear in both sides we solve for V

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.640 
they appear in both sides we solve for V
and<00:04:06.760> we<00:04:06.910> get<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> following<00:04:07.720> formula<00:04:08.230> bilasa

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and we get the following formula bilasa

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.620 
and we get the following formula bilasa
T<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.010> equal<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.550> square<00:04:09.880> root<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.390> two

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.910 
T is equal to the square root of two

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
times G times H H our highest point is

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.140 
times G times H H our highest point is

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
15

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.229 
15
G<00:04:16.389> is<00:04:16.600> 9.8<00:04:17.560> we<00:04:17.859> take<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.280> square<00:04:18.430> root<00:04:18.850> after

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
G is 9.8 we take the square root after

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.600 
G is 9.8 we take the square root after
we<00:04:19.359> multiply<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.290> we<00:04:20.889> get<00:04:21.900> 17.1<00:04:23.190> m/s<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:24.310> this

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
we multiply and we get 17.1 m/s so this

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.740 
we multiply and we get 17.1 m/s so this
is<00:04:24.789> our<00:04:25.000> velocity<00:04:25.180> at<00:04:26.020> point<00:04:26.440> three
