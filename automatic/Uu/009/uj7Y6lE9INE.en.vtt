00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.670
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.260
 well oh before you panther 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.200
 disguised as an American 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.119
 tank destroyer m10 in the game this machine 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.950
 is a premium medium tank and 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.529
 located on the seventh level 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.260
 First, let's briefly analyze TH 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.650
 safety margin of our heroine 1300 hp 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.510
 weight almost 46 tons and a viewing radius of 350 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
 meters here it is worth noting very 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.070
 decent both for and 107 stock hp and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 mediocre review with dynamics all 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.329
 not bad in general potter to m10 accelerates 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.190
 like a regular panther namely not 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.079
 as fast as stable and 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.960
 surely all this thanks to the engine 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.149
 700 horsepower but you tank 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.100
 quite often the gun burns 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.989
 lovers of big alpha worth it right away 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 discard the option of buying this car 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 because we have seventy-five 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.100
 single- millimeter cannon 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.180
 135 units but she is very fast-firing and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.280
 quite accurate 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.289
 weak point of this tool is 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.149
 break through but we are not the most 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.250
 fast but still medium tank so 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.460
 Our inheritance is not a shootout with tons of t 8 forehead in 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 forehead 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.009
 namely shooting in the side and stern and only with 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.890
 this our little gun copes with vein 8 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.590
 degrees down and 20 up armor I would not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.300
 called her strong 85 millimeters in her forehead 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.610
 hardly even inclined 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.759
 difficulties in single-level machines but 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 eights will sew you anywhere 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.060
 equipment in the first two slots set 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.280
 drives and enlightened q &amp; a in 3 on your 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.319
 choice either ventilation or rammer 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.849
 also optics can be changed to horns 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.310
 It depends on your chosen style. 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.140
 perk games on your screen 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.240
 I propose to watch the fight throughout 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.459
 which we will learn about our history 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.280
 heroines talk about the abilities of panther 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.020
 m10 as a car headlight and of course we learn 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.020
 on her play well go 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.459
 as I said at the beginning of our video 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.549
 panther disguised as an American 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.200
 m10 sure but why was it done 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.730
 and the thing is that in the fall of forty 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.140
 fourth year the Germans planned 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.239
 offensive in the ardennes 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.100
 and on the eve of this operation it was decided 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.410
 arrange a number of diversion forces 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
 panzer brigade units n hyundai 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.730
 fad armed trophy 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.739
 American technology but necessary 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 number of vehicles failed to collect and 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.099
 therefore it was decided 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.170
 disguise panthers as American 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.160
 vulve and by the way this operation 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.160
 ended in failure 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.430
 So the Panther M10 as a farm machine from 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.860
 each fight for 100 for a thousand and a half 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.110
 damage you will take out 30 to 40 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.940
 thousand silver the more homework you are 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 accordingly make more money 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 get at the cost of a tank at five 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.330
 thousand seven hundred and fifty coins this is quite 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.730
 decent result but i wouldn't consider 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.070
 our heroine main farm machine 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.020
 after all with straight eighth level she doesn't 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.270
 to contend but if you want to get 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.730
 acceptable headlamps for little money then 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.740
 it is your obvious choice as for 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.450
 shells then armor piercing cheap all by 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.070
 one hundred and nine coins per shot and golda 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.930
 which by and large need only 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.260
 against eights well or armored 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.360
 sevens then its value is 2800 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.790
 coins for the projectile but not least 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.040
 on the panther m10 thanks to the new 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.230
 features of prem tanks which are 12 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.970
 September introduced wargaming you can 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.970
 quickly swing your German crew 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.050
 Panther M10 has a rather complicated 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.820
 but interesting gameplay and that supposedly 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.760
 the average tank is actually much more 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.620
 comfortable and efficient as fri-sau yes 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.480
 we have a decent dynamic but with my 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.430
 point of view it is better to use for 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.320
 changing positions they are for breakthroughs but also 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.860
 all that we usually do on 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.900
 st 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.600
 it's much better to trade your own 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.790
 Hepe already at the end of the battle, remember that the corps 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.140
 We are not a small dropped virtually no 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.450
 it means the most correct way 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.670
 realize our dfm shooting from long range and 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.410
 middle distance is best 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.420
 of course it turns out on open cards and 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.820
 where the way in good stead and will play 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.980
 veins and accuracy of guns in the city 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.630
 need to keep behind allies and 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.140
 try to help them keeping the enemy on 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.150
 harp 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:12.190
 it freely allows our 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:14.440
 hurricane rate Well 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.760
 it's time to sum up the background 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.520
 a large number of positive 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.380
 Panther M10 qualities such as accuracy 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.180
 rate of fire mobility is large 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.010
 stock hp good yield and 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.290
 maximum eighth level fights 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.419
 even such significant flaws as 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.150
 frequent fires and crit and suit of modules 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.520
 low breakthroughs and alpha just fade 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.740
 I think this tank is worthy of 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.210
 take place in the hangar can this 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.919
 machine not every day but under 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.230
 certain mood she can 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.000
 deliver a lot of fun on this 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.280
 me all subscribe to wot fan 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.390
 and led the company for your sake and was amazed 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.390
 see you in new videos 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.520
 but
