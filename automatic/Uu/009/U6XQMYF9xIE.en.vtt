00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
two weeks ago I do a work makeup look at

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.930 
two weeks ago I do a work makeup look at
how<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> red<00:00:06.180> lip<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.690> then<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.319> defined<00:00:08.069> eye<00:00:08.340> so

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
how to red lip and then a defined eye so

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.820 
how to red lip and then a defined eye so
I<00:00:08.970> understand<00:00:09.540> that's<00:00:09.719> not<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.349> everyone<00:00:10.650> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I understand that's not for everyone so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.230 
I understand that's not for everyone so
that's<00:00:11.130> why<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> came<00:00:11.550> up<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:12.000> look

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that's why I came up with this look

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.520 
that's why I came up with this look
which<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.450> much<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:12.990> natural<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
which is much more natural and

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.790 
which is much more natural and
understated<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.460> love<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.809> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.260> look<00:00:16.529> for

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
little dots and it gives the illusion of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:34.590 
little dots and it gives the illusion of
a<00:03:19.260> thicker<00:03:19.530> lash<00:03:19.890> line<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:21.299> more<00:03:21.720> lashes

at<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.520> end<00:03:46.780> which<00:03:47.780> reminds<00:03:48.110> me<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.350> a
