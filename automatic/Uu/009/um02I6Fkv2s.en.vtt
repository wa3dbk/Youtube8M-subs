00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 to Iceland was the first country to suffer 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.839
 the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 ask the monetary fund for help 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.330
 international and also the first to leave 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 of the crisis with numbers to make 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 European countries 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.830
 the professor of philosophy of usp 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 columnist of our newspaper here 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.420
 culture that is the adversary fact was the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 iceland with finland on the edge of the abyss 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.609
 economic and social 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 according to the lawyer recalls the council 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 constitutional kato in other gifts 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.559
 were bankers who controlled the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 political process and make parties 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.079
 puppets of a financial market 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 set is easy to select from the crisis 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.090
 and bankruptcy led to protests and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 changes the new constitution of iceland 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
 was drafted by a popular council 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 followed closely by social networks 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.829
 I feel a parliamentary law if 10% of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
 population manifests this desire when 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 Vladimir asks whether the experience 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 Iceland could be exported to the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 the rest of the world she replies I never 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 I have this type of case that way. 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950
 the proposals in the new 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 constitution deal with the common good 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 interest of all citizens 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 it is worth remembering that the crisis 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 2008 the banks of Iceland had 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.299
 debts that totaled 10 times the GDP 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.390
 country or the nationalization of the three largest 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.420
 banks helped Iceland was the first 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.610
 European Union to seek help from the IMF 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 since 1976 the economy has shrunk by almost 7% 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 in 2009 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.150
 since the end of 2010 the country has 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.090
 growing by an average of two and a half per 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.100
 cent per year with unemployment of 5 points 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 percentages and the ones that it was 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.140
 center-left which implemented 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.960
 debt restructuring and restructured 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.750
 put the economy on the example rails 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.659
 which according to him should be followed by 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 Spain to avoid evictions and protect 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.579
 the citizens 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.200
 willian touched pact he remembers that 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.849
 two decades ago 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.349
 Iceland has also committed the same 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.530
 mistakes of others without crisis banks 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.959
 encourage 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.700
 is a real estate boom and have begun to 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.819
 act in the foreign market 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.470
 spent more than they could and failed the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.440
 president olafur ragnar grimsson 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.600
 re-elected three times believes that 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.239
 Iceland left in front of neighbors 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.950
 because it understands that the crisis does not 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.160
 was only financial but also 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.459
 political and social participation 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.870
 was fundamental in the case of Iceland 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.690
 countries in crisis are currently 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.239
 crushing the will of the people and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.840
 example the austerity programs of the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.750
 greece spain and portugal which considers 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 wrong promoter who puts the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.000
 with respect to banks says that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.970
 have become the worshiped church 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.239
 omnipresent and indisputable 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.340
 he cites one of his celebrated phrases o 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.910
 country that has a strong financial system 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 is a country whose economy is bad because 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.440
 drains the best brains in the industry 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 productive economy for the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.660
 financial and psychological impact on the future 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.989
 grimsson is optimistic said the country 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.090
 blessed with natural resources has everything 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.880
 to attract companies from the areas of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.010
 science technology and entertainment in 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.680
 with good traffic 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.810
 We have election in Iceland on Saturday. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680
 that that the new parliament parliament 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.900
 27 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.060
 I just wanted to add something 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.880
 which seems quite symptomatic of the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.310
 specificity of the Irish outlet for 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.650
 For example, Iceland has 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.700
 which consisted of the following if you have 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.739
 a debt that is 110% above the value of 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.190
 your property that you would have worsened by 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.570
 debt your debt was forgiven 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.239
 simply by the year she disappeared 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.190
 by decree by decree or because 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.750
 It is assumed that a person who 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.820
 has 110 percent and a debt of this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 size can not recover 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.269
 there is no way to recover and it is not 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.350
 interesting for the state for example 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.420
 so talk 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.519
 The bank then you go pick us up 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.959
 70 where you ask the house will not be a 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.640
 consumer unless you can not 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.620
 heat up the economy 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.060
 thing for example Spain did then 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.130
 This you had all these famous 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.020
 eviction of people with 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.759
 walks more complete vulnerability then 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.639
 then it was a situation where 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.470
 What are the conditions for 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.419
 society to return to be a society 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.759
 which is capable of putting the economy in 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.830
 now this is not possible in a 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.580
 country like Iceland this income because 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.470
 is a smaller country - complex would then say 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.120
 this is more or less this is more or 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.669
 less the argument that is always 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.000
 up in a small country has 320 thousand 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.530
 inhabitants cj is the population of one of 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.130
 a neighborhood of são paulo that gave us 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.050
 type 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.440
 however it is good to remember two things that 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.410
 the first he the country has 14 a peak of 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.139
 14 billion dollars is not a team 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.970
 is not a small team near and second 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.650
 although it is a small country it is a country 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.620
 which has all the structures 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.139
 normal for a country of any country to be 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.090
 What is interesting is the same as 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.580
 fact for you to apply in falling into 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.580
 big countries do you need is to have a 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.690
 political creativity to put these 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.070
 procedures operate an 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.820
 no discussion in this regard was 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.500
 made 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.990
 he was simply lifting the fact a 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.510
 small country and that interests us 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.940
 showing the inability to simply 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.979
 do not think everything 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.360
 and I the same way you think of 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.470
 local situation how do you do to 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.560
 generalized by a global situation 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.539
 now tends to admit our agenda 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.289
 health care as they solve the issue 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.130
 of health 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.960
 this is a very interesting thing 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.830
 because when they were negotiating with the 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.590
 fmi 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.199
 they put a preferable imposition 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.169
 he talks we will not disassemble the 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.759
 social security system of the country 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.770
 is the famous state of well-being north 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.560
 1 Whatever they say we're not going to do 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.800
 cut some education cut something in health 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.099
 What's funny years this is comes to 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.889
 to be a joke is like the president of the 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.509
 fundamental in the field dominics era that 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.400
 could be a complete madman but Brazil 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.250
 it was not stupid, he knew not 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.849
 you make or require cuts in that 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.130
 level 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.680
 so he agreed he was the only one 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.440
 The situation of the monetary fund 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.469
 type of deposition the attempted spectator 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.510
 when the inhabitants have are 320 thousand and 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:41.290
 20 thousand is small is better than me 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.570
 it is very likely that you now have the 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.940
 joão is saying here 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.710
 several bankers went to jail right 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.170
 was it was then this was a thing 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.600
 missing them very interesting indeed 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.000
 learn a bankers by management 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.500
 fraudulent and even the prime minister 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.690
 wrong season 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:03.430
 he was found guilty of 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.580
 irresponsibility has already been a way 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.770
 Civil society very clear 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.990
 demonstrate their radical luck what 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.580
 It was done before it was 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.500
 different for example the English situation 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.870
 where doing the land goes into crisis and 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.640
 she is still using allowed 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.160
 throwing public money at banks 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.140
 debts. 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.640
 private partnerships in public and 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.950
 will allow banks for example 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.110
 use your public money to pay 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.320
 stock options that I especially do not know 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.570
 many migratory currents speak like this. 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.710
 There are a lot of people going for it. I think 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:42.490
 only the fact is that there is a country 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.930
 then there are full then but from the point of 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.790
 geographical view is not one of the 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.710
 more inviting is why I have 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.710
 is that the migratory flow below
