00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 rising 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.680
 the basement of milk supply sellers as supermarkets to block the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.639
 milk market 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.979
 this is the week from 11 March to Thursday 29 January 2015 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.979
 my name is fair to list 6 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.670
 faster, but it has been dominated by the last few weeks 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.169
 malaga with on board 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.759
 dairy farmers do not want to repay a tax debt and put 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.349
 a brake on production 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.509
 with the result that the milk has become scarce raw material 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.730
 together with one of the exports 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.640
 supported by the weak euro 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 feel the pitt and that has already been able to read a Buddhist this week 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.870
 has risen sharply to the training proposals of products such as butter and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110
 milk powder 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 these weeks a little extra has been added or rather one 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.460
 ship a little scoop 8 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.270
 because supply figures are coming from the Dutch milk market during this period 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.350
 of milk reported that those many percentages are lower than last year 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.790
 we work together each speak of the milk too short some points 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.190
 this means that the raw milk spot market is a thin market but very little 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.370
 lots of milk are traded 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.650
 however, there is a price ceiling on raw milk because processors can 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.340
 in the current market do not race against each other and make so much of it 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 the pot layout is increasing for work 5 but also by half a euro per 100 kilograms 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.760
 4 percent are supplied with fat 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.620
 the availability of mark is also limited in Germany 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.200
 the milk supply in the first three weeks of the new year is satisfactory 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.330
 almost 3 percent lower than at the start of 2014 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.679
 the spotters previously milk in north and south germany are two dead 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.130
 just like in the Netherlands with half a euro per 100 kilograms 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.209
 and that is then at 4 3com there was 7 percent delivered 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 the valuation of roompot type engine 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.159
 ran a number of boats with 10 euros per 100 kilos from the factory 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.790
 on the south side, the most potential for further price increases is the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.480
 provider is resisting the customers so far 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.350
 Buyers of so many products should own supermarkets and other white healers 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.480
 clearly still getting used to the higher price levels 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.589
 they will certainly be put a bit off the block in this period 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:15.079
 certainly because they still have the December forecast in mind and they were issued 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.839
 With low milk prices there is enough milk 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.719
 but the stock is running under the current market conditions 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.579
 man therefore empty 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.159
 adema sold in the short term 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.569
 if the market continues to develop over the next two months and so, but after some 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.199
 part is in the buy a knit era natural rains or a player to the 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.109
 production 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.389
 where I also have the buyers with the price tolerant 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.909
 and that may well lead to price increases in store shelves 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.909
 for fresh milk and other dairy products 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.619
 in the coming weeks it will of course be exciting with the guaranteed price 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.739
 he from frieslandcampina on monday for february 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.109
 and the fox to prices of various other dairy producers for January 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.680
 and then it becomes clear how the current market translates into the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.429
 dairy farmer 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:02.969
 6 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.249
 participants in the milk market continue to live look up for the three daily 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.329
 points though 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.269
 you can therefore also forty or fifty milk markets cross the government 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.289
 the track the business 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.459
