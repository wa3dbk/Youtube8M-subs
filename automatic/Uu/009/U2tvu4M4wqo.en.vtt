they<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.210> do<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> same<00:03:06.600> thing<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.070> then

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
they have to do the same thing and then

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.500 
they have to do the same thing and then
I<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> hundred<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> eighty<00:03:09.060> units<00:03:09.390> in

I have a hundred and eighty units in
total<00:03:10.400> again<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.670> economic<00:03:12.210> victory

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
total again for the economic victory

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.150 
total again for the economic victory
they<00:03:12.840> still<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.440> thirty<00:03:13.920> again

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
they still have to have thirty again

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.740 
they still have to have thirty again
this<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> exact<00:03:14.790> same<00:03:14.970> thing<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.420> ACA

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
this is the exact same thing for the ACA

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.270

and<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.990> Vernie<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.740> because<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.100> are

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and the Vernie just because they are

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.240 
and the Vernie just because they are
barbarian<00:03:18.270> tribes<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.470> they<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> hold<00:03:19.770> 60

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.930 
know I I personally find that to be a
little<00:03:35.010> bit<00:03:35.130> hard<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.610> know<00:03:35.700> hopefully

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
little bit hard but you know hopefully

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
matter now they only have to worry about

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.380 
matter now they only have to worry about
building<00:03:40.770> one<00:03:41.070> specific<00:03:41.670> cultural<00:03:42.000> building

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
building one specific cultural building

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.530 
building one specific cultural building
and<00:03:42.959> they<00:03:43.050> only<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:44.030> 40<00:03:45.030> provinces

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and they only have to be in 40 provinces

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.630 
and they only have to be in 40 provinces
which<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:46.200> actually<00:03:46.560> not<00:03:46.830> as<00:03:47.040> much<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.400> believe

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
which is actually not as much I believe

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.390 
which is actually not as much I believe
as<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.480> ice<00:03:48.750> Seanie<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.980> icy<00:03:50.340> knee

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400

is going for 60 and I think that vernier
even<00:03:53.250> almost<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.640> for<00:03:53.760> 60<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> could<00:03:54.330> be

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
even almost going for 60 but I could be

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.090 
even almost going for 60 but I could be
