combustion<00:00:26.640> engine<00:00:27.119> need<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> mix<00:00:27.960> gas<00:00:28.380> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
combustion engine need a mix gas with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.560 
combustion engine need a mix gas with
oxygen<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> oxygen<00:00:31.109> come<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.070> pass<00:00:32.570> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
oxygen so oxygen come from this pass the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.819 
oxygen so oxygen come from this pass the
air<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:34.170> come<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> here's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.969> throttle

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
air will come in and here's a throttle

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.229 
air will come in and here's a throttle
this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.149> position<00:00:39.149> center<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:40.410> measure

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
this is a position center will measure

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
this is a position center will measure
the<00:00:42.239> angle<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.200> plate<00:00:43.530> there's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.890> plate

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the angle of a plate there's a plate

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.600 
the angle of a plate there's a plate
inside<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> throttle<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:46.559> throttle<00:00:46.610> plate

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
inside the throttle the throttle plate

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020 
inside the throttle the throttle plate
open<00:00:48.329> large<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.829> open<00:00:50.250> large<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
open large when is open large there's a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.439 
open large when is open large there's a
more<00:00:51.300> oxygen<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:52.559> air<00:00:52.800> coming<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.610> suppose

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
more oxygen more air coming in suppose

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
more oxygen more air coming in suppose
you<00:00:54.719> press<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.410> gas<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.850> solid

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you press the gas so this is our solid

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
you press the gas so this is our solid
red<00:00:57.420> table<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.309> open<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> plate<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
red table that will open the plate so in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
red table that will open the plate so in
the<00:01:01.890> gas<00:01:02.100> flow<00:01:02.430> open<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> plate<00:01:02.940> yeah<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the gas flow open the plate yeah the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
the gas flow open the plate yeah the
price<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> gas<00:01:04.979> pedal<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.790> open<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
price in the gas pedal will open the the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.000 
price in the gas pedal will open the the
plate<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.439> cruise<00:01:10.860> control

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
plate or if you are on cruise control

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.719 
plate or if you are on cruise control
this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> cruise<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:13.500> also<00:01:14.010> open

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
this is a cruise control will also open

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.770 
this is a cruise control will also open
the<00:01:15.390> plate<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> idle

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the plate but if you are in the idle

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
the plate but if you are in the idle
you're<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.170> pressing<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> gas<00:01:19.830> pedal<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you're not pressing the gas pedal what

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
you're not pressing the gas pedal what
is<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> happen<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is going to happen so this is so the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
is going to happen so this is so the
unit<00:01:23.640> behind<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.840> called<00:01:24.990> IAC

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
unit behind it this is called IAC

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.999 
unit behind it this is called IAC
control<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.420> control<00:01:28.110> will<00:01:28.320> control<00:01:28.770> how

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
control that control will control how

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
control that control will control how
much<00:01:29.189> air<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.820> come<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> engine

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
much air will come in so the engine

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
much air will come in so the engine
still<00:01:32.310> keep<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.710> 800<00:01:34.820> rpm<00:01:36.020> instead<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:38.600> dead

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
still keep the 800 rpm instead of a dead

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.920 
still keep the 800 rpm instead of a dead
IAC<00:01:40.350> walking<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.909> control<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.570> air

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
IAC walking will control how much air

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.870 
IAC walking will control how much air
will<00:01:43.229> come<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.490> pressing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
will come in when you are not pressing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.230 
will come in when you are not pressing
the<00:01:45.180> gas<00:01:45.360> pedal<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the gas pedal so that when when this a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480 
the gas pedal so that when when this a
pedal<00:01:49.049> plate<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.799> closed

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
pedal plate is closed

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
pedal plate is closed
you<00:01:51.270> still<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.780> some<00:01:52.049> among<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> air<00:01:52.890> coming

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you still have some among the air coming

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.870 
you still have some among the air coming
in<00:01:53.579> how<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.829> repair<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.790> are

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
in how do you repair this there are

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
in how do you repair this there are
actually<00:01:57.570> five<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.229> options<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.399> do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually five different options how do

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.639 
actually five different options how do
you<00:01:59.579> repair<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.170> idle

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you repair what if there's an idle

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.940 
you repair what if there's an idle
control<00:02:02.219> unit<00:02:02.790> problem<00:02:03.210> watch<00:02:04.079> our<00:02:04.320> previous

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
control unit problem watch our previous

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
control unit problem watch our previous
video<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.899> have<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> idle<00:02:07.710> speed<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> fluctuation

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
video we have a idle speed a fluctuation

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.309 
video we have a idle speed a fluctuation
up<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.259> what<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.580> options<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.319> fix

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
up and down what are the options to fix

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.820 
up and down what are the options to fix
it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.310 
it
so<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.250> five<00:02:14.580> options<00:02:15.140> option<00:02:16.140> number

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
so there are five options option number

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.300 
so there are five options option number
one<00:02:16.710> you'll<00:02:17.310> clean<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.820> i<00:02:18.390> AC<00:02:18.840> unit<00:02:19.470> watch<00:02:20.100> our

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
one you'll clean the i AC unit watch our

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.680 
one you'll clean the i AC unit watch our
previous<00:02:20.670> video<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.870> option<00:02:22.200> number<00:02:22.440> two<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
previous video so option number two you

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.270 
previous video so option number two you
clearly<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.960> e<00:02:25.590> unit<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> new<00:02:27.690> gasket<00:02:28.280> so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
clearly is e unit with a new gasket so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.020 
clearly is e unit with a new gasket so
this<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> gasket<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.320> co<00:02:31.910> between<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this is a gasket the co between the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
this is a gasket the co between the
throttle<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.040> IC<00:02:35.040> unit<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:37.050> have

intake out take the throttle out in

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.170 
intake out take the throttle out in
order<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.269> reach<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.810> back<00:04:19.049> ISE<00:04:19.769> unit<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.430> take

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
order to reach the back ISE unit I take

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.230 
order to reach the back ISE unit I take
the<00:04:21.390> air<00:04:22.049> intake<00:04:22.530> out<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.460> didn't<00:04:23.880> really

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the air intake out but didn't really

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.590 
the air intake out but didn't really
connect<00:04:24.870> all<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.289> tables

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600

connect all the tables
to<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.960> photo<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.680> works<00:04:28.790> what<00:04:29.480> if<00:04:29.690> you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
to the photo and that works what if you

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.360 
to the photo and that works what if you
want<00:04:30.260> just<00:04:30.760> IAC<00:04:31.810> itself<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:33.500> not<00:04:33.800> as<00:04:34.040> easy

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
want just IAC itself it's not as easy

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.820 
want just IAC itself it's not as easy
but<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.480> doable<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:36.140> depends<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.650> your

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
but it's doable it depends on your

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.490 
but it's doable it depends on your
condition<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.550> will<00:04:37.610> discuss<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.570> part<00:04:38.960> the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
condition I will discuss that part the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.810 
condition I will discuss that part the
condition<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:41.150> there<00:04:41.750> are<00:04:41.900> two<00:04:42.260> schools<00:04:42.830> so

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
condition so there are two schools so
