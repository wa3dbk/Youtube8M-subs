00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.420
 nothing if the English naturalist charles darwin who discovered the principle of 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.849
 the tree of secularism 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.079
 all species are not returned some degree 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.739
 we are all 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.289
 with knowledge gained from Darwin 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.199
 representations of the tree of life have multiplied today 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.340
 can explore his kinship 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.599
 I strikingly 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.919
 during the lifetime of the royal navy the German naturalist ernest ekelund not 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.910
 published a tree of life that has long referred 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.690
 at the root and cell without a nucleus 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.600
 we are masters 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.530
 he sits in the midst of animals man 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 it's the vision of the time 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.569
 it is said that from the bottom of his retirement from permanence in the kitty 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.450
 darwin debt did not agree with his colleague 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.760
 for his part he would have given man a more discreet place - 2000 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.530
 anyway at this time 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.729
 to train kinship trees 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.509
 we rely solely on the physiology he beat but compared 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.910
 for animals for example 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.740
 we compared the skeletons 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 or the shape of the members of the organs 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 peta animals from the past were also examined 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.960
 those whose fossils we possessed 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.350
 by these methods little by little naturalists 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 it was specified he corrected the tree of Beijing 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.920
 during the 1980s 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.600
 molecular biology to upset the science of classifications 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 the machines analyze the bnp appeared 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 they helped build new trees of life 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.380
 they are based on the principle that two species with 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950
 very similar DNA and hate sequences 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 have to share a common ancestor very close 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.649
 there were some nice surprises after if we thought that the whales were doing 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.370
 part of the port family 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.319
 frankly I can not believe it 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.120
 more the same 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 until then lunel to show that in reality 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.590
 sidy diop adama who is the closest cousin of the whales 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.999
 Meme it 55 million years ago they shared by our common ancestors 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.600
 today with supercomputers and bioinformatics 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.359
 we're drowning under training 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.259
 we can build thousands of different trees 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.379
 revealing that each time new details 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
 very much discussed in the scientific community 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.089
 one of the examples concerning the new classification of present mammals 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.510
 an international team 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 recently published fascinating results on this subject 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.349
 they chose to represent their trees otherwise some 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.719
 let's start at the beginning 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.509
 I'm here I'll do it 166 million years ago 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 while all mammals with a common ancestor 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.409
 the first branch to appear 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.229
 and that of sparrows drags mammals laying eggs 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.219
 today there are only two 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.829
 the eclectic computer inc 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.509
 the second branch apparatus to 147 million years 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.379
 this is the time when the marsupials the animals carrying their baby in a 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.459
 ventral pocket separate move to land that can wear small in 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.760
 a case this money 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.429
 the tax collectors are very diversified 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.669
 the most corrupt countries close cousins 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.029
 prem 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:47.459
 laughing while walking towards the edge of the circle I come back to the present time 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:50.270
 recently 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.239
 a hundred thousand years ago appeared and the modern man 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.679
 homo sapiens more 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.179
 these unions 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:00.939
 but if I go back in time I will go back to the history of our family 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.960
 here 7 million years ago 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960
 our ancestors these are these bets the cats think 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.739
 10 9 million years ago new branching that of the great wise 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.950
 if I go much further back to the center at 87 million years ago 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.260
 I find myself at the point of origin to dump everything 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.610
 around this period we find the beginning of the branches of other major 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.039
 mammal families 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.870
 on the one hand, there are rodents 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.009
 they make up one third of all mammals 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.009
 on the other side 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.849
 open all hoofed animals and their immediate neighbors these are the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.849
 carnivorous 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.360
 at less than 65 million years 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.400
 there is a break I avoid representing myself by this dotted line 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 it corresponds to the disappearance of the dinosaurs 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.250
 we thought that after their disappearance 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.010
 the mammals the showers quickly replaced 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.230
 but this new tree to be revealed to be 10 million years before that happens 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.169
 occur 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.369
 why we do not know but this fact states these accidents 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.449
 cited in our research of this type 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.050
 in genetics but also field excavations in paleontology 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.559
 wind of century 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.589
 the idea of ​​the unique love of life 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:27.889
 but remain valid 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.939
 even though the tree has become much busier 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.719
 it is more complex than we thought 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.760
 nothing to destabilize charles darwin 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.870
 who claimed 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.810
 we had not seen the flowers they only signed a victory
