face a real change in the Republican
Party<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> party<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Party and I think this party in that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
Party and I think this party in that
sense<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.490> different<00:01:41.850> party<00:01:42.119> than<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
sense is a very different party than it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the government so I like I think there

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.380

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
are moments when you intervene but I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.550 
are moments when you intervene but I
want<00:02:35.540> stay<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> second<00:02:36.020> them<00:02:36.110> at<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.290> UN
