00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
coming into this championship my goal

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.799 
coming into this championship my goal
wasn't<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.980> when<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:48.579> was<00:00:48.700> just<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.059> do<00:00:49.239> my<00:00:49.270> best

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
wasn't to when it was just to do my best

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.200 
wasn't to when it was just to do my best
like<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.500> best<00:00:50.739> or<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.370> better<00:00:51.730> than<00:00:52.000> what<00:00:52.180> i

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
like the best or like better than what i

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.439 
like the best or like better than what i
did<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.570> training<00:00:53.020> i'll<00:00:53.620> admit<00:00:53.949> i<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:55.329> i

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
did in training i'll admit i think i

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.330 
did in training i'll admit i think i
could<00:00:55.690> have<00:00:55.780> done<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.989> little<00:00:56.320> better<00:00:56.649> but<00:00:57.070> i

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
could have done a little better but i

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.140 
could have done a little better but i
guess<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.329> fact<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.660> I<00:00:58.750> one<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.199> pretty<00:00:59.680> kind

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
guess the fact that I one is pretty kind

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.030 
guess the fact that I one is pretty kind
that's<00:01:02.150> kind<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.480> salt<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.500> what<00:01:03.800> was<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
that's kind of salt so what was the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.110 
that's kind of salt so what was the
highlight<00:01:04.190> for<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.610> here<00:01:04.880> at<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the road to becoming a great gymnast

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.359 
the road to becoming a great gymnast
isn't<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:54.500> hard<00:01:54.710> when<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.159> spend

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
isn't really hard when you have to spend

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.499 
isn't really hard when you have to spend
a<00:01:55.460> lot<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.729> time<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.090> gym<00:01:56.299> working

a lot of the time in the gym working
skills<00:01:56.990> over<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.590> over<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.829> over<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:58.729> is

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
skills over and over and over so what is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.340 
skills over and over and over so what is
it<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.060> keeps<00:01:59.359> you<00:01:59.539> motivated<00:01:59.689> on<00:02:00.320> a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
it that keeps you motivated on a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.469 
it that keeps you motivated on a
day-to-day<00:02:00.679> basis<00:02:02.259> probably<00:02:03.259> just<00:02:04.479> giving

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
day-to-day basis probably just giving

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.870 
day-to-day basis probably just giving
myself<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.899> daily<00:02:06.200> challenge<00:02:06.439> yeah<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.609> like

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
myself a daily challenge yeah it's like

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.669 
myself a daily challenge yeah it's like
every<00:02:08.239> day<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> was<00:02:08.840> planned<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.200> new<00:02:09.349> thing<00:02:09.590> I

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
every day I was planned a new thing I

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.589 
every day I was planned a new thing I
want<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.979> learn<00:02:10.129> her<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.459> prove<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.060> that's

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
want to learn her and prove and that's

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.210 
want to learn her and prove and that's
what<00:02:11.810> keeps<00:02:11.989> me<00:02:12.230> motivated<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.950> guess

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
what keeps me motivated I guess

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220 
what keeps me motivated I guess
not<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.450> shouldn't<00:02:15.690> revel<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
not that you shouldn't revel in the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.900 
not that you shouldn't revel in the
glory<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.220> comes<00:02:17.340> next<00:02:17.580> what's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
glory of this but what comes next what's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 
glory of this but what comes next what's
possible<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.690> what's<00:02:18.900> your<00:02:19.020> dream<00:02:19.220> well

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
possible for you what's your dream well

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.980

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.300 
so I guess to be chosen would be a
really<00:02:24.900> cool<00:02:25.200> experience<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> meet<00:02:26.190> all
