actually<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.980> very<00:02:57.310> good<00:02:57.489> thing<00:02:57.670> for<00:02:57.730> me<00:02:58.000> it's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
actually a very good thing for me it's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.360 
actually a very good thing for me it's
not<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> sticky<00:02:59.230> residue<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.769> not<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> smelly

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
not a sticky residue it's not a smelly

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.850 
not a sticky residue it's not a smelly
residue<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.269> can't<00:03:01.599> even<00:03:01.810> feel<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.500> residue

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
residue you can't even feel the residue

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.339 
residue you can't even feel the residue
in<00:03:02.980> your<00:03:03.099> hair<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> only<00:03:04.450> time<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.110> can

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
in your hair but the only time you can

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.110 
in your hair but the only time you can
tell<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.769> there's<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.040> residue<00:03:06.370> left<00:03:06.549> over<00:03:06.670> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
tell that there's a residue left over is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.220 
tell that there's a residue left over is
if<00:03:07.299> you're<00:03:07.420> styling<00:03:07.959> if<00:03:08.080> you're

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
if you're styling if you're

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.650 
if you're styling if you're
straightening<00:03:08.650> or<00:03:08.739> curling<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:10.060> at<00:03:10.299> first<00:03:10.480> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
straightening or curling and at first I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.000 
straightening or curling and at first I
was<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:10.989> like<00:03:11.079> oh<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.320> don't<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.680> want

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
was kind of like oh I don't really want

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.140 
was kind of like oh I don't really want
this<00:03:12.130> residue<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.640> there<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.760> want<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.090> be

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
this residue in there I want to be

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.640 
this residue in there I want to be
completely<00:03:13.480> washed<00:03:13.720> out<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.440> what<00:03:14.620> I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
completely washed out but what I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.259 
completely washed out but what I
realized<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.519> residue<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.090> stays

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
realized is that that residue that stays

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.090 
realized is that that residue that stays
on<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.900> mean<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.230> can't<00:03:17.470> feel<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
on there because I mean I can't feel it

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.580 
on there because I mean I can't feel it
but<00:03:18.489> when<00:03:19.299> I'm<00:03:19.450> styling<00:03:20.019> my<00:03:20.140> hair<00:03:20.170> I've

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
but when I'm styling my hair I've

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.800 
but when I'm styling my hair I've
noticed<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.280> holds<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.359> straight

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
noticed that it holds the straight

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.610 
noticed that it holds the straight
better<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.410> holds<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.130> curl<00:03:24.430> better<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:26.140> it

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
better it holds the curl better and it

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.789 
better it holds the curl better and it
also<00:03:26.829> keeps<00:03:27.310> my<00:03:27.549> hair<00:03:27.760> moist<00:03:28.359> if<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.319> don't<00:03:29.650> do

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
also keeps my hair moist if I don't do

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.220 
also keeps my hair moist if I don't do
any<00:03:30.010> styling<00:03:30.549> with<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:30.970> all<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.569> my<00:03:31.989> hair

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
any styling with it at all and my hair

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.800 
any styling with it at all and my hair
is<00:03:32.319> like<00:03:32.440> these<00:03:32.650> perfect<00:03:33.160> curls<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.480> go<00:03:34.630> out

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
is like these perfect curls I can go out

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.569 
is like these perfect curls I can go out
and<00:03:35.019> super<00:03:35.350> humid<00:03:35.650> heat<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.250> not<00:03:36.430> gonna

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
and super humid heat and it's not gonna

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.220 
and super humid heat and it's not gonna
freeze<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.239> normal<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:38.049> that's

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
freeze up like normal and I think that's

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.680 
freeze up like normal and I think that's
the<00:03:38.350> residue<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.920> leaves<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.310> there<00:03:39.690> but

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the residue that it leaves in there but

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.390 
the residue that it leaves in there but
honestly<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.139> really<00:03:41.440> will<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.739> love<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.250> it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
honestly I really will I love it and it

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.370 
honestly I really will I love it and it
makes<00:03:42.579> my<00:03:42.760> hair<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.840> doesn't<00:03:44.170> really<00:03:44.319> change

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
makes my hair it doesn't really change

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.050 
makes my hair it doesn't really change
the<00:03:44.769> color<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.220> doesn't<00:03:45.430> really<00:03:45.609> change<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the color it doesn't really change the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.699 
the color it doesn't really change the
texture<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:46.989> makes<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.319> much<00:03:47.470> much

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
texture it just makes it much much

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.860 
texture it just makes it much much

as silky as this one but and also this
one<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.049> like<00:04:02.200> maintains<00:04:02.620> my<00:04:02.799> curl<00:04:03.069> wallet

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
one it like maintains my curl wallet

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.390 
one it like maintains my curl wallet
sweat<00:04:04.049> this<00:04:05.049> one<00:04:05.319> almost<00:04:05.500> straightens<00:04:06.190> my

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
sweat this one almost straightens my

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.340 
sweat this one almost straightens my
hair<00:04:06.609> while<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.970> wet<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:08.109> doesn't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
hair while it's wet like it doesn't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.259 
hair while it's wet like it doesn't
piece<00:04:08.769> together<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.220> individual<00:04:09.639> curls<00:04:10.030> it's

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
piece together the individual curls it's

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.789 
piece together the individual curls it's
just<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.540> completely<00:04:10.989> straight<00:04:11.440> thing

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
just like a completely straight thing

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.009 
just like a completely straight thing
and<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.609> is<00:04:12.730> very<00:04:12.970> very<00:04:13.090> silky<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:13.659> I<00:04:13.689> didn't

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
and it is very very silky so I didn't

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.089 
and it is very very silky so I didn't
think<00:04:14.110> this<00:04:14.230> would<00:04:14.379> be<00:04:14.500> better<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.739> people

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
think this would be better for people

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.520 
think this would be better for people
with<00:04:15.250> straight<00:04:15.459> hair<00:04:15.659> maybe<00:04:16.659> but<00:04:17.049> I'm<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.200> curly

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
like pushing it from side to side um

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.350 
like pushing it from side to side um
it's<00:05:31.440> almost<00:05:31.710> like<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.370> it<00:05:32.850> doesn't<00:05:33.240> leave

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
it's almost like it's it doesn't leave

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.330 
it's almost like it's it doesn't leave
any<00:05:33.600> residue<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:34.530> it<00:05:34.620> almost<00:05:34.770> like<00:05:35.070> makes

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
any residue in but it almost like makes

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.060 
any residue in but it almost like makes
it<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:35.790> free<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.260> can't<00:05:37.560> really<00:05:37.740> work

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
it so free that you can't really work

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.530 
it so free that you can't really work
with<00:05:38.250> it<00:05:38.490> and<00:05:38.700> I<00:05:38.850> have<00:05:39.030> noticed<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.390> because

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
with it and I have noticed that because

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.930 
with it and I have noticed that because
it<00:05:39.870> doesn't<00:05:40.080> keep<00:05:40.410> that<00:05:40.620> perfect<00:05:41.040> curl<00:05:41.280> it's

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
it doesn't keep that perfect curl it's

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.390 
it doesn't keep that perfect curl it's
just<00:05:42.150> more<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.450> like<00:05:42.570> big<00:05:42.990> curls<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:44.070> think

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
just more of like big curls and I think

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.740 
just more of like big curls and I think
it'd<00:05:44.520> be<00:05:44.550> good<00:05:44.730> for<00:05:44.940> waves<00:05:45.090> or<00:05:45.360> straight<00:05:45.600> hair

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
it'd be good for waves or straight hair

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.960 
it'd be good for waves or straight hair
but<00:05:45.990> for<00:05:46.140> curly<00:05:46.410> people<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:47.610> just<00:05:47.640> kind<00:05:47.940> of

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
but for curly people it just kind of

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.370 
but for curly people it just kind of
keeps<00:05:48.150> my<00:05:48.330> curls<00:05:48.660> a<00:05:48.720> little<00:05:48.900> bit<00:05:48.990> frizzy<00:05:49.200> and

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
keeps my curls a little bit frizzy and

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.630 
keeps my curls a little bit frizzy and
lets<00:05:49.560> them<00:05:49.710> do<00:05:49.890> whatever<00:05:50.100> they<00:05:50.280> want<00:05:50.490> because

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
lets them do whatever they want because

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.070 
lets them do whatever they want because
they're<00:05:50.790> moisturize<00:05:51.300> but<00:05:51.510> not<00:05:51.780> weighed<00:05:52.050> down

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
they're moisturize but not weighed down

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.409 
they're moisturize but not weighed down
so<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.100> feel<00:05:53.310> like<00:05:53.340> this<00:05:53.610> one's<00:05:53.850> smooth<00:05:54.150> my<00:05:54.390> hair

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
so I feel like this one's smooth my hair

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.180 
so I feel like this one's smooth my hair
over<00:05:54.750> completely<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.350> keeps<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.680> style<00:05:55.980> and

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
over completely and keeps the style and

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.950 
over completely and keeps the style and
I<00:05:56.250> feel<00:05:56.430> like<00:05:56.580> this<00:05:56.730> would<00:05:56.880> rises<00:05:57.450> my<00:05:57.570> hair<00:05:57.780> but

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
I feel like this would rises my hair but

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.630 
I feel like this would rises my hair but
does<00:05:58.140> not<00:05:58.290> really<00:05:58.650> keep<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.070> style<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.520> is<00:05:59.610> a

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
does not really keep the style it is a

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.870 
does not really keep the style it is a
bit<00:05:59.880> more<00:06:00.030> difficult<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.540> work<00:06:00.720> with<00:06:00.860> um<00:06:01.880> so

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
bit more difficult to work with um so

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.430 
bit more difficult to work with um so
this<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.419> definitely<00:06:03.750> think<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:04.080> better<00:06:04.260> for

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
this I definitely think is better for

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.770 
this I definitely think is better for

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
you were thinking about one of the two

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.660 
you were thinking about one of the two
and<00:06:53.840> this<00:06:53.990> just<00:06:54.200> kind<00:06:54.350> of<00:06:54.500> solidifies<00:06:55.130> in<00:06:55.460> me

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
and this just kind of solidifies in me

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.730 
and this just kind of solidifies in me
just<00:06:56.240> because<00:06:56.510> it's<00:06:56.690> expensive<00:06:57.080> doesn't<00:06:57.620> mean

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
just because it's expensive doesn't mean

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.870 
just because it's expensive doesn't mean
it's<00:06:57.890> better<00:06:58.070> because<00:06:58.280> even<00:06:58.610> though<00:06:58.700> I<00:06:58.730> know

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
it's better because even though I know

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.180 
it's better because even though I know
that<00:06:59.390> sometimes<00:06:59.810> I<00:07:00.230> will<00:07:00.440> like<00:07:00.710> fall<00:07:00.950> into

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
that sometimes I will like fall into

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.830 
that sometimes I will like fall into
that<00:07:01.280> trap<00:07:01.340> of<00:07:01.640> thinking<00:07:01.820> that<00:07:02.180> expensive<00:07:02.720> is

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
that trap of thinking that expensive is

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.780 
that trap of thinking that expensive is
better<00:07:03.020> which<00:07:03.170> is<00:07:03.290> totally<00:07:03.620> not<00:07:03.740> true<00:07:03.890> I<00:07:04.220> know
