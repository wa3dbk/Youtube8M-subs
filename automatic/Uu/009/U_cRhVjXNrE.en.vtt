cord a good little yank and pulling it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.530 
cord a good little yank and pulling it
up<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.260> lengthens<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> back<00:00:32.040> leg<00:00:32.540> if

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
up and that lengthens the back leg if

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
up and that lengthens the back leg if
you<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> balance<00:00:34.110> pockets<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.460> need

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you got the balance pockets on you need

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.380 
you got the balance pockets on you need
to<00:00:35.850> position<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.230> balance<00:00:37.649> pockets<00:00:38.390> they

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to position the balance pockets they

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.139 
to position the balance pockets they
actually<00:00:39.930> clip<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.040> gray<00:00:41.340> web<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
actually clip to this gray web here and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.790 
actually clip to this gray web here and
they<00:00:42.420> should<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.809> positioned<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
they should be positioned in the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
they should be positioned in the
midpoint<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> gray<00:00:47.700> web<00:00:48.000> below<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
midpoint of the gray web below the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
midpoint of the gray web below the
sternum<00:00:49.140> strap<00:00:49.649> now<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.180> I've

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
sternum strap now you can see as I've

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
sternum strap now you can see as I've
got<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.440> adjusted<00:00:53.070> they're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
got this back think adjusted they're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.869 
got this back think adjusted they're
right<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> top<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> they're<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
right at the top so they're not if I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.090 
right at the top so they're not if I
move<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.329> body<00:00:57.570> they're<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.199> free<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.770> move<00:00:58.920> up

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
move my body they're not free to move up

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.330 
move my body they're not free to move up
and<00:00:59.250> down<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and down so what we need to do is to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.600 
and down so what we need to do is to
make<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.510> shoulder<00:01:04.229> straps<00:01:04.530> rotate<00:01:05.369> them

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
make the shoulder straps rotate them

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.109 
make the shoulder straps rotate them
backwards<00:01:06.860> by<00:01:07.860> shortening<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> back<00:01:08.729> link<00:01:08.970> at

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
backwards by shortening the back link at

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.070 
backwards by shortening the back link at
the<00:01:09.299> back<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.920> loosening<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.720> shoulder

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the back and by loosening the shoulder

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.600 
the back and by loosening the shoulder
straps<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.530> front<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.119> loosen<00:01:15.479> those

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
straps at the front so we loosen those

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
straps at the front so we loosen those
listen<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:17.990> shoulder<00:01:18.990> straps<00:01:19.850> like<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
listen the top shoulder straps like that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
listen the top shoulder straps like that
and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.530> pull<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.960> back<00:01:24.960> length<00:01:25.259> down

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and then we pull this back length down

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
and then we pull this back length down
to<00:01:25.950> shorten<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.880> length<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.600> we're

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
to shorten the back length what we're

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
to shorten the back length what we're
doing<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> shoulder<00:01:28.409> straps<00:01:28.740> rotating

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
doing the shoulder straps rotating

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.890 
doing the shoulder straps rotating
backwards<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.329> sliding

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
backwards you can see how that's sliding

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.760 
backwards you can see how that's sliding
down<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:34.159> little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.280> more

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.740 

that's<00:01:38.979> about<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.460> midpoint<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.540> grey

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
that's about the midpoint of the grey

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.429 
that's about the midpoint of the grey
web<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.310> now<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:45.600> retighten<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.780> front

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
web and now we can retighten the front

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.980 
web and now we can retighten the front
great<00:01:48.040> shoulder<00:01:48.790> strap<00:01:49.000> webs<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.810> top

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
great shoulder strap webs and the top

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.539 
great shoulder strap webs and the top
stabilizers<00:01:50.770> strap<00:01:51.070> webs<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.860> now<00:01:54.039> when<00:01:54.460> I

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
stabilizers strap webs so now when I

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.399 
stabilizers strap webs so now when I
move<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:57.390> top<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.630> bounds<00:01:58.929> pocket<00:01:59.259> that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
move that top of the bounds pocket that

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.969 
move that top of the bounds pocket that
clip<00:01:59.740> can<00:02:00.340> move<00:02:00.580> freely<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.420> we've<00:02:01.979> we've

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
clip can move freely so we've we've

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.270 
clip can move freely so we've we've
adjusted<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.850> back<00:02:04.090> length<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:05.830> be<00:02:05.950> correct

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
adjusted the back length to be correct

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.410 
adjusted the back length to be correct
when<00:02:07.060> we're<00:02:07.270> using<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.689> balance<00:02:07.990> pockets
