legs<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.860> sleeves<00:01:19.100> that<00:01:19.400> don't<00:01:19.580> really<00:01:19.790> know

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.880 

like<00:01:55.060> an<00:01:55.240> idea<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.750> how<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.230> going<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
like an idea of how this is going to

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.830 
like an idea of how this is going to
look<00:01:57.310> since<00:01:57.670> I'm<00:01:57.790> not<00:01:57.970> really<00:01:58.030> sure<00:01:58.540> what<00:01:58.720> I'm

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
look since I'm not really sure what I'm

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.220 
look since I'm not really sure what I'm
doing

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
doing

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.040 
doing
Oh<00:01:59.580> see<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> outside<00:02:01.480> of<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:01.690> pant

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
Oh see this is the outside of the pant

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.310 
Oh see this is the outside of the pant
right<00:02:02.380> side<00:02:02.650> out<00:02:07.410> okay<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.590> should<00:02:08.890> probably<00:02:08.920> be

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
right side out okay I should probably be

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.350 
right side out okay I should probably be
taping<00:02:11.320> this<00:02:11.710> at<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> last<00:02:12.550> minute<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.180> decided

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
taping this at the last minute I decided

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.120 
taping this at the last minute I decided
before<00:02:14.490> working<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.910> pant<00:02:16.120> leg<00:02:16.300> here<00:02:16.600> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
before working with the pant leg here I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.070 
before working with the pant leg here I
would<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.280> ahead<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.670> take<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.310> inseam

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
would go ahead and take in the inseam

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.320 
would go ahead and take in the inseam
about<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.290> half<00:02:23.560> an<00:02:23.710> inch<00:02:23.800> because<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:24.880> we

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
about a half an inch because when we

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.949 
about a half an inch because when we
when<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> put<00:02:26.740> these<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.070> Katherine<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.959> put

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
when I put these on Katherine and put

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.780 
when I put these on Katherine and put
pins<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.350> place<00:02:29.410> for<00:02:29.920> taking<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
pins in place for taking it in and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.370 
pins in place for taking it in and
making<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> plate<00:02:31.450> she<00:02:31.720> was<00:02:31.870> complaining

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
making the plate she was complaining

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:43.690 
making the plate she was complaining
that<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.590> felt<00:02:32.770> too<00:02:32.950> baggy<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:34.090> bum

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.610 

and<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:45.720> could<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.020> another<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.500> those

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and this could be another one of those

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.559 
and this could be another one of those
really<00:02:47.010> bad<00:02:47.190> ideas<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.819> guess<00:02:48.030> we'll<00:02:48.209> find<00:02:48.420> out

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
really bad ideas I guess we'll find out

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.600 
really bad ideas I guess we'll find out
if<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.650> we'll<00:02:50.010> start<00:02:50.220> over<00:02:50.310> with<00:02:50.580> another

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
if it is we'll start over with another

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.390 
if it is we'll start over with another
pair<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> pants<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.950> take<00:02:56.130> any

off of the front part of the pant in the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.720 
off of the front part of the pant in the
crotch<00:03:00.420> area<00:03:00.660> yet<00:03:01.280> because<00:03:02.280> she<00:03:02.459> didn't

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
crotch area yet because she didn't

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.780 
crotch area yet because she didn't
notice<00:03:03.390> any<00:03:04.430> any<00:03:05.430> complaints<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.330> point

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
notice any any complaints at that point

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.630 
notice any any complaints at that point
after<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:09.209> make<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> pleats

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
after we make the pleats

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.699 
after we make the pleats
but<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.269> was<00:03:12.510> an<00:03:12.630> obvious<00:03:12.840> sizing

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
but we know this was an obvious sizing

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:53.350 
but we know this was an obvious sizing
issue

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.500

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
I'm just reinforcing the part that we

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.190 
I'm just reinforcing the part that we
cut<00:03:59.569> off<00:03:59.750> with<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.140> serger<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:01.989> make<00:04:02.989> sure

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
cut off with the serger to make sure

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.500

that<00:04:03.349> we<00:04:03.620> don't<00:04:03.829> have<00:04:04.099> any<00:04:04.280> weak<00:04:04.819> spots<00:04:05.239> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
that we don't have any weak spots that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:17.009 
that we don't have any weak spots that
could<00:04:05.959> be<00:04:06.110> embarrassing

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:52.610 

you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.640 

so<00:04:53.620> we<00:04:53.830> did<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.010> little<00:04:54.250> finished<00:04:54.639> scene<00:04:54.970> here<00:04:55.240> I

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.140 

didn't<00:04:59.650> realize<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.340> what<00:05:00.370> size<00:05:00.820> cuff

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
didn't realize of what size cuff

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.170 
didn't realize of what size cuff
Katherine<00:05:01.690> was<00:05:02.260> going<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.860> want<00:05:03.100> on<00:05:03.400> her<00:05:03.550> pants

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
Katherine was going to want on her pants

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.140 
Katherine was going to want on her pants
or<00:05:04.840> her<00:05:04.960> shorts<00:05:05.520> until<00:05:06.520> I'd<00:05:06.669> already<00:05:06.850> taken

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
or her shorts until I'd already taken

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.689 
or her shorts until I'd already taken
off<00:05:07.419> too<00:05:07.630> much<00:05:07.780> length<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:09.190> we're<00:05:09.490> going<00:05:09.610> to

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
off too much length so we're going to

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.129 
off too much length so we're going to
kind<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.000> we're<00:05:10.210> going<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.479> cheat<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:11.020> little

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
kind of we're going to cheat a little

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.870 
kind of we're going to cheat a little
bit<00:05:14.820> fold<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:16.030> up<00:05:16.150> like<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:17.520> know<00:05:18.520> this<00:05:18.760> is

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
bit fold it up like so I know this is

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.270 
bit fold it up like so I know this is
going<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.060> work<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.389> pictured<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.870> my<00:05:19.930> head

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.700 

so<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:25.000> can<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.389> away<00:05:25.560> with<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
so I think I can get away with the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.530 
so I think I can get away with the
mistake<00:05:27.100> kind<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.580> by<00:05:27.669> hiding<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.330> this

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
mistake kind of by hiding it like this

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.770 
mistake kind of by hiding it like this
you<00:05:29.530> know<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.680> should<00:05:29.979> have<00:05:30.360> folded<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.540> fabric

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
you know I should have folded the fabric

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.770 
you know I should have folded the fabric
you<00:05:32.710> know<00:05:32.830> way<00:05:33.100> up<00:05:33.310> here<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.570> when<00:05:34.720> I

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
you know way up here so that when I

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.450 
you know way up here so that when I
tucked<00:05:35.139> it<00:05:35.320> inside<00:05:35.500> out<00:05:35.830> we<00:05:35.979> still<00:05:36.220> had<00:05:36.340> the

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
tucked it inside out we still had the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.240 
tucked it inside out we still had the
right<00:05:36.639> side<00:05:36.850> fabric<00:05:37.300> showing<00:05:37.919> but<00:05:38.919> since<00:05:39.190> I

right side fabric showing but since I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.770 
right side fabric showing but since I
didn't<00:05:39.460> leave<00:05:39.639> enough<00:05:39.910> length<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.419> is<00:05:40.479> what

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
didn't leave enough length this is what

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.150 
didn't leave enough length this is what
I'll<00:05:40.870> do<00:05:41.020> it's<00:05:41.200> either<00:05:41.380> that<00:05:41.560> or<00:05:41.620> start<00:05:41.950> over

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
I'll do it's either that or start over

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.870 
I'll do it's either that or start over
with<00:05:42.280> another<00:05:42.520> pair<00:05:42.760> of<00:05:42.820> pants<00:05:44.340> I'll<00:05:45.340> pin<00:05:45.699> this

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
with another pair of pants I'll pin this

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.000 
with another pair of pants I'll pin this
in<00:05:46.090> place<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:46.660> then<00:05:46.750> hand<00:05:47.169> stitch<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.889> it

in place and then hand stitch so that it

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.430 
in place and then hand stitch so that it
stays<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.639> this<00:05:52.419> and<00:05:54.630> then<00:05:55.630> we<00:05:55.870> will<00:05:56.050> put<00:05:56.289> on

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
stays like this and then we will put on
