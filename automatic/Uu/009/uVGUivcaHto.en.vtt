actually a really clean beam

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.979 
actually a really clean beam
surprisingly<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> TIR<00:00:58.469> optics<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> has

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
surprisingly for a TIR optics but it has

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.640 
surprisingly for a TIR optics but it has
good<00:01:01.260> throw<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> mean<00:01:01.890> I'd<00:01:02.010> say<00:01:02.539> 50<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> 75<00:01:04.170> yards

good throw I mean I'd say 50 to 75 yards
works<00:01:04.920> pretty<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:06.900> has<00:01:07.080> less<00:01:07.380> throw<00:01:07.650> than

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
works pretty good it has less throw than

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.700 
works pretty good it has less throw than
the<00:01:07.890> LD<00:01:08.159> 20<00:01:08.460> I'll<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.670> ahead<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.880> show<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
the LD 20 I'll go ahead and show that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
the LD 20 I'll go ahead and show that
here's<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> LD<00:01:11.159> 20<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.299> left<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here's the LD 20 on the left on the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
here's the LD 20 on the left on the
turbo<00:01:13.770> mode<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.490> these<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.820> both

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
turbo mode and by the way these are both

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
turbo mode and by the way these are both
fresh<00:01:15.390> batteries<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:16.530> double<00:01:16.830> A<00:01:16.890> batteries

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
fresh batteries two double A batteries

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
fresh batteries two double A batteries
same<00:01:17.640> batteries<00:01:18.060> Duracell<00:01:18.570> came<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
same batteries Duracell came out of the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
same batteries Duracell came out of the
same<00:01:19.830> package<00:01:20.540> both<00:01:21.540> brand<00:01:21.840> new<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:23.700> have

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
same package both brand new and I have

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
same package both brand new and I have
the<00:01:24.360> camera<00:01:24.810> exposure<00:01:25.500> lock<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.460> not

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the camera exposure lock so it's not

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
the camera exposure lock so it's not
going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> compensate<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> lighting<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
going to compensate for the lighting but

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to compensate for the lighting but
you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.220> they're<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.490> comparable

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you can see they're really comparable

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.069 
you can see they're really comparable
the<00:01:30.210> LD<00:01:30.450> 20<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.950> has<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.369> throw<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.689> I'd<00:01:33.840> say

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the LD 20 it has more throw but I'd say

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.130 
the LD 20 it has more throw but I'd say
less<00:01:34.350> spill<00:01:34.710> overall<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.570> Coleman

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
less spill overall this just the Coleman

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
less spill overall this just the Coleman
light<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.409> kind<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> big<00:01:38.299> just<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.420> big

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

wall of light with some still some

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
wall of light with some still some
usable<00:01:42.600> throw<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.770> anyways<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.280> wanted

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
