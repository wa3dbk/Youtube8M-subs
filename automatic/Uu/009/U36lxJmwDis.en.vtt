00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 oh fuck it yes what if the mondeo the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.250
 equal to full growing 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.010
 yes, so bright or come to this tool 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 blog with we have one more now 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.620
 I changed the tone a bit, I hope 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.480
 that this one already a bit louder 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.660
 I have to hear that, otherwise I always have to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 make a whole corner louder 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.060
 we just did not talk 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.320
 what we want to talk about 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.059
 But I've thought of a topic and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 Although you had told me yesterday that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 you now also like your motorcycle 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 a little something to do with it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 depending on how that then in the studio with 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 the money works and so and maybe 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.280
 Can we talk about it? 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 I still do on my motorcycle 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.310
 What else would you like about your or yours? 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.470
 ever want to make one of yours 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.910
 other levers are yours and what else? 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.910
 good at 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.240
 Last year was good that can happen 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:29.800
 I had a bee stung and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:37.030
 please bring a suit 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:39.300
 stop in panic then not sensible 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.300
 placed 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.110
 So what's going to be built in one place 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.350
 what do you want for your moped yet 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.350
 do 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:30.470
 I still dream of a 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:31.880
 will make stiff off the blue 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.200
 do not even leave 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.760
 I would just give them over again 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 do you always polish that someday 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.290
 sale then you can say hey 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.800
 you just still under it if the box can 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.800
 pull it off 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:03:06.860
 I think I did not that would be 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.520
 really stupid so definitely 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.520
 clear 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.940
 Yes 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.550
 otherwise 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.800
 summer enough 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.970
 first go 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:47.150

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.840

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.840

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.890
 The scooter is so over it 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.109
 the weir almost you can do it 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.010
 until they drive to the front yes what does it mean 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.329
 if the mondeo the same flex in advance 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.530
 then I can tell what I am 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.530
 still wanting to do my engine 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.090
 I definitely want to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.479

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.400

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:42.380

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.539
 I do not think mine either 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.610

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:50.060
