00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.740 

I<00:03:08.620> think<00:03:09.400> we<00:03:09.490> knew<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.270> know<00:03:10.390> because

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
I think we knew that you know because

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.900 
I think we knew that you know because
they<00:03:10.900> hadn't<00:03:11.170> played<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.410> game<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.550> long<00:03:12.700> time

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
they hadn't played a game in a long time

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.490 
they hadn't played a game in a long time
the<00:03:13.209> Bahamas<00:03:13.660> team<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.110> they<00:03:14.200> would<00:03:14.350> come

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the Bahamas team that they would come

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.809 
the Bahamas team that they would come
out<00:03:14.650> they<00:03:14.920> would<00:03:15.280> come<00:03:15.430> out<00:03:15.490> with<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.670> lot<00:03:15.790> of

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
out they would come out with a lot of

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.670 
out they would come out with a lot of
energy<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.600> home<00:03:16.810> especially<00:03:17.140> playing

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
energy at home especially playing

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.740 
energy at home especially playing
against<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.069> US<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.300> knew<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.600> we'd

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
against the US and we knew that we'd

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.090 
against the US and we knew that we'd
have<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.900> grind<00:03:20.350> them<00:03:20.500> down<00:03:20.530> we<00:03:20.950> were

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
have to grind them down we were

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.000 
have to grind them down we were
certainly<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.730> better<00:03:21.910> team<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:23.410> created

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
certainly the better team we created

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.729 
certainly the better team we created
chances<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.520> think<00:03:24.760> throughout<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.300> game

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
chances I think throughout the game

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.710 
chances I think throughout the game
sorry<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.160> think<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.670> created<00:03:28.030> probably<00:03:28.330> 2025

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
sorry I think we created probably 2025

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.040 
sorry I think we created probably 2025
chances<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.560> score<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:31.390> unfortunately<00:03:31.900> we

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
chances to score so unfortunately we

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.690 
chances to score so unfortunately we
couldn't<00:03:32.230> get<00:03:32.410> enough<00:03:32.620> goals<00:03:32.860> early<00:03:33.100> enough

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
couldn't get enough goals early enough

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.479 
couldn't get enough goals early enough
to<00:03:33.940> put<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.209> game<00:03:34.360> away<00:03:34.770> they<00:03:35.770> got<00:03:35.950> back<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.340> it

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
to put the game away they got back in it

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.979 
to put the game away they got back in it
with<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.880> goal<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.330> think<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.690> reaction

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
with that goal but I think the reaction

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.900 
with that goal but I think the reaction
from<00:03:38.319> our<00:03:38.470> players<00:03:38.770> was<00:03:39.130> excellent<00:03:39.580> as<00:03:39.760> soon

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
from our players was excellent as soon

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.330 
from our players was excellent as soon
as<00:03:40.030> they<00:03:40.150> scored<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:41.470> went<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.739> took<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.010> 2-1

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
as they scored we went in took the 2-1

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
as they scored we went in took the 2-1
lead<00:03:42.550> and<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.030> 3-1<00:03:43.390> lead<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.870> almost

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
lead and then the 3-1 lead and almost

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.600 
lead and then the 3-1 lead and almost
immediately<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:44.950> thought<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.310> was<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> good

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
immediately so I thought it was a good

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.370 
immediately so I thought it was a good
reaction<00:03:45.850> by<00:03:46.030> us<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.959> know<00:03:47.050> in<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.260> way

yeah<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:21.700> think<00:04:21.820> with<00:04:22.120> this<00:04:22.210> particular<00:04:22.419> group

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
yeah I think with this particular group

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.570 
yeah I think with this particular group
I<00:04:23.110> think<00:04:23.169> we<00:04:23.440> expanded<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.130> pool<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.340> little

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
I think we expanded the pool a little

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.980 
I think we expanded the pool a little
bit<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:25.090> know<00:04:25.180> there<00:04:25.360> were<00:04:25.450> certain<00:04:25.630> players

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
bit you know there were certain players

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.420 
bit you know there were certain players
who<00:04:26.169> were<00:04:26.260> not<00:04:26.470> available<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.340> the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
who were not available because of the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 
who were not available because of the
MLS<00:04:27.789> homegrown<00:04:28.180> game<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.840> because<00:04:29.169> some

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
MLS homegrown game and because some

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.159 
MLS homegrown game and because some
didn't<00:04:29.860> get<00:04:29.979> released<00:04:30.280> from<00:04:30.520> their<00:04:30.760> clubs<00:04:31.169> so

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
didn't get released from their clubs so

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.810 
didn't get released from their clubs so
we<00:04:32.380> had<00:04:32.620> an<00:04:32.710> opportunity<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.220> expand<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.640> pool

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
we had an opportunity to expand the pool

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.460 
we had an opportunity to expand the pool
