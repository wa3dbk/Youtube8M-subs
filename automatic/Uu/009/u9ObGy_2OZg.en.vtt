00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
industrial design that we thought would

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
industrial design that we thought would

not only really looks really cool but
it's<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.379> part<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.129> functional

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's actually part it's very functional

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's actually part it's very functional
the<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.149> designed<00:00:48.270> particularly<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the way it's designed particularly in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
the way it's designed particularly in
the<00:00:49.200> back<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the back if you look at it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
the back if you look at it
I<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.730> little<00:00:50.940> recesses<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.780> for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I have little recesses in there for

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
I have little recesses in there for
extra<00:00:52.079> ventilation<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> power<00:00:53.579> supply

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
extra ventilation for the power supply

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
extra ventilation for the power supply
to<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.420> everything<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> needs<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to get on everything it needs so that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
to get on everything it needs so that
you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.399> accidentally<00:00:56.789> jamming

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you know you're not accidentally jamming

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
you know you're not accidentally jamming
it<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.390> against<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> wall<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.680> burning

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it up against the wall and like burning

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
it up against the wall and like burning
anything<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> say<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> really

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
anything out and say it's a really

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.819 
anything out and say it's a really
really<00:01:00.750> cool<00:01:00.930> design<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:01.649> works<00:01:01.770> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really cool design we think works really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.680 
really cool design we think works really
