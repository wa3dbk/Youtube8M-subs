 data on the freckle of the people 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.990

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.970
 twister 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.970
 but it exhibits then 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.630
 loading late 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.010
 position on discord without taking it 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.040
 but let's go 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.650
 I can play the game the final game 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.210
 and then if they want to hit us as a game 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.250
 with the tricks and those days 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.550
 they want from sinop without distinguishing from 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.650
 other side 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.520
 but anything and a building 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.060
 who lives another game is so bad is that 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.189
 I have 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.189
 let me know I do not have time 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 same 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.180
 and coal and now 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.959
 arriving at the liberty airport 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.959
 normalized 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.830
 as you can see with the vine in a store 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:05.440
 book and I want to jump this same 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.440
 if they want to see the story by phone 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:16.739
 the direction of selections 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.739
 and ready 5 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.620
 your good boy I have a little star 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.170
 for mind 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.170
 I'm running the game 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.950
 a terminal t2 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.950
 and obviously for any other 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.160
 with him 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.420
 let's say that with a midrange they have 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.640
 measure to cognac 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.640
 the greeting with good times 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.870
 In each hand 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.530
 what 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.530
 at your discretion win 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.040
 in the eyes 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.040
 to much 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.750
 to build 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.930
 10 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.930
 and in its way 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.340
 then if you like the video like 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.090
 share the google bollards either 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.400
 separate this said in the comments if 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.030
 they want another game anything that 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.870
 erase 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 the water web 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.580
 the Mayans 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.800
 at 30 years old 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.800
