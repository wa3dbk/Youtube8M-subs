00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.840
The UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.700
arguably the most important institution of its kind in the world.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.490
It celebrates this year its centenary.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
Everyone is a specialist in the region. Everyone is

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.490
exceptionally well-travelled in the region.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.650
Given that we are studying one particular part of the word, and given that we often

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.480
sort of focus on specific social issues,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.969
it's sort of quite clear that you can’t study these issues from one single disciplinary

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.010
perspective.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.469
The world out there isn't neatly divided
into different disciplines.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.519
One of the good things about studying at SSEES is that people are not only a part

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.690
of UCL,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.170
which can be sometimes really big, but they also belong to a small community.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.260
One-on-one, the smaller classes we were in with some of the professors that I worked with, they

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.989
made a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.260
a big impression on me because they were very learned people, they were

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.580
kind of good people, you know they
wanted to share their knowledge, and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.830
it's those kind of smaller groups, those classrooms where you’re working

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.299
with individual professors and how that affects you as a person.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.009
My day-to-day life is spent

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.039
with the history staff, with fellow history PhDs,

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.270
but you come into contact with a whole range of people who are doing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.459
different disciplines, so they’re doing literature, they’re doing economics, they’re doing

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.240
modern

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.810
foreign policy. SSEES has a very, very

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.920
important element to it, which is its
area focus, which goes

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.220
hand-in-hand with its
interdisciplinarity. Just being

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.259
surrounded by these people talking about ideas, it really broadens your mind

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.069
and my research is quite interdisciplinary anyway, so I find it a

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.970
really useful stimulus just to make me
think in

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.539
other directions, and I really don't think  that I would have got that if I’d just been

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.509
in the history department at another
university. Over the course of time my

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.690
research shifted quite significantly
away from international relations

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.959
and looks much more at sort of migration, sexuality and health,

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.989
and this wasn't the result of
my attending

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.030
seminars and lectures at SSEES, or at least not only

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.330
due to that, but it was sort of talking
to colleagues in the corridors or over

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.030
a coffee

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.000
in the senior common room, asking what they were working on,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.140
and my interest sort of being piqued and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.270
my research therefore being sent off in

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.950
unexpected directions.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.440
Here we believe that language is culture, so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.780
that’s the approach from which we teach the languages. At this point in time,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.390
we may be the only institution in the
world that teaches

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.450
18 languages of the region. All the
academics working at

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.640
SSEES are obviously fluent in a number of these East European languages

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.320
and they incorporate these language skills into their research, and that brings about

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.010
very important cultural insights into
whatever discipline

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.830
one is engaged in doing research.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.480
The school was founded by several
extraordinary individuals,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.569
among them the three most prominent are Sir Bernard Pares,

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.209
Robert Seton-Watson and Tomas

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.130
Garrigue Masaryk. Masaryk delivered a very important lecture

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.190
in October 1915 on the fate of small
nations of Europe. He later became the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.570
first president

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.130
of independent Czechoslovakia. Many
prominent scholars,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.820
politicians, artists, writers

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.260
from the region, who were later joined by a

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.590
set of extraordinary researchers from
all over the world,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.780
produced a remarkable body of
scholarships over these

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.780
100 years and trained a broad range of students.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.180
Among our alumni

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.400
we count prime ministers, parliamentarians,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.060
functionaries of many important
international organisations

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.760
and many successful business people.
