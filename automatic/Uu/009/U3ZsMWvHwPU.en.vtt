this<00:03:04.760> step<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.239> straight<00:03:05.450> basic<00:03:05.900> we're<00:03:06.049> just

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
this step is straight basic we're just

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.660 
this step is straight basic we're just
going<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.500> comment<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.280> some<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.610> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to comment on some of the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to comment on some of the
fundamentals<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.570> tango<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.019> slightly

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
fundamentals of the tango a slightly

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.110 
fundamentals of the tango a slightly
more<00:03:09.470> staccato<00:03:09.739> action<00:03:10.580> through<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.820> legs

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
more staccato action through the legs

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.449 
more staccato action through the legs
making<00:03:11.959> sure<00:03:12.290> your<00:03:12.500> posture<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.980> great<00:03:13.250> and

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
making sure your posture is great and

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.690 
making sure your posture is great and
just<00:03:14.000> checking<00:03:14.330> out<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.540> frame<00:03:14.860> okay<00:03:15.860> so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
just checking out the frame okay so

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.100 
just checking out the frame okay so
let's<00:03:16.820> look<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.209> staccato<00:03:17.600> action

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
let's look at the staccato action

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.880 
let's look at the staccato action
through<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.350> legs

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
through the legs

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.670 
through the legs
so<00:03:19.600> moving<00:03:20.600> force<00:03:20.930> we're<00:03:21.140> going<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.380> think<00:03:21.560> of

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
so moving force we're going to think of

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.410 
so moving force we're going to think of
taking<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:22.100> step<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.519> collecting<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.239> weight

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
taking a step in collecting the weight

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.390 
taking a step in collecting the weight
step<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.049> collecting<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.769> way<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:24.980> step<00:03:25.220> in

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
step and collecting the way it step in

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.490 
step and collecting the way it step in
collecting<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> weight<00:03:26.269> then<00:03:26.959> going<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
collecting the weight then going to the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.070 
collecting the weight then going to the
side<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.100> closing<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.640> legs<00:03:29.090> together<00:03:29.299> so

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
side and closing the legs together so

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.840 
side and closing the legs together so
it's<00:03:30.260> not<00:03:30.380> going<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.010> same<00:03:31.310> smooth

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
