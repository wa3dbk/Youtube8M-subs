00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.749 

so<00:00:02.510> last<00:00:02.720> night<00:00:02.840> I<00:00:03.200> decided<00:00:03.710> to<00:00:03.980> jump<00:00:04.220> in<00:00:04.430> and

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
so last night I decided to jump in and

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.060 
so last night I decided to jump in and
start<00:00:05.300> working<00:00:05.450> on<00:00:05.720> this<00:00:05.900> tower<00:00:07.690> it's<00:00:08.690> such<00:00:08.930> a

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
start working on this tower it's such a

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.589 
start working on this tower it's such a
such<00:00:10.070> an<00:00:10.220> exciting<00:00:10.519> piece<00:00:10.790> that<00:00:11.000> I<00:00:11.059> couldn't

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
such an exciting piece that I couldn't

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.589 
such an exciting piece that I couldn't
help<00:00:11.660> myself<00:00:11.840> but<00:00:12.410> in<00:00:13.219> doing<00:00:13.519> so<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:13.910> ran<00:00:14.300> into<00:00:14.330> a

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
help myself but in doing so I ran into a

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.230 
help myself but in doing so I ran into a
number<00:00:14.929> of<00:00:15.019> issues<00:00:15.139> that<00:00:15.590> i<00:00:16.580> thought<00:00:17.060> i'd

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
number of issues that i thought i'd

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.599 
number of issues that i thought i'd
share<00:00:17.449> with<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.890> way<00:00:19.039> if<00:00:19.310> you<00:00:19.520> were

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
share with you and that way if you were

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.160 
share with you and that way if you were
planning<00:00:19.850> to<00:00:20.230> build<00:00:21.230> one<00:00:21.440> of<00:00:21.470> these<00:00:21.590> yourself

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
planning to build one of these yourself

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.019 
planning to build one of these yourself
you<00:00:24.170> could<00:00:24.650> learn<00:00:24.800> from<00:00:24.859> from<00:00:25.550> what<00:00:25.699> I've<00:00:25.820> done

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
you could learn from from what I've done

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.559 
you could learn from from what I've done
already<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:29.180> first<00:00:29.420> thing<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.930> note<00:00:30.140> is<00:00:30.380> that

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:31.569 
already the first thing to note is that

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:38.049 
already the first thing to note is that
the<00:00:32.569> the<00:00:33.260> floors<00:00:33.530> are<00:00:35.350> troublesome<00:00:36.909> this<00:00:37.909> is

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
the the floors are troublesome this is

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.969 
the the floors are troublesome this is
actually<00:00:38.389> not<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.629> very<00:00:39.079> simple<00:00:39.379> kid<00:00:39.649> although

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
actually not a very simple kid although

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.669 
actually not a very simple kid although
it<00:00:40.129> has<00:00:40.339> very<00:00:41.299> few<00:00:41.539> pieces<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.260> pieces

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
it has very few pieces and the pieces

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.789 
it has very few pieces and the pieces
are<00:00:43.280> very<00:00:43.519> straightforward<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.120> put<00:00:44.269> together

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:44.799 
are very straightforward to put together

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.789 
are very straightforward to put together
it's<00:00:45.799> it<00:00:46.449> there's<00:00:47.449> a<00:00:47.569> it's<00:00:48.319> a<00:00:48.469> lot<00:00:48.649> more

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's it there's a it's a lot more

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.559 
it's it there's a it's a lot more
difficult<00:00:49.339> than<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:49.549> seems<00:00:49.909> at<00:00:50.089> first<00:00:50.120> glance

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
difficult than it seems at first glance

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.729 
difficult than it seems at first glance
the<00:00:51.379> first<00:00:51.920> problem<00:00:52.369> is<00:00:52.489> that<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:54.260> connection

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
the first problem is that the connection

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.139 
the first problem is that the connection
points<00:00:55.219> between<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.299> walls<00:00:56.539> where<00:00:57.530> there's<00:00:57.829> a

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
points between the walls where there's a

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.019 
points between the walls where there's a
you<00:00:59.149> know<00:00:59.209> it's<00:00:59.600> these<00:00:59.749> interlocking<00:01:00.170> bricks

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:01.029 
you know it's these interlocking bricks

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:05.620 
you know it's these interlocking bricks
have<00:01:02.029> a<00:01:02.059> lot<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.299> flash<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:03.079> lot<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:03.920> flesh<00:01:04.630> a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
have a lot of flash a lot of flesh a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.200 
have a lot of flash a lot of flesh a
pretty<00:01:06.109> hefty<00:01:06.320> mold<00:01:06.740> line<00:01:07.009> actually<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.090> not

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
pretty hefty mold line actually it's not

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.120 
pretty hefty mold line actually it's not
even<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.450> flash<00:01:08.689> it's<00:01:09.109> really<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> mold<00:01:09.649> line<00:01:09.859> and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
even a flash it's really a mold line and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.969 
even a flash it's really a mold line and
I<00:01:10.640> would<00:01:11.299> recommend<00:01:11.600> making<00:01:12.170> sure<00:01:12.649> that<00:01:12.859> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
I would recommend making sure that you

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.740 
I would recommend making sure that you
go<00:01:13.159> in<00:01:13.340> there<00:01:13.520> first<00:01:13.880> with<00:01:14.119> an<00:01:14.240> exacto<00:01:14.539> blade

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
go in there first with an exacto blade

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.859 
go in there first with an exacto blade
to<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.369> know<00:01:16.460> not<00:01:16.729> off<00:01:16.969> the<00:01:17.000> bulk<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.539> it<00:01:17.659> and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
to you know not off the bulk of it and

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.340 
to you know not off the bulk of it and
then<00:01:18.439> with<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.679> file<00:01:19.039> perhaps<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:20.390> bring<00:01:21.259> it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
then with a file perhaps to bring it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.469 
then with a file perhaps to bring it
down<00:01:21.500> even<00:01:21.710> more<00:01:21.859> and<00:01:22.369> then<00:01:22.850> test<00:01:23.210> fit

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
down even more and then test fit

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.429 
down even more and then test fit
everything<00:01:23.780> because<00:01:25.719> before<00:01:26.719> you<00:01:26.869> do<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.109> it

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
everything because before you do that it

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.889 
everything because before you do that it
won't<00:01:27.619> fit<00:01:27.770> at<00:01:27.920> all<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.399> if<00:01:29.359> you<00:01:29.450> don't<00:01:29.630> do<00:01:29.810> it

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
won't fit at all and if you don't do it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.980 
won't fit at all and if you don't do it
enough<00:01:30.170> it'll<00:01:30.439> fit<00:01:30.770> tight<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.780> may

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
enough it'll fit tight and that may

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.530 
enough it'll fit tight and that may
affect

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
affect

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.420 
affect
the<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.020> shape<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> piece<00:01:36.890> if<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.220> too

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
the the shape of the piece if it's too

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.270 
the the shape of the piece if it's too
tight<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.390> want<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.950> want<00:01:40.159> to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
tight so you want it to be you want to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
tight so you want it to be you want to
slide<00:01:40.700> together<00:01:40.880> easily<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.110> when<00:01:42.380> you're

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
slide together easily so when you're

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.950 
slide together easily so when you're
cleaning<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.860> up<00:01:42.979> keep<00:01:43.159> that<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.520> mind<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
cleaning it up keep that in mind the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.529 
cleaning it up keep that in mind the
second<00:01:45.350> thing<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.210> second<00:01:47.509> reason

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
second thing is and the second reason

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.200 
second thing is and the second reason
why<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.320> difficult<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:48.920> your<00:01:49.909> goal

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
why this is difficult is that your goal

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.270 
why this is difficult is that your goal
when<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.600> put<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.899> together<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.979> create

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
when you put this together is to create

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.800 
when you put this together is to create
what<00:01:52.399> is<00:01:52.429> essentially<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.939> perfect<00:01:53.330> circle<00:01:53.570> out

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
what is essentially a perfect circle out

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.190 
what is essentially a perfect circle out
of<00:01:53.929> four<00:01:54.200> curves<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.780> without<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> guide

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
of four curves and without a guide

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.529 
of four curves and without a guide
that's<00:01:57.590> pretty<00:01:57.950> much<00:01:58.220> impossible<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:59.299> do

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
that's pretty much impossible to do

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.660 
that's pretty much impossible to do
because<00:02:00.009> these<00:02:01.009> don't<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:01.429> a<00:02:01.460> definite<00:02:03.670> they

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
because these don't have a definite they

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.520 
because these don't have a definite they
don't<00:02:04.850> lock<00:02:05.090> into<00:02:05.360> each<00:02:05.570> other<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.049> definite

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
don't lock into each other in a definite

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.150 
don't lock into each other in a definite
way<00:02:07.269> so<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.840> want<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.410> have<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> guide<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
way so you you want to have a guide and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.940 
way so you you want to have a guide and
luckily<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.209> kind<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.630> one<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.440> this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
luckily you kind of have one in this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.729 
luckily you kind of have one in this
piece<00:02:13.299> because<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.730> circle<00:02:16.730> here

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
piece because this circle here

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.110 
piece because this circle here
corresponds<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.069> inner<00:02:19.250> diameter<00:02:19.940> of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
corresponds to the inner diameter of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.270 
corresponds to the inner diameter of
each<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> floors<00:02:21.170> or<00:02:21.560> at<00:02:21.920> least<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
each of the floors or at least of the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.330 
each of the floors or at least of the
each<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.000> lower<00:02:23.180> floor<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.599> not<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.959> top

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
each of the lower floor is not the top

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.839 
each of the lower floor is not the top
not<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.370> tower<00:02:25.610> top<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.430> were<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.580> take

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
not the tower top so if you were to take

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.680 
not the tower top so if you were to take
your<00:02:29.840> first<00:02:30.019> two<00:02:30.290> wall<00:02:30.530> sections<00:02:31.660> apply<00:02:32.660> glue

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
your first two wall sections apply glue

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.770 
your first two wall sections apply glue
to<00:02:33.290> where<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.099> walls<00:02:34.580> meet<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> brick<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
to where the walls meet at the brick and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.479 
to where the walls meet at the brick and
then<00:02:36.069> place<00:02:37.069> those<00:02:38.260> around<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.950> inner<00:02:40.160> circle

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
then place those around the inner circle

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.479 
then place those around the inner circle
I<00:02:43.720> use<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:44.959> an<00:02:45.230> example<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.950> place

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
I use these as an example and place

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.770 
I use these as an example and place
those<00:02:46.700> around<00:02:46.970> sort<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:49.780> then

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
those around sort of like this and then

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.479 
those around sort of like this and then
let<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.470> glue<00:02:51.709> set<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:55.130> you're<00:02:55.310> going<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
let the glue set then you're going to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.940 
let the glue set then you're going to
have<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:56.120> right<00:02:56.299> curve<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.049> then<00:02:57.319> once

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
have the right curve and then once

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.009 
have the right curve and then once
that's<00:02:58.160> dry<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.510> add<00:02:59.660> another<00:03:00.049> one<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
that's dry you can add another one and

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.069 
that's dry you can add another one and
again<00:03:03.019> you're<00:03:03.410> following<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> curve<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:06.019> you

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
again you're following the curve so you

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.449 
again you're following the curve so you
don't<00:03:06.260> have<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.500> worry<00:03:06.650> about<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.400> then

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
don't have to worry about that and then

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.599 
don't have to worry about that and then
you<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> last<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.690> you're<00:03:08.900> good<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.079> go

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
you do the last and you're good to go

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.009 
you do the last and you're good to go
and<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:11.329> don't<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.720> worry<00:03:11.900> about

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
and you don't have to worry about

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.930 
and you don't have to worry about
whether<00:03:12.410> or<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.739> you've<00:03:13.370> gotten<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> right

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
whether or not you've gotten the right

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.770 
whether or not you've gotten the right
curvature<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.950> inner<00:03:19.100> diameter<00:03:19.609> because

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
curvature on the inner diameter because

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.750 
curvature on the inner diameter because
and<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.840> reason<00:03:20.870> why<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:21.260> matters<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
and the reason why this matters is the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.240 
and the reason why this matters is the
first<00:03:23.000> floor<00:03:23.209> sits<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.720> top<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.590> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
first floor sits on top of this so it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.590 
first floor sits on top of this so it
needs<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.880> able<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.120> fit<00:03:26.269> around<00:03:26.359> that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
needs to be able to fit around that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.990 
needs to be able to fit around that
obviously<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.579> that's<00:03:28.579> not<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> big<00:03:28.940> deal

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
obviously and that's not a big deal

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.670 
obviously and that's not a big deal
because<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.780> know<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.959> can<00:03:30.079> always<00:03:30.230> kind<00:03:30.560> of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
because you know you can always kind of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.800 
because you know you can always kind of
force<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.880> there<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.239> make<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.480> glue<00:03:32.660> do

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
force it in there and make the glue do

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.800 
force it in there and make the glue do
the<00:03:32.959> work<00:03:33.079> but<00:03:34.239> that's<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.329> little<00:03:35.600> less

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
the work but that's a little less

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.220 
the work but that's a little less
possible<00:03:36.470> with<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.670> other<00:03:37.870> floors<00:03:38.870> because

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
possible with the other floors because

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.729 
possible with the other floors because
they're<00:03:39.620> pretty<00:03:39.920> light<00:03:40.850> duty<00:03:41.530> these<00:03:42.530> don't

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
they're pretty light duty these don't

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.839 
they're pretty light duty these don't
you<00:03:42.890> know<00:03:42.980> because<00:03:43.250> they're<00:03:43.400> supposed<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.730> be

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
you know because they're supposed to be

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.550 
you know because they're supposed to be
ruined<00:03:44.090> floors

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
ruined floors

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.229 
ruined floors
they<00:03:45.650> don't<00:03:45.800> have<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.950> lot<00:03:46.099> of<00:03:46.130> contact<00:03:46.760> points

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
they don't have a lot of contact points

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.640 
they don't have a lot of contact points
and<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.870> try<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:49.040> jam<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.730> floor

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
and if you try to really jam the floor

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.040 
and if you try to really jam the floor
into<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.739> walls<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.819> going<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.090> break<00:03:53.300> so

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
into the walls it's going to break so

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.979 
into the walls it's going to break so
you<00:03:54.080> need<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.920> that<00:03:54.980> shape<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:56.450> close<00:03:56.780> as

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
you need to have that shape as close as

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.890 
you need to have that shape as close as
possible<00:03:57.640> from<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.790> get-go<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.780> way

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
possible from the get-go and that way

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.979 
possible from the get-go and that way
you<00:03:59.959> don't<00:04:00.170> have<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.410> modify<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.069> shape<00:04:01.989> in

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
you don't have to modify this shape in

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.580 
you don't have to modify this shape in
order<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.319> make<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.590> fit<00:04:05.140> so<00:04:06.140> that's<00:04:06.349> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
order to make it fit so that's the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.550 
order to make it fit so that's the
that's<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.040> first<00:04:07.310> thing<00:04:07.780> if<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.200> do<00:04:09.380> that

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
that's the first thing if you do that

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.809 
that's the first thing if you do that
right<00:04:09.769> then<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.620> follow<00:04:13.130> this<00:04:13.370> up<00:04:13.430> use

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
right then and you follow this up use

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.520 
right then and you follow this up use
this<00:04:13.970> as<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.180> guide<00:04:14.450> then<00:04:15.170> you're<00:04:15.260> going<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.410> be

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
this as a guide then you're going to be

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.229 
this as a guide then you're going to be
good<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.739> go<00:04:17.799> now<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.859> tower<00:04:19.070> top<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.910> another

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
good to go now the tower top is another

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.250 
good to go now the tower top is another
matter<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:21.049> tower<00:04:21.229> top<00:04:22.690> obviously<00:04:23.690> doesn't

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
matter the tower top obviously doesn't

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.250 
matter the tower top obviously doesn't
fit<00:04:24.500> along<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.370> base<00:04:25.639> it's<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.510> lot<00:04:26.690> wider<00:04:26.930> but

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
fit along this base it's a lot wider but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.930 
fit along this base it's a lot wider but
luckily<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.950> comes<00:04:28.340> with<00:04:28.960> its<00:04:29.960> own<00:04:30.139> floor<00:04:30.560> and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.370 

what<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.060> can<00:04:35.240> do<00:04:35.389> with<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.110> what<00:04:36.350> I

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
what you can do with this and what I

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.830 
what you can do with this and what I
didn't<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:36.860> actually<00:04:37.430> what<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> did<00:04:37.940> was<00:04:38.419> to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
didn't do actually what I did was to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.530 
didn't do actually what I did was to
build<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.229> outer<00:04:39.410> walls<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:40.270> glued<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.300> outer

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
build the outer walls I glued the outer

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.750 
build the outer walls I glued the outer
walls<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.290> then<00:04:42.590> realize<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.430> should

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
walls and then realize that I should

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.060 
walls and then realize that I should
check<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.120> fit<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.630> then<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.169> put<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.770> floor

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
check the fit and then I put the floor

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.150 
check the fit and then I put the floor
and<00:04:46.310> realized<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:48.200> was<00:04:48.380> all<00:04:48.530> wrong<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
and realized that it was all wrong and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.520 
and realized that it was all wrong and
you<00:04:50.000> know<00:04:50.090> I'm<00:04:50.300> trying<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.750> juggle<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.289> four

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
you know I'm trying to juggle all four

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.200 
you know I'm trying to juggle all four
walls<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.250> floor<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.760> trying<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.120> make

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
walls and the floor and trying to make

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.120 
walls and the floor and trying to make
everything<00:04:53.510> fit<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.229> that<00:04:54.680> wasn't<00:04:54.860> going<00:04:55.070> to

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
everything fit and that wasn't going to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.510 
everything fit and that wasn't going to
work<00:04:55.190> what<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:56.000> should<00:04:56.060> do<00:04:56.450> is<00:04:57.370> build<00:04:58.370> the

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
work what you should do is build the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.390 
work what you should do is build the
floor<00:04:58.760> which<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.090> two<00:04:59.240> parts<00:05:00.010> right<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.340> you

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
floor which is two parts right so you

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.580 
floor which is two parts right so you
have<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.820> two<00:05:02.270> sections<00:05:02.510> here<00:05:02.810> so<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.050> glue

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
have the two sections here so you glue

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.340 
have the two sections here so you glue
that<00:05:03.740> together<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.300> let<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.660> dry<00:05:05.930> let<00:05:06.260> it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
that together and and let it dry let it

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.779 
that together and and let it dry let it
set<00:05:06.700> once<00:05:07.700> that's<00:05:07.910> dry<00:05:08.210> add<00:05:09.070> one<00:05:10.070> wall<00:05:10.340> piece

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
set once that's dry add one wall piece

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.810 
set once that's dry add one wall piece
to<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.570> floor<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.130> again<00:05:13.130> make<00:05:13.430> sure<00:05:13.460> that

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
to the floor and again make sure that

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.610 
to the floor and again make sure that
this<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.090> all<00:05:14.240> cleaned<00:05:14.840> up<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.500> know

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
this is all cleaned up and you know

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.020 
this is all cleaned up and you know
filed<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:17.590> ready<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:19.130> assemble<00:05:19.280> before<00:05:19.940> you

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
filed and ready to assemble before you

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.960 
filed and ready to assemble before you
do<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:20.889> assuming<00:05:21.889> you've<00:05:22.039> done<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.460> so

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
do this but assuming you've done that so

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.340 
do this but assuming you've done that so
you're<00:05:23.060> going<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.240> glue<00:05:23.389> on<00:05:23.570> one<00:05:23.840> wall<00:05:24.020> piece

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
you're going to glue on one wall piece

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.740 
you're going to glue on one wall piece
to<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.710> floor<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.490> floor<00:05:25.669> actually<00:05:25.970> has<00:05:26.389> a

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
to the floor the floor actually has a

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.490 
to the floor the floor actually has a
lip<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:28.580> these<00:05:28.940> wall<00:05:29.660> sections<00:05:30.200> sit

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
lip that these wall sections sit

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.850 
lip that these wall sections sit
underneath<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.729> have<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:31.970> very<00:05:32.270> positive

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
underneath so you have a very positive

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.969 
underneath so you have a very positive
gluing<00:05:33.860> point<00:05:34.780> along<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.960> curve<00:05:36.169> there<00:05:36.440> so

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
gluing point along the curve there so

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.340 
gluing point along the curve there so
you<00:05:37.039> let<00:05:37.220> that<00:05:37.400> set<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:38.570> when<00:05:38.990> that's<00:05:39.110> dry

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
you let that set and when that's dry

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.080 
you let that set and when that's dry
then<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:39.740> add<00:05:39.860> another<00:05:40.130> one<00:05:40.340> next<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:40.820> and

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
then you add another one next to it and

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.790 
then you add another one next to it and
then<00:05:41.750> you're<00:05:42.020> going<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.169> glue<00:05:42.350> that<00:05:42.500> along<00:05:42.770> the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
then you're going to glue that along the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.580 
then you're going to glue that along the
lip<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.400> at<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.510> contact<00:05:44.930> point<00:05:45.260> between<00:05:45.320> the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
lip and at the contact point between the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.920 
lip and at the contact point between the
two<00:05:45.860> walls<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.850> nice<00:05:47.030> thing<00:05:47.060> there<00:05:47.690> is

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
two walls and the nice thing there is

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.150 
two walls and the nice thing there is
that<00:05:47.990> if<00:05:48.919> there's<00:05:49.430> any<00:05:50.770> deformity<00:05:51.770> in<00:05:51.979> the

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
that if there's any deformity in the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.390 
that if there's any deformity in the
shape<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:54.500> shouldn't<00:05:54.860> really<00:05:54.979> have<00:05:55.220> any

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
shape you shouldn't really have any

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.930 
shape you shouldn't really have any
problems

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
problems

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.260 
problems
working<00:05:57.940> with<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:59.580> because<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.880> have<00:06:01.060> this

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
working with that because you have this

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.570 
working with that because you have this
nice<00:06:01.510> going<00:06:01.840> point<00:06:01.990> here<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:02.590> you're<00:06:03.460> only

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
nice going point here and you're only

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.610 
nice going point here and you're only
dealing<00:06:04.030> with<00:06:04.210> one<00:06:04.330> other<00:06:04.840> glowing<00:06:05.350> point

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
dealing with one other glowing point

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.620 
dealing with one other glowing point
here<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:06.250> then<00:06:06.970> you<00:06:07.090> just<00:06:07.210> work<00:06:07.389> your<00:06:07.510> way

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
here and then you just work your way

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.659 
here and then you just work your way
around<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.139> by<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.260> time<00:06:08.380> you're<00:06:08.740> done<00:06:08.770> it

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
around and by the time you're done it

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.480 
around and by the time you're done it
should<00:06:10.210> be<00:06:10.510> perfect<00:06:12.000> mine<00:06:13.000> has<00:06:13.770> some<00:06:14.770> gaps<00:06:15.010> and

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
should be perfect mine has some gaps and

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.040 
should be perfect mine has some gaps and
you<00:06:15.850> can<00:06:15.970> see<00:06:16.150> where<00:06:16.389> this<00:06:16.600> doesn't<00:06:16.960> really

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
you can see where this doesn't really

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.740 
you can see where this doesn't really
fit<00:06:17.410> properly<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:18.280> that<00:06:19.120> was<00:06:19.270> because<00:06:19.389> of<00:06:19.570> the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
fit properly and that was because of the

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.240 
fit properly and that was because of the
way<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:19.900> did<00:06:20.230> it<00:06:20.350> which<00:06:20.500> means<00:06:20.680> that<00:06:20.889> now<00:06:21.040> I<00:06:21.070> have

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
way I did it which means that now I have

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.870 
way I did it which means that now I have
to<00:06:21.550> go<00:06:21.669> back<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:21.910> I<00:06:22.240> have<00:06:22.480> to<00:06:25.950> disguise<00:06:26.950> the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
to go back and I have to disguise the

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.570 
to go back and I have to disguise the
problems<00:06:28.389> in<00:06:28.660> other<00:06:29.050> ways<00:06:29.229> by<00:06:29.650> filing<00:06:30.370> and

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
problems in other ways by filing and

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.810 
problems in other ways by filing and
filling<00:06:31.030> and<00:06:31.240> doing<00:06:31.510> lots<00:06:31.630> of<00:06:31.810> things<00:06:32.050> that<00:06:32.380> I

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
filling and doing lots of things that I

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.430 
filling and doing lots of things that I
wouldn't<00:06:33.820> have<00:06:34.000> needed<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.360> do<00:06:34.630> if<00:06:34.990> I<00:06:35.200> just

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
wouldn't have needed to do if I just

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.960 
wouldn't have needed to do if I just
built<00:06:35.620> it<00:06:35.740> properly<00:06:36.100> in<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.280> first<00:06:36.370> place<00:06:36.669> but

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
built it properly in the first place but

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.400 
built it properly in the first place but
but<00:06:37.300> I<00:06:37.330> didn't<00:06:37.660> know<00:06:37.720> and<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:37.960> instructions

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
but I didn't know and the instructions

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.560 
but I didn't know and the instructions
really<00:06:38.680> all<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.370> instructions<00:06:39.700> say<00:06:40.000> is<00:06:40.240> to

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
really all the instructions say is to

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.610 
really all the instructions say is to
build<00:06:41.260> the<00:06:41.410> outer<00:06:41.590> walls<00:06:42.750> and<00:06:43.750> wrap<00:06:44.350> a<00:06:44.380> rubber

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
build the outer walls and wrap a rubber

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.680 
build the outer walls and wrap a rubber
band<00:06:44.919> around<00:06:45.100> it<00:06:45.400> while<00:06:45.729> it<00:06:45.880> dries<00:06:46.030> and<00:06:46.450> that's

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
band around it while it dries and that's

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.210 
band around it while it dries and that's
not<00:06:46.900> going<00:06:47.139> to<00:06:47.229> help<00:06:47.380> that's<00:06:47.740> really<00:06:48.100> not

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
not going to help that's really not

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.710 
not going to help that's really not
going<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.430> help<00:06:48.520> so<00:06:48.729> in<00:06:49.060> this<00:06:49.300> case<00:06:49.479> the

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
going to help so in this case the

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.969 
going to help so in this case the
instructions<00:06:51.570> aren't<00:06:52.570> really<00:06:53.410> doing<00:06:53.650> their

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
instructions aren't really doing their

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.100 
instructions aren't really doing their
job<00:06:54.250> fully<00:06:54.639> because<00:06:55.030> if<00:06:55.330> you<00:06:55.510> just<00:06:55.750> follow<00:06:55.870> the

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
job fully because if you just follow the

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.969 
job fully because if you just follow the
instructions<00:06:56.380> you're<00:06:56.650> going<00:06:56.770> to<00:06:56.830> run<00:06:56.919> into

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
instructions you're going to run into

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.360 
instructions you're going to run into
the<00:06:57.220> same<00:06:57.370> problems<00:06:57.790> that<00:06:57.850> I<00:06:57.970> did<00:06:59.370> something

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
the same problems that I did something

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.490 
the same problems that I did something
else<00:07:00.610> that's<00:07:01.000> not<00:07:01.300> in<00:07:01.450> the<00:07:01.479> instructions<00:07:02.110> that

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
else that's not in the instructions that

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.300 
else that's not in the instructions that
i<00:07:03.930> think<00:07:04.930> was<00:07:05.200> mentioned<00:07:05.560> in<00:07:05.650> white<00:07:05.800> dwarf<00:07:06.100> but

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
i think was mentioned in white dwarf but

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.279 
i think was mentioned in white dwarf but
since<00:07:06.490> i<00:07:06.580> don't<00:07:06.760> actually<00:07:06.910> read<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.840> magazine

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
since i don't actually read the magazine

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.990 
since i don't actually read the magazine
anymore<00:07:08.470> and<00:07:08.950> really<00:07:09.280> only<00:07:09.400> just<00:07:09.520> look<00:07:09.820> at<00:07:09.940> the

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
anymore and really only just look at the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.750 
anymore and really only just look at the

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
pictures i didn't know and that is these

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.360

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.390 
pieces here these are ruined wall

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
sections that you can put in place of

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.270 
sections that you can put in place of
the<00:07:18.760> complete<00:07:19.300> wall<00:07:19.510> sections<00:07:20.020> in<00:07:20.830> order<00:07:21.190> to
