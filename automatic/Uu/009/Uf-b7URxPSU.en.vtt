00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.570 

well<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> finished<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.650> chain<00:00:01.829> errand<00:00:02.100> now<00:00:02.310> and

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
well I finished a chain errand now and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.230 
well I finished a chain errand now and
now<00:00:02.939> it<00:00:03.090> just<00:00:03.120> leads<00:00:03.449> me<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.629> roll<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.080> field

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
now it just leads me to roll the field

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.519 
now it just leads me to roll the field
and<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.330> use<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.660> large<00:00:06.930> roller<00:00:07.290> that's

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
and we use this large roller that's

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.459 
and we use this large roller that's
actually<00:00:07.890> full<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.160> concrete<00:00:08.309> there<00:00:09.349> and<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
actually full of concrete there and the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.980 
actually full of concrete there and the
idea<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.010> we'll<00:00:11.670> roll<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.630> fields<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
idea is that we'll roll the fields that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680 
idea is that we'll roll the fields that
are<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> bit<00:00:13.380> rutti<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.610> I've<00:00:15.210> got<00:00:15.420> Kay's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
are a bit rutti or I've got Kay's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.240 
are a bit rutti or I've got Kay's
footprints<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.100> they've

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
footprints you know where they've

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.150 
footprints you know where they've
poached<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> winter<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.920> level

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
poached it in the winter and that level

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
poached it in the winter and that level
the<00:00:20.340> field<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.680> saw<00:00:22.980> make

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the field out so that when we saw make

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
the field out so that when we saw make
silage<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.730> some<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.720> won't

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
silage or some like that out here won't

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.019 
silage or some like that out here won't
be<00:00:25.289> too<00:00:25.500> bad

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
be too bad

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
be too bad
otherwise<00:00:27.029> you'll<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.300> bumping<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:27.990> over<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
otherwise you'll be bumping all over the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
otherwise you'll be bumping all over the
place<00:00:30.949> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.239> across<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.510> that's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
place you can see across there that's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.470 
place you can see across there that's
been<00:00:34.020> chained<00:00:34.440> arid<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.790> these<00:00:36.090> fields<00:00:36.329> have

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
been chained arid all these fields have

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.040 
been chained arid all these fields have
fertilizer<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:39.270> no<00:00:39.510> sign<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
fertilizer and there's no sign of the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.950 
fertilizer and there's no sign of the
fertilizer<00:00:40.440> left<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> grain<00:00:41.190> now

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
fertilizer left on the grain now

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.209 
fertilizer left on the grain now
that's<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.110> worked<00:00:43.320> its<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.829> which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that's all worked its way in which is a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.020 
that's all worked its way in which is a
bit<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.789> rain<00:00:44.940> we've<00:00:45.090> had<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.420> quite<00:00:45.660> good

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
bit of rain we've had this quite good

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
bit of rain we've had this quite good
anyway<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> crack<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> get

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
anyway and a crack on there and get

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.120 
anyway and a crack on there and get
these<00:00:50.430> fields<00:00:50.879> rolled
