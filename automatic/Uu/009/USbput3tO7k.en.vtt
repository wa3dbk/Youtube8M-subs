00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689

 View 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.519
 despite the German name somewhat 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 complicated when this brand arrived in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 Brazil, the staff had a difficulty 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.650
 in the pronunciation then funk-if cute 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 bush was that it turned into a fusca 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.359
 an unconditional passion to walk in the fusca 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.920
 different because you drive another one 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.750
 kind of car you 're driving a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340
 car driving the fusca you are 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.760
 directing a myth and a will 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 uncontrollable to show this for all 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 world 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's not not binding it's something that you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 defines without receiving a minimum of detail 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 I got in the car Eduardo is proud of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.930
 have the earliest exposure beetle a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 Model 1951 has to put up as 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.660
 worth today with 100 thousand you do not make one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 car price varies according to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.879
 the state of conservation the year of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.190
 manufacturing and especially the value 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 sentimental of the owner who has passed the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.200
 40 years old probably already had 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 a fusca might have been even the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 first car and that's one of the reasons 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 explain such passion to keep one of these 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 even today is the way they 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.259
 they found that remembering the good moments 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 from past 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.689
 audrey 38 years old is a little younger if 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 remembers his father when he was still hitchhiking 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.930
 child in the back seat 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 today has a 1959 model and has already passed 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 Passion for the child Extra time and goal 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.860
 cool things right now I did not have 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.409
 violence had no concern 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.310
 we lived in peace and everything was 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.220
 joy 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.570
 The more original the better it gets to a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.799
 with old parts like doorknobs 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.520
 flashlights and steering wheels 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.210

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.100
 fusca tight little tight
