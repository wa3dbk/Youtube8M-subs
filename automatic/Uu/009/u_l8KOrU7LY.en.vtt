00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.580
 volcanoes as natural systems the 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.860
 volcanoes arise from the energy produced 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.620
 to the interior of our planet through 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.230
 of the rise of magma to the surface in 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.990
 the earth there are three types of factories 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.509
 of magma on divergent edges of plates 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.210
 place where they are created as the case 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.000
 from astor ocean salts to the interior of 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.099
 the plates the hotspots fed by 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.079
 magma is of deep origin generate 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.750
 chains of oceanic islands as is the 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.489
 case of the archipelago of Juan Fernández 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.800
 Finally, there are those 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.050
 magma factories located on edges 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.179
 convergent plates place where 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 subduction occurs that shapes the 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.559
 volcano ismo in chile- the magma is generated 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.449
 by melting rocks in depth 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.429
 after which begins a long 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.070
 process of promotion through the 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.499
 Earth's crust moment when these 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.510
 fades evolve to reach a 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:02.510
 diversity of chemical compositions 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.000
 We also have different types of 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.950
 volcanoes whose morphology is a consequence 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.830
 of the productive styles and their 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.030
 chemical composition a first type is the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.460
 shield volcano 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.890
 Broad base and low slopes 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.170
 slope formed from extensive 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.509
 fluid abbot eruptions 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.360
 An example in Chile is on an island 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.610
 of Easter a second type is the stratum 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.979
 volcano that corresponds to a building 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.050
 volcanic height formed by 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.550
 an alternation of lava and deposits 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.250
 Pyroclastics emitted during 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.280
 successive eruptions an example in chile 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.040
 is the osorno volcano a third type is the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.259
 Composite volcano formed from two or more 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 major emission centers that 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.720
 give a less symmetrical appearance a 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.789
 example in chile is the lashkar volcano a 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.280
 fourth type is that of boilers and domes 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.920
 this is a usual way that they usually have 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 the most viscous magma volcanoes 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.420
 a boiler is a great depression 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.720
 volcanic formed in large eruptions 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.030
 a dome is formed by emission of lava very 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.550
 discs that does not flow and generates shapes 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 bulging an example in chile is the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.440
 volcano chaitén the eruptive styles to 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.960
 they are related to the composition 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 chemistry and types of volcanoes 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.730
 an eruption is the process during 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.820
 which formed volcanic products 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.490
 by liquid solids and gases emerge 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.520
 the surface the eruptions can be 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.020
 of an exclusive or explosive nature and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.780
 classified according to the index of 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.110
 volcanic explosivity that went from 0 to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.240
 8 in intensity the Hawaiian eruptions 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.330
 For example, they are characterized by 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.370
 fluid and low explosive is associated 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.520
 with the manufacture of shield volcanoes 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.800
 the strombolian modality on the other hand 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.590
 It is characterized by violent eruptions 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.920
 with emanation of agglomerates of water 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.270
 scarce ash gases and incandescence 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.850
 initial this modality 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.920
 generates symmetrical volcanoes in eruptions 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 that are often accompanied by 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.650
 simultaneous emission of lava flows 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.140
 Vulcan modality corresponds to 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.060
 moderate violent eruptions by 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.330
 Expulsion of large amount of fragments 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.700
 of rock are usually presented as 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.540
 a series of discontinuous explosions and 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.689
 of short duration those that 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.120
 more can emit lava his things the 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.189
 light eruptions as long as they are 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.469
 very violent eruptions characterized 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.500
 by a large emanation of gases and 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.900
 pyroclasts are usually related to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.209
 high viscosity magma and higher 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.430
 Volatile content with columns 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.890
 high auditory and injection 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.859
 important volumes of pumice and ash 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.290
 that form extensive deposits and these 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.719
 eruptions are able to affect areas 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.569
 located up to thousands of kilometers from 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:53.340
 volcano during an eruption 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.889
 Different processes may occur 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.200
 volcanic surface wash 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.109
 water corresponds to molten material of 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
 high temperature between 700 thousand 200 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.799
 degrees Celsius that is formed when the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 magma rises to the surface shape 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.389
 fluid and progresses by gravity at low 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.159
 velocities pyroclastic flows 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.049
 they correspond to currents 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.000
 strained formed by fragments 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.859
 volcanics of variable size and gases 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.500
 that move on the slopes of a 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.389
 volcano along the depressions it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.590
 characterized by high temperature 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.020
 speed being 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.730
 highly destructive the most 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.070
 originates by the collapse of a column 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.280
 eruptive but also by collapse or 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.410
 explosion of domes cabbages viscous beans the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.600
 art is a flow formed by a large 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.000
 discharge of volcanic fragments whose 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.979
 transport agent is water can be 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.040
 form by sudden melting of ice and 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.570
 snow or during torrential rains 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.400
 dragging unconsolidated material by 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.889
 the channels generating damages and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.570
 floods in its wake another process 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.240
 corresponds to the fall of pyroclasts 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.000
 whose local accumulation can cause 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.100
 roof collapse environmental damage and 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.380
 effects on agriculture in zones 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.580
 distant may generate disturbances in the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.070
 air traffic 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.470
 the finest ash can ascend to the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.229
 upper layers of the atmosphere and be 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.540
 transported thousands of kilometers in the 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.520
 case of large exclusive eruptions and 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.680
 even cooling can occur 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.830
 the land surface and force changes 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.840
 in the climate system volcanoes do not 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.610
 represent only a risk to the 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.680
 human being in his environment but that 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.940
 they also offer benefits among those who 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.430
 highlight tourism 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.470
 and the hot springs sources also 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.980
 you find the energy potential 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.960
 geothermal as a renewable source in the 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.870
 area of ​​mining various types of 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.510
 deposits like gold silver sulfur and 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.390
 iron are associated with old areas 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.490
 volcanic also some products 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.100
 volcanic materials are used as material 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.050
 construction another benefit of the 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.850
 Volcanic activity is intense 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.310
 Soil nutrition and fertilization 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.720
 through the degradation of materials 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.720
 volcanic in the long term
