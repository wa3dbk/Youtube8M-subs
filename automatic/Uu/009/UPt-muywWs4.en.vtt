guides<00:00:10.769> um<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.420> there's<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> lot<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> good<00:00:13.259> stuff

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
guides um so there's a lot of good stuff

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.240 
guides um so there's a lot of good stuff
when<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> fall<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:15.020> vent<00:00:16.020> there<00:00:17.010> is

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
when you fall out of this vent there is

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.120 
when you fall out of this vent there is
a<00:00:17.279> credits<00:00:17.970> thing<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.570> 10000<00:00:19.500> credits<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
a credits thing for 10000 credits and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
a credits thing for 10000 credits and
it's<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:21.060> every<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.660> I've<00:00:22.199> played

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
it's there every time I've played

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
it's there every time I've played
through<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.220> part<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.609> four<00:00:24.000> times<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
through this part like four times and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
through this part like four times and
it's<00:00:25.470> always<00:00:25.769> ten<00:00:26.130> thousand<00:00:26.609> Wow

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's always ten thousand Wow

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.970 
it's always ten thousand Wow
so<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:27.390> probably<00:00:27.810> worth<00:00:28.140> noting<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.769> our

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
so that's probably worth noting on our

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
so that's probably worth noting on our
wiki<00:00:29.179> I<00:00:31.460> maybe<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.820> don't<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.210> Polly<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.719> worth

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
wiki I maybe I don't know Polly is worth

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
wiki I maybe I don't know Polly is worth
noting<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.500> never<00:00:35.460> look<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.239> how<00:00:36.390> much<00:00:36.570> credits

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
noting I never look at how much credits

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.490 
noting I never look at how much credits
are<00:00:37.079> worth<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.129> pick<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.840> yeah<00:00:39.840> like

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
are worth I just pick them up yeah like

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
are worth I just pick them up yeah like
I<00:00:40.770> look<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.280> don't<00:00:41.430> stop<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.840> grab

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I look I don't stop the look I just grab

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.180 
I look I don't stop the look I just grab
them<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.260> fast<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.739> can

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
them as fast as I can

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
them as fast as I can
cuz<00:00:44.760> I've<00:00:44.879> never<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.600> pay<00:00:45.719> attention<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
cuz I've never really pay attention the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.000 
cuz I've never really pay attention the
only<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> did<00:00:47.219> look<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:48.230> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.680> Peng

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
only time I did look was in the Peng

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.470 
only time I did look was in the Peng
treasure<00:00:50.370> room<00:00:50.760> mm-hmm

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
treasure room mm-hmm

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.410 
treasure room mm-hmm
yeah<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.190> like<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.520> especially<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
yeah I like the look especially for the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
yeah I like the look especially for the
note<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.079> power<00:00:55.289> node<00:00:55.590> rooms<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> see

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
note the power node rooms I like to see

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.250 
note the power node rooms I like to see
if<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.180> getting<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.570> return

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
if I'm getting my return

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.889 
if I'm getting my return
oh<00:00:58.430> you're<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.789> look<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.300> too<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
oh you're right I do look there too and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
oh you're right I do look there too and
I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.739> return<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.160> every

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I think you get your return on every

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
I think you get your return on every
single<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.059> we're<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:03.719> close<00:01:03.960> sometimes

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
single one we're pretty close sometimes

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590 
single one we're pretty close sometimes
you<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> bronze<00:01:05.010> semiconductor<00:01:05.970> yeah<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you get a bronze semiconductor yeah and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.550 
you get a bronze semiconductor yeah and
it<00:01:06.720> FS<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.770> true<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:09.229> is<00:01:10.229> true

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it FS you that's true but that is true

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
it FS you that's true but that is true
it's<00:01:10.830> always<00:01:11.100> worth<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> risk<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.939> feel<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.270> 9

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's always worth the risk I feel like 9

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's always worth the risk I feel like 9
out<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> 10<00:01:13.170> times<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.040> more

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
out of 10 times you're gonna get more

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.740 
out of 10 times you're gonna get more
than<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:14.970> money<00:01:15.180> back

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
than your money back

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.289 
than your money back
I<00:01:15.860> love<00:01:16.860> how<00:01:19.520> diamonds<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> most

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I love how diamonds is like the most

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.100 
I love how diamonds is like the most
expensive<00:01:21.570> semiconductor<00:01:22.500> mm-hmm<00:01:23.070> 25,000

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
expensive semiconductor mm-hmm 25,000

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.060 
expensive semiconductor mm-hmm 25,000
diamond<00:01:25.110> does<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.530> conduct<00:01:25.920> electricity

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
diamond does not conduct electricity

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
diamond does not conduct electricity
very<00:01:26.930> well<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.110> all

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
very well at all

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.700 
very well at all
it's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.280> terrible<00:01:29.939> conductor<00:01:30.750> maybe<00:01:31.590> that's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's a terrible conductor maybe that's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
it's a terrible conductor maybe that's
why<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.890> call<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.189> semi<00:01:32.460> conductor<00:01:32.880> Gold

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
why they call it a semi conductor Gold

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
why they call it a semi conductor Gold
is<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> great<00:01:33.990> conductor<00:01:34.759> yeah<00:01:35.759> yeah<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
is a great conductor yeah yeah and it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
is a great conductor yeah yeah and it's
called<00:01:37.110> binding<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> basically<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.340> insulator

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
called binding is basically an insulator

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.039 
called binding is basically an insulator
and<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.579> worth<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> most<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.570> completely

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and but it's worth the most a completely

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
and but it's worth the most a completely
worthless<00:01:43.290> semi<00:01:44.070> conductor<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> should<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
worthless semi conductor it should be

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.899 
worthless semi conductor it should be
diamond<00:01:45.360> ring<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.869> worth<00:01:46.130> 25,000<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.280> go

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
diamond ring is worth 25,000 yeah go

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
diamond ring is worth 25,000 yeah go
ahead<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.180> semi<00:01:48.450> conductor<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.560> drill<00:01:49.920> bits

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
ahead a semi conductor I'm in drill bits

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
ahead a semi conductor I'm in drill bits
or<00:01:50.369> something<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.119> yeah<00:01:51.710> yeah<00:01:52.710> diamond

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
or something like that yeah yeah diamond

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
or something like that yeah yeah diamond
does<00:01:53.340> cut<00:01:53.640> through<00:01:53.880> basically<00:01:54.450> everything

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
does cut through basically everything

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
does cut through basically everything
it's<00:01:55.649> yes<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> Mortal<00:02:00.360> Kombat

I remember in my material science of the
class<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.319> college<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:11.039> worrying<00:02:11.400> about

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
class back in college and worrying about

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.110 
class back in college and worrying about
the<00:02:11.730> structure<00:02:15.620> z1<00:02:16.620> shot<00:02:17.040> from<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.819> seeker

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the structure z1 shot from the seeker

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.820 
the structure z1 shot from the seeker
rifle<00:02:18.239> kills<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> that's<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> great<00:02:19.800> thing

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
rifle kills that that's the great thing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.710 
rifle kills that that's the great thing
about<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.280> seeker<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.880> didn't<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.569> her<00:02:21.690> at

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
about the seeker you didn't see her at

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.759 
about the seeker you didn't see her at
this<00:02:21.900> point<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.599> your<00:02:24.870> live<00:02:25.140> ma'am<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
this point you have your live ma'am I

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.430 
this point you have your live ma'am I
think<00:02:26.069> New<00:02:26.340> Game+<00:02:26.670> oh<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.569> think<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.170> actually

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
think New Game+ oh I think you actually

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:41.270 
think New Game+ oh I think you actually
get<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> seeker<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.220> Chapter<00:02:29.640> five<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:40.280> this

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
get the seeker in Chapter five but this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.949 
get the seeker in Chapter five but this
part<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.970> hard<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.690> don't<00:02:42.870> have

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
part is really hard if you don't have

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.680 
part is really hard if you don't have
enough<00:02:43.230> IMO<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:45.450> imagine<00:02:47.480> because<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
enough IMO I can imagine because I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.449 
enough IMO I can imagine because I
didn't<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:49.290> coming<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.340> my

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
didn't know it was coming like on my

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.509 
didn't know it was coming like on my
first<00:02:50.760> playthru<00:02:51.330> yeah<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.769> oh<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
first playthru yeah it was like oh I

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.759 
first playthru yeah it was like oh I
don't<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> bullet<00:02:54.360> for<00:02:54.630> each<00:02:54.780> dude<00:02:55.110> yeah

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.229 
off without destroying them on me too um
ice<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.459> don't<00:04:17.639> really<00:04:17.790> know<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
ice because I don't really know the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.909 
ice because I don't really know the
enemy<00:04:18.540> names<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.109> they<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.320> tell<00:04:19.769> you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.580 
in-game
you<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.609> hmm<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.060> assume<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
you know hmm I assume that the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.749 
you know hmm I assume that the
achievement<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:23.040> for<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.639> the

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
achievement is for that it's not the
