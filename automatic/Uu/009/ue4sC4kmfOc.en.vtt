00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
throwing down some objects by the way in

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.640 
throwing down some objects by the way in
case<00:00:11.550> you're<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:11.910> cliff<00:00:12.300> sure<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.320> this

case you're not cliff sure how this
could<00:00:14.370> anything<00:00:14.639> works<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:15.570> gonna<00:00:15.660> do

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
could anything works what I'm gonna do

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.670 
could anything works what I'm gonna do
first<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.470> create<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.240> geometry<00:00:18.240> node<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:19.560> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
first is create a geometry node and this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
first is create a geometry node and this
is<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> scene<00:00:20.340> node<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.119> type<00:00:21.630> in

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
is in the scene node I'm gonna type in

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.060 
is in the scene node I'm gonna type in
switch<00:00:22.529> demo<00:00:23.900> let's<00:00:24.900> get<00:00:25.470> rid<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.769> part

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
switch demo let's get rid of that part

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.999 
switch demo let's get rid of that part
here<00:00:28.880> like<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> spell<00:00:30.269> better<00:00:30.800> okay<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.980> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
here like a spell better okay got that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.090 
here like a spell better okay got that
now<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.759> dive<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.530> geometry

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
now if I dive in I'm in the geometry

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340 
now if I dive in I'm in the geometry
level<00:00:35.300> however<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.450> don't<00:00:36.630> need<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> file

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
level however I don't need this file

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.850 
level however I don't need this file
node<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> am<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.809> clear<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.620> into

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
node so what I am is clear to go into

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
node so what I am is clear to go into
here<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.660> make<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
here so what I'm gonna do is make a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.090 
here so what I'm gonna do is make a
platonic<00:00:44.010> solid<00:00:45.620> change<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.739> thing<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
platonic solid change this thing to a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.580 
platonic solid change this thing to a
soccer<00:00:47.370> ball<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.340> then<00:00:50.340> let<00:00:50.640> me<00:00:50.730> create<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
soccer ball and then let me create a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.189 
soccer ball and then let me create a
grid<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.969> I'll<00:00:54.090> copy<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> few<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
grid and I'll copy a few things to the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.090 
grid and I'll copy a few things to the
grid<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.520> let<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.789> create<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
grid and down here let me create a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.560 
grid and down here let me create a
mountain<00:01:00.829> put<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:03.329> that'll

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
mountain put that down here what that'll

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
mountain put that down here what that'll
do<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> grid<00:01:05.000> then<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.390> here

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
do it will just the grid then down here

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
do it will just the grid then down here
I<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> scatter<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:10.200> will

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I want to use a scatter and this will

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.039 
I want to use a scatter and this will
scatter<00:01:10.880> whatever<00:01:11.880> amount<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> points<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
scatter whatever amount of points on the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.870 
scatter whatever amount of points on the
grid<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.740> I'll<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.040> 50<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.200> show<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
grid here I'll use 50 so we show that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
grid here I'll use 50 so we show that
we'll<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> points<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.619> we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
we'll have the points on there if we

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.679 
we'll have the points on there if we
display<00:01:20.070> those<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> copy<00:01:22.110> on

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
display those now I want to do a copy on

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
display those now I want to do a copy on
a<00:01:24.689> copy<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.320> platonic<00:01:25.950> solid<00:01:26.750> onto<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a copy of this platonic solid onto this

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.560 
a copy of this platonic solid onto this
copy<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> let<00:01:28.710> me<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.159> into<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.670> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
copy and let me go back into here so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.020 
copy and let me go back into here so
what<00:01:30.750> I've<00:01:30.900> got

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
what I've got

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.230 
what I've got
using<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> scatter<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> also<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.820> adjust

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
using this scatter and also if I adjust

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
using this scatter and also if I adjust
the<00:01:36.360> mountain<00:01:36.720> maybe<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> 3<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.460> these

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the mountain maybe the 3 we have these

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.749 
the mountain maybe the 3 we have these
at<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.360> locations<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:41.159> great<00:01:41.549> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
at different locations that's great but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
at different locations that's great but
what<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.180> want<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> change<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> objects<00:01:43.729> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
what if we want to change the objects so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
what if we want to change the objects so
I'll<00:01:45.119> put<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.540> another<00:01:46.070> platonic<00:01:47.070> solid<00:01:48.110> throw

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I'll put in another platonic solid throw

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
I'll put in another platonic solid throw
that<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> Utah<00:01:51.360> teapot

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that down here make this a Utah teapot

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
that down here make this a Utah teapot
and<00:01:52.220> here's<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.369> our<00:01:53.399> switch<00:01:53.729> comes<00:01:54.000> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and here's what our switch comes in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.260 
and here's what our switch comes in
handy<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:55.560> gonna<00:01:55.829> throw<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.880> switch<00:01:59.180> let<00:02:00.180> me

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
handy I'm gonna throw in a switch let me

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.550 
handy I'm gonna throw in a switch let me
copy<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.990> here

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
copy that to here

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.080 
copy that to here
let<00:02:02.250> me<00:02:02.340> copy<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.500> I'll<00:02:05.090> send

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
let me copy this to here and I'll send

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
let me copy this to here and I'll send
this<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.780> node<00:02:07.280> now<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.700> have

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
this into that node now what we have

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.449 
this into that node now what we have
here<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> look<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> switch<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.739> 0<00:02:11.129> &amp;

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
here if you look at a switch we have 0 &amp;

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.440 
here if you look at a switch we have 0 &amp;
1

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
1

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.120 
1
now<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> trick<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.140> how<00:02:15.170> do<00:02:15.560> we<00:02:15.620> use<00:02:15.740> this

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
now the trick is how do we use this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.300 
now the trick is how do we use this
switch<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:17.450> pick<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.900> different<00:02:18.080> items<00:02:18.530> back

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
switch to pick the different items back

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.000 
Todd yet another platonic solid in here
this<00:02:23.750> will<00:02:23.990> make<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:26.290> dodecahedron<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
this will make it a dodecahedron that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.210 
this will make it a dodecahedron that
looks<00:02:28.190> fine<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:29.300> merge<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.810> into<00:02:29.870> switch<00:02:30.320> so

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
looks fine we merge that into switch so

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.760 
looks fine we merge that into switch so
now<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.610> switch<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.770> this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
now with a switch we have this one this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.360 
now with a switch we have this one this
one<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.459> one<00:02:34.640> these<00:02:35.060> three<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:37.040> how

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
one in this one these three now how

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.320 
one in this one these three now how
would<00:02:37.550> we<00:02:37.730> get<00:02:38.450> these<00:02:38.660> things<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> switch<00:02:40.330> most

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
would we get these things to switch most

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.140 
would we get these things to switch most
likely<00:02:41.780> how<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.080> we<00:02:42.260> put<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.880> variable<00:02:43.880> in

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
likely how would we put a variable in

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.199 
likely how would we put a variable in
here<00:02:44.660> that's<00:02:44.870> random<00:02:45.459> well<00:02:46.459> we'll<00:02:46.700> go<00:02:46.820> back<00:02:47.030> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
here that's random well we'll go back to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.920 
here that's random well we'll go back to

the copy stop scroll down into stamp and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.810 
the copy stop scroll down into stamp and

we'll<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:23.480> put<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> zero<00:03:24.580> okay<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.610> look<00:03:26.000> what

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
we'll just put a zero okay so look what

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.080 
we'll just put a zero okay so look what
we<00:03:26.209> have<00:03:26.239> here<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.160> variety<00:03:28.730> of

we have here we now have a variety of
items<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.830> think<00:03:30.830> I'll<00:03:31.480> scale<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.660> soccer<00:03:32.930> ball

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
items I think I'll scale the soccer ball

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:43.539 
items I think I'll scale the soccer ball
down<00:03:36.190> scale<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:38.570> one<00:03:38.840> down<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:42.040> as<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.430> can

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
down scale this one down and as you can

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.440 
down scale this one down and as you can
see<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:44.810> now<00:03:44.930> have<00:03:45.519> random<00:03:46.519> objects<00:03:46.940> three<00:03:47.329> of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
see we now have random objects three of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.280 
see we now have random objects three of
them<00:03:47.570> scattered<00:03:48.610> along<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:50.390> grid<00:03:50.750> which<00:03:51.110> has

a<00:03:51.320> mountain<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:53.239> mountain<00:03:53.570> I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
a mountain on it and the mountain I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.530 
a mountain on it and the mountain I
could<00:03:53.900> adjust<00:03:54.670> scale<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.850> up<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.090> down<00:03:56.239> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
could adjust scale that up and down and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.920 
could adjust scale that up and down and
then<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.650> has<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.980> scatter<00:03:58.450> scatter<00:03:59.450> we<00:03:59.780> could

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
then it has the scatter scatter we could

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.870 
then it has the scatter scatter we could
turn<00:04:00.500> up<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.799> hundred<00:04:01.160> make<00:04:01.549> some<00:04:01.760> more
