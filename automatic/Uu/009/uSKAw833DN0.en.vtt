00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.679
Hi, this is the regular CARTOP driving 
test event in the Tsukuba Circuit, Japan.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.079
It is March now. The season of the cherry
blossoms and April is coming soon.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.180
Under this changeable weather,
it is chilly outside today.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.860
While such weather makes 
the turbo system vigorous,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.400
it is a hard time for the tires as 
their temperature does not rise easily.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.780
Nowadays, the high-grip tires 
are popular as Michelin pushes

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.340
Such tires are not good 
in low temperature.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.700
In that sense, these conditions of the tires
will affect the speed and joy of driving.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.780
Anyway, the question is whether money
can buy a fast car?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.160
Right. The answer is Yes.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.880
But it is also true that you 
can get a fun car to drive

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.240
without paying extortionate prices.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.080
You can buy the Porsche GT3 
if you can afford it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.640
But it requires you to have
the skill to enjoy its speed.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.760
Even in this test, it made 
the 01m 01s range very easily and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.820
well indeed a Porsche is great.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.000
There is no other choice but to bow to it.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.440
"It is fast!"

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.660
"As it is a 4WS, it gets 
understeer at the final corner. "

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.270
"I kept accelerating though 
I anticipated the rear to slide.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.520
But in fact it kept understeer. "

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.450
"Then with a little more acceleration,
the rear suddenly slipped . . .

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
So, it is not easy to grasp
the move of the rear. . ."

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.730
"This speed seems to be beyond
the control of the MT.”

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.640
I wish to say that the M3 and M4
of the BMW can possibly beat a Porsche.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.500
Though the engines are 
a turbo-charged 6 cylinder with

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.820
enough potential for a strong output,
after all it is mounted

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.960
on the front and driven by the rear.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.540
By nature of the FR type, when 
the output of the engine is increased,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.680
the car cannot obtain enough
traction at the corner.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.820
Well, I felt the limitation
of the FR in the M3.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
But it is still fun enough to
drive the high performance car

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.060
just like the GT3

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.569
The highlighted car of this 
testing event is Suzuki Alto Turbo.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.220
Its price is only 1.29 million yen.
This is an example showing that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.040
you can get a fun car to drive
without spending too much money.

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.769
Suzuki’s recent models are
very vigorous given that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.509
they have adopted AMT replacing CVT.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.240
As a matter of fact, its weight
range of only being 600kg is

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.640
contributing to it in particular
in the circuit.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.980
"3rd and 4th speed"

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180
"This car is very fast!"

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.139
"So, the tires cannot keep up with it. . .”

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.479
What was difficult to judge
was the Honda Legend.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.000
I mean it is hard to make
a proper comment on that.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.620
The exterior looks like a MK Taxi.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.980
It is a black colored 4 door sedan type.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.650
But actually it can run 
like an athlete though

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.560
obviously not so far as 
to say Usain Bolt.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.079
Its ride might not be the perfect car to run
 on the ordinary road as a luxury car.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.180
But this heavy car of 2 tons turns 
very comfortably on the circuit course.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.560
So I know this is what Honda 
wanted to materialize.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.240
When Honda released the first 
Legend about 30 years ago,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.880
it was criticized that it does not 
turn well with a huge engine on the front.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.880
Having been knocked for 30 years,

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.339
I guess they have a trauma 
on the understeer.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.139
So they tried to improve it 
by installing 4WS or

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.180
by forcibly vectoring it 
when it was in FF layout.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.260
So with this improvement,
I feel like it is time

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.460
to have them released from such trauma.

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.589
"You should not look down on the Legend. . .

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960
It acts unlike a typical big sedan
given its looks. . . "

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.149
"Oh I like this feeling.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.860
Really nice.”

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.710
"After all, it is easy to drive. . ."

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.559
"The brake and handling, 
 shift and sheet. . .

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.470
every one of them are well 
balanced between each other”
