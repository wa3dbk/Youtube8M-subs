00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.879
 [Music] 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.609
 a time 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.650
 Pepa and her friends are in daycare 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.320
 today we are going to make a 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.579
 time capsule 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.919
 [Music] 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.839
 a time capsule serves so that 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.290
 the people who live in the future 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:38.629
 know what the past was like 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.699
 put stuff of today in this box and 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.940
 then we buried it anywhere 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:50.920
 from the patio and so it will stay buried 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.170
 for a long time 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.680
 Now you have to choose what you want 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 I see very well 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.650
 [Music] 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.190

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.590
 He said 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.770
 what you have chosen shows very well 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.490
 how is our daily life 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.890
 is how life will be in the future 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.660
 had a lot you imagine that it will be I think that in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.310
 the future to live on the moon 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.080
 for 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 my friends come to visit me 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.050
 and me but also a space rocket 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:00.520
 and we are going to record a message so that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.520
 see in the future say hello to the future 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.000
 sure you've lived base on the moon 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.459
 that if I am on vacation from Martin and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.459
 balls in space rockets like this 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.300
 fantastic 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.770
 it was almost time to go home 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.770
 parents have come to look for them 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.880
 the time for daddy you have just arrived 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.640
 time to finish the hole and of course 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.740

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.450
 [Music] 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:43.480
 the porridge is digging a hole for 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.480
 enclose the time capsule is already 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.200
 the beach will not stay buried 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.200
 for a long time 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.620
 I can wait that long pimple you're igualita 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.860
 that your father when he was little 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.760
 truth if I remember very well because he 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 he was my student 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.180
 and I taught our dads and your class 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.180
 moms yes 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.129
 when they were little too 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.959
 they made a time capsule so I 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:21.879
 agreement we buried it together with a 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.090
 little tree and I think we buried it more or 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.879
 less around here or cut out one more tree 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.189
 small because this one has passed a lot 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.310
 time the tree has grown from 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.310
 so 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.590
 I think I found something in our 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.590
 time capsule 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:52.790
