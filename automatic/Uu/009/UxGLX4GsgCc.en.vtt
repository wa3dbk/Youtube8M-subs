00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
booster I also could use the regular

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.950 
booster I also could use the regular

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
regular vegetative growth one but I had

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
regular vegetative growth one but I had
good<00:00:18.750> results<00:00:18.930> getting<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.830> explosive

growth with this and I'm hoping it can

do the job this is the melon I featured

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
do the job this is the melon I featured
in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> last<00:00:26.220> episode<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> compared<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.449> the

see<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.890> sister<00:00:47.489> melon<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.329> developing

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
see a sister melon that was developing

to support all these melons at once what

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
to support all these melons at once what
I'm<00:01:01.469> seeing<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.160> about<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:03.329> millons

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I'm seeing is about two millons

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
I'm seeing is about two millons
developing<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> good<00:01:04.979> size<00:01:05.479> maximum<00:01:07.040> here's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
developing to a good size maximum here's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
developing to a good size maximum here's
another<00:01:08.369> example<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> melon<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.780> being

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
another example of a melon that's being

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.560 
another example of a melon that's being
canceled<00:01:10.680> before<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> even<00:01:11.220> gets<00:01:11.369> started

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
canceled before it even gets started

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
canceled before it even gets started
basically<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.590> lush<00:01:13.979> green<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> pre

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
basically if it's not lush green the pre

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.450 
basically if it's not lush green the pre
melon<00:01:15.150> fertilized<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.189> going

melon fertilized or not it's not going

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.710 
melon fertilized or not it's not going
anywhere<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> shrivel<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
anywhere it's just going to shrivel up

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.990 
anywhere it's just going to shrivel up
and<00:01:18.840> die<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> underside<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and die and this is the underside of a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
and die and this is the underside of a
leaf<00:01:21.030> nearby<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.290> dead<00:01:22.770> adult

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
leaf nearby it's got some dead adult

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
leaf nearby it's got some dead adult
spider<00:01:23.460> mites<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:25.020> number<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.590> has

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
spider mites on it my number one has

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
spider mites on it my number one has
many<00:01:26.340> other<00:01:26.549> melons<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.330> size<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.869> well

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
many other melons like this size as well

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.760 
many other melons like this size as well
but<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.490> they'll<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.450> pause

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
but I think they'll all be put on pause

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
but I think they'll all be put on pause
hormonal<00:01:31.770> e<00:01:31.979> until<00:01:32.509> one<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:33.540> two<00:01:33.840> melons

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hormonal e until one or two melons

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
hormonal e until one or two melons
developed<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> their<00:01:34.799> maximal<00:01:35.280> size<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
developed to their maximal size and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
developed to their maximal size and
here's<00:01:37.020> another<00:01:37.140> good<00:01:37.500> example<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:38.040> one

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
here's another good example this one

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.969 
here's another good example this one
just<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:38.970> pollinated<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.799> healthy

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
just got pollinated so it looks healthy

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
just got pollinated so it looks healthy
now<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.119> within<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.509> few<00:01:42.689> days<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
now but you know within a few days it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
now but you know within a few days it
could<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.320> shriveling<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> dying<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
could be shriveling up and dying this is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.139 
could be shriveling up and dying this is
on<00:01:45.720> vine<00:01:46.079> 3<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.890> asymmetrical<00:01:47.759> melon

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
on vine 3 it's an asymmetrical melon

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.600 
on vine 3 it's an asymmetrical melon
that's<00:01:48.420> developing<00:01:49.350> bigger<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> left

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's developing bigger on the left

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.210 
that's developing bigger on the left
side<00:01:50.850> our<00:01:51.119> left<00:01:51.420> compared<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
side our left compared to the right it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.730 
side our left compared to the right it
doesn't<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.899> symmetrical<00:01:54.899> axis<00:01:55.409> with

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
doesn't have a symmetrical axis with

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.910 
doesn't have a symmetrical axis with
both<00:01:56.670> ends<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.290> melon<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
both ends and this is the melon that I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.359 
both ends and this is the melon that I
featured<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:00.930> episodes<00:02:01.409> ago<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
featured I think two episodes ago you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.959 
featured I think two episodes ago you
know<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.930> biggest<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.969> up

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
know this one was the biggest and up

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119 
know this one was the biggest and up
here<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.649> believe

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
here you can see the one that I believe

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.639 
here you can see the one that I believe
was<00:02:08.340> pecked<00:02:08.610> by<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> bird<00:02:09.030> once<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:10.110> I've<00:02:10.229> seen

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
was pecked by a bird once but I've seen

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
was pecked by a bird once but I've seen
no<00:02:10.860> bird<00:02:11.039> activity<00:02:11.340> since<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.450> don't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
no bird activity since so I don't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199 
no bird activity since so I don't
know<00:02:13.049> what<00:02:13.230> happened<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.769> sure<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:15.000> can't

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
know what happened for sure I just can't

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.430 
know what happened for sure I just can't
think<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.599> anything<00:02:15.810> else<00:02:16.019> that<00:02:16.230> could<00:02:16.319> have

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
think of anything else that could have

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.399 
think of anything else that could have
caused<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.739> damage<00:02:17.659> here's<00:02:18.659> another<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.200> on

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
caused that damage here's another one on

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.059 
caused that damage here's another one on
vine<00:02:19.739> three<00:02:20.569> this<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.900> vine<00:02:22.170> two<00:02:22.530> it's

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
vine three this is on vine two it's

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.890 
vine three this is on vine two it's
slightly<00:02:23.489> bigger<00:02:23.790> than<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:24.000> golf<00:02:24.239> ball<00:02:24.629> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
slightly bigger than a golf ball and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.460 
slightly bigger than a golf ball and
this<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.769> also<00:02:26.069> vine<00:02:26.700> two<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> believe<00:02:27.470> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
this is also vine two I believe it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.830 
this is also vine two I believe it's
about<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.769> same<00:02:28.950> size<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.909> size<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.659> golf

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
about the same size he size of a golf

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
about the same size he size of a golf
ball<00:02:30.900> slightly<00:02:31.319> bigger<00:02:31.620> I've<00:02:32.519> got<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.879> spider

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
ball slightly bigger I've got the spider

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180 
ball slightly bigger I've got the spider
mite<00:02:33.390> problem<00:02:33.840> largely<00:02:34.019> under<00:02:34.440> control<00:02:34.829> with

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
mite problem largely under control with

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.940 
mite problem largely under control with
regular<00:02:35.610> Springs<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.329> 0.6%<00:02:37.200> hydrogen

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
regular Springs of 0.6% hydrogen

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.280 
regular Springs of 0.6% hydrogen
peroxide<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.700> I've<00:02:38.849> noticed<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
peroxide but I've noticed that some of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.190 
peroxide but I've noticed that some of
these<00:02:40.349> leaves<00:02:40.680> near<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.610> bigger

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
these leaves near the bigger

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
these leaves near the bigger
fast-developing<00:02:43.200> melons<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.159> shriveling<00:02:44.700> up

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
fast-developing melons are shriveling up

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.420 
fast-developing melons are shriveling up
and<00:02:45.000> dying<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.079> think<00:02:46.379> that's<00:02:47.129> because

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and dying so I think that's because

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.729 
and dying so I think that's because
there's<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.849> lack<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> micronutrients<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:49.379> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
there's a lack of micronutrients in the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.369 
there's a lack of micronutrients in the
soil<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.670> why<00:02:50.879> I'm<00:02:51.239> fertilizing<00:02:52.049> if

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
soil and that's why I'm fertilizing if

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.740 
soil and that's why I'm fertilizing if
you<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.519> lush<00:02:53.790> leaves<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.480> it's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you see lush leaves like this it's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.789 
you see lush leaves like this it's
because<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.379> retrieved<00:02:56.810> some<00:02:57.810> vine<00:02:58.109> ends<00:02:58.500> from

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
because I retrieved some vine ends from

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.039 
because I retrieved some vine ends from
the<00:02:59.430> other<00:02:59.640> side<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.239> balcony<00:03:00.599> that's

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the other side of this balcony that's

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.259 
the other side of this balcony that's
serving<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> trellis<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.459> brought<00:03:03.120> them

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
serving as a trellis and brought them

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.089 
serving as a trellis and brought them
over<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.750> side<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.319> all<00:03:04.349> those<00:03:04.859> leaves

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
over to this side so all those leaves

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.270 
over to this side so all those leaves
look<00:03:05.370> amazing<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.409> this<00:03:07.409> is<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.040> mess

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
look amazing and this is just a mess

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.119 
look amazing and this is just a mess
here<00:03:08.609> for<00:03:08.970> vine<00:03:09.299> too<00:03:09.629> but<00:03:10.500> I'm<00:03:10.590> looking<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.010> get

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
here for vine too but I'm looking to get

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.369 
here for vine too but I'm looking to get
some<00:03:11.190> trellis<00:03:11.790> action<00:03:12.180> set<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.690> behind<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
some trellis action set up behind the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.699 
some trellis action set up behind the
lines<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.159> balcony<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.940> soon<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
lines on this balcony pretty soon and

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.839 
lines on this balcony pretty soon and
that<00:03:16.709> means<00:03:16.950> there's<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.669> lot

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
that means there's going to be a lot

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.059 
that means there's going to be a lot
more<00:03:17.880> opportunity<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:18.799> photosynthesis<00:03:19.799> and

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
more opportunity for photosynthesis and

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.550 
more opportunity for photosynthesis and
vegetative<00:03:20.639> growth<00:03:20.669> I<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.209> rescue<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.139> lot<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
vegetative growth I can rescue a lot of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800 
vegetative growth I can rescue a lot of
these<00:03:22.730> straggler<00:03:23.730> vine<00:03:24.090> offshoots<00:03:24.660> that

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
these straggler vine offshoots that

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.229 
these straggler vine offshoots that
haven't<00:03:25.230> been<00:03:25.349> doing<00:03:25.590> well<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> very

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
haven't been doing well this is a very

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.509 
haven't been doing well this is a very
interesting<00:03:27.540> story<00:03:28.139> from<00:03:28.530> vine<00:03:28.829> one<00:03:29.069> it's<00:03:29.340> had

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
interesting story from vine one it's had

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.430 
interesting story from vine one it's had
this<00:03:29.730> thin<00:03:30.090> sickly<00:03:30.720> offshoot<00:03:31.139> for<00:03:31.349> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
this thin sickly offshoot for the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.430 
this thin sickly offshoot for the
longest<00:03:31.799> time<00:03:31.919> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:33.060> lifted<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:33.959> up<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
longest time and I lifted it up and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.860 
longest time and I lifted it up and
draped<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.099> over<00:03:35.250> an<00:03:35.639> equally<00:03:36.269> thin<00:03:36.599> vine

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
draped it over an equally thin vine

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.229 
draped it over an equally thin vine
offshoot<00:03:37.349> from<00:03:37.379> vine<00:03:37.769> 3<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.730> see<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.090> can

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
offshoot from vine 3 to see if we can

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.949 
offshoot from vine 3 to see if we can
get<00:03:39.419> anything<00:03:39.629> going<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.379> get<00:03:41.160> into<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> Sun

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
get anything going and get into the Sun

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.300 
get anything going and get into the Sun
and<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.109> had<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> pleasant<00:03:43.530> development<00:03:44.160> it's
