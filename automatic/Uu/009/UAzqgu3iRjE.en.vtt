 of great magnitude and with great color because so that in them it is once

 plus one more anniversary of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.460
 already in our independence the police have changed much more than two years 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.870
 since the time of bolivar in this whole process that you remember to see 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.760

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.550
 future that Colombia needs towards is a police mg 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.710
 projects in the mood although they technological development or roasted with a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 high power without any technological capacity 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.479
 of great magnitude where it is to which they pay the needs of the community 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.300
 The truth is that today 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.840
 we have military forces normally different from what we had 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.240
 two or three or four years ago 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.130
 thousands of military 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.630
 boonen quick bush and with intelligence disciplines I saw very much 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.230
 the commitment to this beaten earth as is colombia 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.870
 we reaffirm our independence 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.310
 independence gave us freedom 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.000
 we conform the state as a nation 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.140
 nor the military and arica forces 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.110
 that of preserving that freedom another of the foreigners therefore is important 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.320
 that the citizenship before Colombia in general 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 know here we have the military forces of the army and the police 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 who have also fought to preserve their independence 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 is his message to all the soldiers of Christ of the borders of our 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 country
