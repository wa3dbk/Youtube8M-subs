00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
that I feel like more so than things

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.710 
that I feel like more so than things
that<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.620> talk<00:05:09.890> about<00:05:10.100> when<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.640> know<00:05:10.790> what

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
that you talk about when you know what

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.750 
that you talk about when you know what
the<00:05:11.840> other<00:05:11.960> one<00:05:12.140> does<00:05:12.170> so<00:05:12.650> intimately<00:05:13.070> it's

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
the other one does so intimately it's

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.980 
the other one does so intimately it's
more<00:05:13.940> about<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.240> things<00:05:14.420> that<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.690> really

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
more about the things that you really

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.630 
more about the things that you really
don't<00:05:15.170> have<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.470> say<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:15.890> know<00:05:16.100> there's<00:05:16.520> an

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
don't have to say you know there's an

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.100 
don't have to say you know there's an
understanding<00:05:17.030> without<00:05:17.390> having<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.870> say<00:05:18.080> a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
understanding without having to say a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.780 
understanding without having to say a
whole<00:05:18.320> lot<00:05:18.350> so<00:05:18.680> that<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:18.920> there's<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.580> level

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
whole lot so that that there's a level

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.090 
whole lot so that that there's a level
of<00:05:19.940> underlying<00:05:20.750> support<00:05:21.290> that<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.740> get<00:05:21.920> as<00:05:22.070> a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
of underlying support that you get as a

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.250 
of underlying support that you get as a
result<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.730> which<00:05:22.910> is<00:05:23.060> it's<00:05:23.810> pretty<00:05:23.990> cool

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
result of that which is it's pretty cool

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.600 
result of that which is it's pretty cool
because<00:05:24.440> it's<00:05:24.680> not<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:25.040> not<00:05:25.160> easy<00:05:25.370> out<00:05:25.580> there

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
because it's not it's not easy out there

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.550 
because it's not it's not easy out there
and<00:05:26.120> then<00:05:26.390> when<00:05:26.480> your<00:05:26.600> son<00:05:26.990> came<00:05:27.200> along<00:05:27.410> and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
and then when your son came along and

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.930 
and then when your son came along and
