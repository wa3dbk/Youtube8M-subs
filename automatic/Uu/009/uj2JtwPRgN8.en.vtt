may<00:02:11.420> be<00:02:11.480> compared<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:13.090> future<00:02:14.090> armor<00:02:14.450> in

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
may be compared to this future armor in

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.660 
may be compared to this future armor in
that<00:02:14.720> case<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.440> call<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.010> impact<00:02:16.460> case

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
that case I will call it the impact case

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.240 
that case I will call it the impact case
from<00:02:16.790> now<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.440> quick<00:02:18.680> circle<00:02:19.040> case

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
from now on and so the quick circle case

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.780 
from now on and so the quick circle case
is<00:02:19.490> really<00:02:20.210> really<00:02:20.390> cheap<00:02:21.310> looking<00:02:22.310> compared

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
is really really cheap looking compared

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.260 
is really really cheap looking compared
to<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.030> impact<00:02:23.750> case<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.670> impact<00:02:26.120> case

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
and has much more protection than the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.890 
and has much more protection than the
quick<00:02:32.030> second<00:02:32.330> case<00:02:32.450> which<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.720> pretty

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
quick second case which is pretty

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.110 
quick second case which is pretty
obvious<00:02:33.110> by<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.530> looks<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.940> see

to<00:03:45.410> your<00:03:45.470> phone<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.790> bunch<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.090> scratches

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
to your phone just a bunch of scratches

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.570 
to your phone just a bunch of scratches
on<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> case<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:49.280> it's<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.459> really

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
on the case and I think it's a really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.820 
on the case and I think it's a really
good<00:03:49.670> addition<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.360> they<00:03:50.570> put<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.050> that

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
good addition that they put that that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.360 
good addition that they put that that
they<00:03:51.980> gave<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.340> with<00:03:52.519> case<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.040> saw

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
they gave that with case and if you saw

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.920 
they gave that with case and if you saw
at<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.670> start<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.090> video<00:03:56.209> there<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.630> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
at the start of this video there is a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.220 
at the start of this video there is a
stand<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:58.550> case<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.330> if<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.660> well<00:04:00.080> you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
stand on this case so if you well you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.580 
stand on this case so if you well you
have<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.560> have<00:04:00.709> some<00:04:00.950> really<00:04:02.140> tiny<00:04:03.140> hands<00:04:03.440> to

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
have to have some really tiny hands to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.650 
have to have some really tiny hands to
pull<00:04:03.800> this<00:04:03.890> up<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:04.220> i<00:04:04.280> managed<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.090> you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
pull this up but i managed to and you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.720 
pull this up but i managed to and you
can<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:05.989> is<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.620> creates<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> small

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
can see that is it creates like a small

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.910 
can see that is it creates like a small
stand<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:08.930> keep<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.530> like<00:04:09.769> that

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
stand so you can keep it for like that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.330 
stand so you can keep it for like that
while<00:04:10.100> you're<00:04:10.220> watching

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
while you're watching

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.309 
while you're watching
of<00:04:11.400> our<00:04:11.550> movies<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.360> right<00:04:12.660> now<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:12.989> tipping

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
of our movies so right now it's tipping

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.500 
of our movies so right now it's tipping
over<00:04:13.440> because<00:04:13.950> my<00:04:14.250> table<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.879> not<00:04:15.180> really<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
over because my table is not really a

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
over because my table is not really a
flat<00:04:15.930> table<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:17.280> also<00:04:17.669> i<00:04:17.730> was<00:04:17.850> out<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
flat table and also i was out the the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.110 
flat table and also i was out the the
clock<00:04:19.799> that's<00:04:19.979> on<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.489> actually<00:04:20.729> also

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
clock that's on it is actually also

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.879 
clock that's on it is actually also
really<00:04:21.540> bumpy<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.049> that's<00:04:22.560> why<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.770> would

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
really bumpy and that's why it would

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.620 
really bumpy and that's why it would
fall<00:04:23.070> over<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.940> put<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> flat

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
fall over but if you put it on a flat

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.200 
fall over but if you put it on a flat
hard<00:04:25.080> table<00:04:25.590> nothing<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.520> won't<00:04:26.790> fall<00:04:27.000> over

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
hard table nothing it won't fall over

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.710 
hard table nothing it won't fall over
its<00:04:27.540> really<00:04:27.840> stable<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:29.190> seems<00:04:30.060> unstable<00:04:30.419> but

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
its really stable it seems unstable but

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.189 
its really stable it seems unstable but
it's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.229> really<00:04:31.650> good<00:04:32.389> case<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:33.750> also<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
it's a really good case and also the

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.530 
it's a really good case and also the
stand<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.560> also<00:04:34.740> pretty<00:04:34.860> good<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.790> also<00:04:36.090> it's

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
stand is also pretty good and also it's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.180 
stand is also pretty good and also it's
not<00:04:36.720> really<00:04:36.960> protruding<00:04:37.560> out<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.860> anywhere

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
not really protruding out of anywhere

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.340 
not really protruding out of anywhere
because<00:04:38.610> there<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:39.300> two<00:04:39.510> ridges<00:04:39.870> on<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.110> side

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
because there are two ridges on the side

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.710 
because there are two ridges on the side
and<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.520> bet<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.090> back<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.660> that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
and on the bet on the back and that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.360 
and on the bet on the back and that
really<00:04:43.290> makes<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.860> feel<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.070> there's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
really makes you feel like there's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.820 
really makes you feel like there's
nothing<00:04:44.700> there<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.169> pretty<00:04:46.560> good

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
nothing there and so it's pretty good

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.280 
nothing there and so it's pretty good
and<00:04:47.070> also<00:04:47.430> as<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:47.760> said<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.210> really<00:04:48.419> creepy<00:04:48.750> so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
and also as I said it's really creepy so

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.320 
and also as I said it's really creepy so
in<00:04:49.650> conclusion<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:50.430> think<00:04:50.700> this<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:50.970> one<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
in conclusion I think this is one of the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.300 
in conclusion I think this is one of the
best<00:04:51.570> cases<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.350> have<00:04:52.560> ever<00:04:52.740> owned<00:04:53.010> for

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
best cases that I have ever owned for

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.360 
best cases that I have ever owned for
the<00:04:53.430> for<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.450> LG<00:04:54.870> g3<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.530> think<00:04:56.100> it's<00:04:56.220> pretty

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
the for the LG g3 I think it's pretty

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.969 
the for the LG g3 I think it's pretty
good<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:58.139> you<00:04:58.290> want<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.680> buy<00:04:58.919> this
