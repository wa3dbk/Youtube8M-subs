it's<00:00:00.359> unlikely<00:00:00.840> that<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:02.010> grotto<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.520> going

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
it's unlikely that the grotto is going

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.749 
it's unlikely that the grotto is going
to<00:00:02.939> exist<00:00:03.360> for<00:00:03.840> another<00:00:03.929> 50<00:00:04.500> years<00:00:04.710> which<00:00:05.580> is

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
to exist for another 50 years which is

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.750 
to exist for another 50 years which is
sad<00:00:06.029> because<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:07.760> extremely

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
sad because it's it's extremely

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.990

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:32.569 
important and interesting piece of
history<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.090> makin<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:31.380> took<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> while<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.040> me

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
history for makin it took a while for me

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.330 
history for makin it took a while for me
to<00:00:33.380> travel<00:00:34.380> through<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> woods<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.160> when<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
to travel through the woods but when I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.270 
to travel through the woods but when I
found<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.500> looked<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:38.340> looked<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:40.280> maybe

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
found it it looked it looked like maybe

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.420 
found it it looked it looked like maybe
an<00:00:41.550> old<00:00:41.700> shrine<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.450> some<00:00:42.629> sort

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
an old shrine of some sort

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.860 
an old shrine of some sort
so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:46.460> started<00:00:47.460> doing<00:00:47.700> research<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.210> figure

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so I started doing research to figure

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
so I started doing research to figure
out<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.129> led<00:00:50.250> me

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
out what it was and that's what led me

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600 
out what it was and that's what led me
to<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.610> research<00:00:51.329> topic<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.610> thesis

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to my research topic from my thesis

there<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.640> long<00:01:20.640> hiatus<00:01:21.259> before<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.500> moved

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there was a long hiatus before I moved

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
there was a long hiatus before I moved
into<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.850> present<00:01:24.390> location<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.500> Walt<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
back during the early part of the 20th

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.830 
back during the early part of the 20th
century<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.369> by<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> variety<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.659> people

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
century and used by a variety of people

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
century and used by a variety of people
but<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.770> always<00:01:52.979> heard<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.799> jesuit<00:01:55.799> monks

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
but we always heard the jesuit monks

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.970 
but we always heard the jesuit monks
that<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.329> walk<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
that would walk there and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.870 
that would walk there and
and<00:01:59.900> recreate<00:02:00.900> them<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.550> think<00:02:02.760> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and recreate them I don't think the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.360 
and recreate them I don't think the
actual<00:02:03.840> grotto<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.590> well<00:02:04.800> known<00:02:04.950> at<00:02:05.190> all

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.460 
I think one of the best things you could
do<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:49.910> prevent<00:04:50.270> demolition<00:04:50.870> deterioration

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
do to prevent demolition deterioration

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.460 
do to prevent demolition deterioration
is<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.070> make<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.400> more<00:04:52.669> accessible<00:04:53.380> instead<00:04:54.380> of

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
is to make it more accessible instead of

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.129 
is to make it more accessible instead of
being<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:55.210> hidden<00:04:56.210> place<00:04:56.570> where<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:56.930> have<00:04:57.020> to

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
being a hidden place where you have to

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.510 
being a hidden place where you have to
trust<00:04:57.380> pass<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.800> get<00:04:57.979> that<00:04:58.130> invites

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
trust pass to get that invites

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.240 
trust pass to get that invites
inappropriate<00:04:59.360> uses<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.870> vandalism<00:05:00.229> if<00:05:00.979> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
inappropriate uses and vandalism if you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.070 
inappropriate uses and vandalism if you
had<00:05:01.490> somebody<00:05:01.789> that<00:05:02.000> was<00:05:02.120> inclined<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.900> make<00:05:03.020> a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
had somebody that was inclined to make a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.170 
had somebody that was inclined to make a
gift<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.800> city<00:05:03.979> for<00:05:04.220> generations<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:05.030> come

gift to the city for generations to come

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.830 
gift to the city for generations to come
to<00:05:05.630> preserve<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.169> as<00:05:06.320> green<00:05:06.650> space<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:07.400> or

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
to preserve it as green space and or

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.190 
to preserve it as green space and or

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
enhanced more the possibilities of it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.640

an<00:05:18.830> issue<00:05:18.919> of<00:05:19.310> what<00:05:20.240> looks<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.539> be<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.720> great

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
an issue of what looks to be a great

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
graffiti on the rocks that would be a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.140 
graffiti on the rocks that would be a
real<00:05:39.889> concern<00:05:40.070> for<00:05:40.490> us<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:40.789> we<00:05:40.970> were

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
real concern for us if we were

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.790 
real concern for us if we were
maintaining<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.050> I'd<00:05:42.169> love<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.470> be<00:05:42.560> part

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
maintaining it and I'd love to be part

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.779 
maintaining it and I'd love to be part
of<00:05:42.919> a<00:05:43.070> team<00:05:43.970> or<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.720> small<00:05:45.349> campaign<00:05:45.830> to<00:05:46.520> see<00:05:46.729> if

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
of a team or a small campaign to see if

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.279 
of a team or a small campaign to see if
we<00:05:46.910> couldn't<00:05:47.150> Brettler<00:05:47.570> donation<00:05:48.139> of<00:05:48.199> the

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
we couldn't Brettler donation of the

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.830 
we couldn't Brettler donation of the
property<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.919> become<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.280> public<00:05:49.699> park<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.270> think

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
property to become a public park I think

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.790 
property to become a public park I think
that<00:05:50.990> be<00:05:51.139> useful<00:05:51.620> in<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.830> area<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:54.470> I

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
that be useful in that area and and I

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.110 
that be useful in that area and and I
think<00:05:55.070> it'd<00:05:55.190> be<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.340> great<00:05:55.520> way<00:05:55.789> to<00:05:55.820> preserve

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
think it'd be a great way to preserve

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.659 
think it'd be a great way to preserve
the

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669
