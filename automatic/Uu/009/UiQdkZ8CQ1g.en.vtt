needle<00:00:44.870> threader<00:00:45.080> you<00:00:45.800> can't<00:00:46.070> use<00:00:46.339> this<00:00:46.640> with

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
needle threader you can't use this with

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.079 
needle threader you can't use this with
a<00:00:47.269> twin<00:00:48.050> needle<00:00:48.430> because<00:00:49.430> there's<00:00:49.640> two<00:00:49.879> eyes

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
a twin needle because there's two eyes

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.939 
a twin needle because there's two eyes
and<00:00:50.449> again<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.839> just<00:00:50.960> goes<00:00:51.170> underneath<00:00:51.710> that

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
and again that just goes underneath that

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.340 
and again that just goes underneath that
now<00:00:52.280> these<00:00:52.519> two<00:00:52.879> top<00:00:53.150> threads<00:00:53.510> will<00:00:54.140> wrap

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
now these two top threads will wrap

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.469 
now these two top threads will wrap
around<00:00:54.739> my<00:00:54.949> bobbin<00:00:55.339> thread<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.909> create<00:00:56.449> a

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
around my bobbin thread and create a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.820 
around my bobbin thread and create a
little<00:00:56.659> bit<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.839> giving<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.290> stitch<00:00:57.559> which<00:00:57.799> is

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
little bit of giving the stitch which is

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.850 
little bit of giving the stitch which is
why<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.309> is<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> great<00:00:58.970> way<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.239> sew<00:00:59.870> jersey

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
a two centimeter seam allowance this

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.210 
a two centimeter seam allowance this

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
like and then I have pinned from the

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.200 
like and then I have pinned from the
right<00:01:14.960> side<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:15.830> as<00:01:16.040> I<00:01:16.190> need<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.880> twin<00:01:17.180> needle

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.720 
right side so as I need the twin needle
to<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.260> outside<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.340> on<00:01:19.550> the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
to be on the outside not on the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.730 
to be on the outside not on the
underneath<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.660> need<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.170> stitch<00:01:21.410> from<00:01:21.440> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.580 
underneath so I need to stitch from the
outside<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.490> use<00:01:23.150> my<00:01:23.480> seam<00:01:23.930> allowance<00:01:24.320> groove

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
and start sewing as I sew I'm going to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.400 
and start sewing as I sew I'm going to
lightly<00:01:29.260> stretch<00:01:30.260> my<00:01:31.100> project<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.090> that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
lightly stretch my project so that

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.560 
lightly stretch my project so that
there's<00:01:33.410> plenty<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:34.070> give<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.700> my<00:01:35.000> stitching

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570

there's plenty of give in my stitching
and<00:01:35.720> that's<00:01:35.870> because<00:01:36.050> this<00:01:36.170> particular

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
and that's because this particular

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.929 
and that's because this particular
fabrics<00:01:37.100> got<00:01:37.250> quite<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> lot<00:01:37.760> of<00:01:37.790> rebound

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:58.070 

just<00:01:41.939> lightly<00:01:42.210> stretching<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:57.080> so

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
just lightly stretching as I go so

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.350 
just lightly stretching as I go so
here's<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.560> finished<00:01:58.799> hem<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.520> I've<00:01:59.670> got<00:02:00.030> two

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
here's my finished hem and I've got two

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
here's my finished hem and I've got two
rows<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.899> parallel<00:02:01.619> stitching<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
rows of parallel stitching on the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.149 
rows of parallel stitching on the
outside<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.509> garment<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:04.920> plenty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
outside of my garment and there's plenty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
outside of my garment and there's plenty
of<00:02:05.340> stretch<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.179> stitches<00:02:06.479> won't<00:02:06.810> be

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
of stretch so these stitches won't be

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
of stretch so these stitches won't be
snapping<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:08.429> garments<00:02:08.880> not<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.269> feel

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
snapping my garments not going to feel

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.680 
snapping my garments not going to feel
too<00:02:09.660> tight<00:02:10.019> when<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> turn<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.310> over<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
too tight when I turn this over what you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.530 
too tight when I turn this over what you
see<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:14.190> underneath<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.209> bobbin

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
see is that the underneath the bobbin

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.320 
see is that the underneath the bobbin
threads<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.170> kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> almost<00:02:17.280> zigzags

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
threads have kind of almost zigzags

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.600 
threads have kind of almost zigzags
and<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.720> allow<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.380> fabric<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.130> keep

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and they allow the fabric to keep

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.949 
and they allow the fabric to keep
stretching<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.190> great<00:02:23.730> way<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.330> sew

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
stretching and that's a great way to sew

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.490
