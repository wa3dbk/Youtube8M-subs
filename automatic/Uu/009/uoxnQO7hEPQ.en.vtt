00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.840
 I as a professional as a teacher one 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.840
 strange from cable experience the sex 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.149
 in a certain way and the dance is worked with 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.149
 the sexual parts of the person 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:59.660
 you seduce yourself you love yourself 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.720
 same and you need sat and same that what 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.860
 you can transmit dancing by pretending not to 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.800
 exists 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.160
 dancing pretending a pain or dancing 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 faking fatigue is part of your 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 power 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 for me to love flowers in the sauce 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.480
 sexual 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.480
 nothing while the Arab 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.230
 to be part of the most modern part 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:00.080
 we usually mix the rhythms more 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.420
 pop jazz and some level touches 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.110
 musicals with Latinos because 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.560
 coincidentally there are you could enter 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 to levels of movement in dance 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.950
 Arabic and you could use Latin steps 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.130
 call me salsa call merengue call 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.750
 reggaeton enters a very subtle function 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.540
 and maybe even the same viewer 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 you would not notice but you are using a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 23 latin 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.100
 which is what we were brought up with 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.100
 U.S 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.980
 for another pair of wine hits 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.520
 dance with love sex through 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.290
 dance with your partner that's why you work 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.300
 the sensual part through the room 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.480
 Minerva is the same as when 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.480
 work as a couple 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 you work in certain numerous scenes 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 criminal cases 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 I have an inheritance I dance 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.819
 it hurts me to read I dance my mom died 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.939
 I dance 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.420
 because that default is activated is 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.489
 transforming that love of yours to give it not to 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.439
 through dance but that's what the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.370
 art I believe that art in general is 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.370
 a matter of age
