you guys have been like in this series
and<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.210> enjoy<00:00:09.480> making<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.900> video<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.500> I

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and I enjoy making the video so I

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.070 
and I enjoy making the video so I
decided<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> keep<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.519> doing<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.870> got<00:00:13.049> a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
decided to keep on doing it and I got a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.530 
decided to keep on doing it and I got a
suggestion<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> should<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> clones

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
suggestion that I should have the clones

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720 
suggestion that I should have the clones
completely<00:00:16.350> surrounded<00:00:16.859> by<00:00:16.980> separatist

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
completely surrounded by separatist

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.290 
completely surrounded by separatist
droids<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.740> took<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.580> i<00:00:20.880> did<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
droids so I I took that and I i did it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.660 
droids so I I took that and I i did it
and<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:22.050> has<00:00:22.230> been<00:00:22.670> extraordinarily

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and this video has been extraordinarily

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
and this video has been extraordinarily
hard<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> make<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:25.140> tried<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
hard to make I have tried this in so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.240 
hard to make I have tried this in so
many<00:00:26.400> variations<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.619> every<00:00:28.619> time<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
many variations but every time I do it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
many variations but every time I do it
either<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> clones<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.420> wiped<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
either the clones are wiped out just so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.370 
either the clones are wiped out just so
fast<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.890> droids<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.719> just<00:00:33.719> wiped<00:00:34.140> out

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
fast or the droids are just wiped out

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.069 
fast or the droids are just wiped out
extremely<00:00:35.160> fast<00:00:35.399> too<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.870> see

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
extremely fast too but as you can see

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
extremely fast too but as you can see
the<00:00:37.260> droids<00:00:37.800> are<00:00:38.010> completely<00:00:38.579> surrounding

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the droids are completely surrounding

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.660 
the droids are completely surrounding
the<00:00:39.059> clones<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.980> platoons<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.399> sort<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the clones with platoons of just sort of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.720 
the clones with platoons of just sort of
nine<00:00:42.300> regular<00:00:43.140> droids<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.489> couple

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
nine regular droids and then a couple

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
nine regular droids and then a couple
SMG<00:00:45.360> sort<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> scattered<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.460> they

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
SMG sort of scattered in there and they

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.150 
SMG sort of scattered in there and they
surround<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.570> pretty<00:00:49.020> well<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
surround them pretty well and then the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.270 
surround them pretty well and then the
clones<00:00:50.460> themselves<00:00:51.090> they've<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:52.250> sort<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
clones themselves they've got a sort of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
clones themselves they've got a sort of
like<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> tiered<00:00:53.969> thing<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.780> here

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
like a tiered thing going on here

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.819 
like a tiered thing going on here
they've<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.890> LMGs<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.000> row<00:00:57.829> laying

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
they've got LMGs in the first row laying

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
they've got LMGs in the first row laying
down<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.399> we've<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.550> rifles<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> second

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
down then we've got rifles in the second

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
down then we've got rifles in the second
row<00:01:01.440> crouching<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.579> smgs<00:01:03.300> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
row crouching and then we have smgs in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
row crouching and then we have smgs in
the<00:01:03.660> third<00:01:03.930> row<00:01:04.170> standing<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the third row standing up with the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
the third row standing up with the
captain<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> middle<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.890> yeah<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.880> hope

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
captain in the middle so yeah I hope

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.230 
captain in the middle so yeah I hope
this<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.540> works<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> i<00:01:11.310> hope<00:01:11.520> i<00:01:11.880> don't

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
this one works out and i hope i don't

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 
this one works out and i hope i don't
have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.799> reorganize<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.220> battle<00:01:14.580> again

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
have to reorganize this battle again

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
have to reorganize this battle again
because<00:01:15.210> i've<00:01:15.360> also<00:01:15.600> crashed<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.500> game<00:01:16.799> like

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because i've also crashed this game like

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
because i've also crashed this game like
three<00:01:17.340> times<00:01:17.610> trying<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.570> two

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
three times trying to do this with two

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.920 
three times trying to do this with two
massive<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.290> battles<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.450> hoping<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
massive of battles so I'm hoping this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
massive of battles so I'm hoping this
one<00:01:22.140> works<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.680> let's<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.670> happens<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
one works so let's see what happens it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
one works so let's see what happens it's
press<00:01:24.570> start<00:01:25.310> alright<00:01:26.310> clones<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
press start alright clones right off the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
press start alright clones right off the
bat<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.479> killing<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:29.159> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
bat are killing a lot of them but I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
bat are killing a lot of them but I
think<00:01:29.430> clones<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.880> taking<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.329> losses<00:01:30.540> too

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
think clones are taking some losses too

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.890 
think clones are taking some losses too
oh<00:01:31.610> shit<00:01:32.610> yep<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.450> seeing<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.750> less

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
oh shit yep we're seeing a lot less

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.069 
oh shit yep we're seeing a lot less
green<00:01:34.350> lasers<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:35.420> Wow<00:01:37.400> clones<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:39.079> wiped

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
green lasers now Wow clones just wiped

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
green lasers now Wow clones just wiped
out<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> bat<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:42.170> no

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
out right off the bat there no

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
out right off the bat there no
competition<00:01:44.540> all<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:46.100> well<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> guess<00:01:47.490> what

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
competition all right well I guess what

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
competition all right well I guess what
we<00:01:48.210> should<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.570> now<00:01:48.810> let's<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.130> into<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
we should do now let's go back into this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.569 
we should do now let's go back into this
and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.409> should<00:01:52.619> spawn<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> some<00:01:53.369> new

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and then we should spawn in some new

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:01.150 
and then we should spawn in some new
clones<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:57.680> have<00:01:58.680> them

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.410 

go<00:02:02.160> ahead<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.820> attack<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> separatists<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.150 

they<00:02:09.420> heard<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.630> their<00:02:10.020> buddies<00:02:10.350> were<00:02:10.590> were

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
they heard that their buddies were were

bodies to whatever all right clones are

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.150 
bodies to whatever all right clones are
coming<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> rescue<00:02:40.080> here<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:42.860> huge<00:02:43.860> amount

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 
clones how many died in that little last

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:31.670 
clones how many died in that little last
and<00:07:27.229> three<00:07:28.849> that's<00:07:29.849> so<00:07:30.149> sad<00:07:30.509> a<00:07:30.899> couple<00:07:31.409> died
