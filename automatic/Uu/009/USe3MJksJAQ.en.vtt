to them as well and there's also a lot
of<00:00:41.250> extracurricular<00:00:42.120> activities<00:00:42.810> being

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of extracurricular activities being

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.480 
of extracurricular activities being
offered<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.840> also<00:00:45.840> being<00:00:46.080> such<00:00:46.440> a

offered here and also being such a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.740 
offered here and also being such a
metropolitan<00:00:47.490> city<00:00:48.320> that's<00:00:49.320> why<00:00:49.530> i<00:00:49.560> chose<00:00:49.890> UCL

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 

I<00:00:54.870> chose<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:56.460> work<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> brain<00:00:57.090> because

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I chose to work on the brain because

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
I chose to work on the brain because
even<00:00:58.290> though<00:00:58.470> it's<00:00:59.040> always<00:00:59.400> captured

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
even though it's always captured

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
even though it's always captured
people's<00:01:00.000> imagination<00:01:00.900> and<00:01:01.200> people<00:01:02.010> are

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
people's imagination and people are

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
people's imagination and people are
wondering<00:01:02.610> about<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.270> mind<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.780> brain

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
wondering about the mind and the brain

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.770 
wondering about the mind and the brain
and<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> works<00:01:05.270> there's<00:01:06.270> still<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.750> little

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and how it works there's still so little

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
and how it works there's still so little
that<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.370> how<00:01:08.490> what

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that we know about it about how what

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.180 
that we know about it about how what
goes<00:01:09.479> wrong<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:11.070> goes

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
goes wrong or what what actually goes

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.820 
goes wrong or what what actually goes
right<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> what<00:01:13.200> fascinates<00:01:13.740> me

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
right with it so that what fascinates me

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.790 
right with it so that what fascinates me
because<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.310> sort<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> breath<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.800> areas

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
because there's sort of breath of areas

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.460 
because there's sort of breath of areas
you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> brain<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.470> discover

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you can work in the brain and discover

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can work in the brain and discover
more<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.210> because<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.360> also<00:01:21.540> an

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
more and because it's also an

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
more and because it's also an
ever-increasing<00:01:22.170> population<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.610> suffering

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
ever-increasing population and suffering

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.719 
ever-increasing population and suffering
from<00:01:24.240> neurological<00:01:24.630> diseases<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.710> it'd<00:01:26.700> be

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
from neurological diseases and it'd be

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.620 
from neurological diseases and it'd be
nice<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:28.040> offer<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.430> practical<00:01:30.000> solutions

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
nice to offer some practical solutions

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
nice to offer some practical solutions
and<00:01:30.810> answers<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.259> these<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:31.979> what

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and answers to these people because what

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
and answers to these people because what
we<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> moment<00:01:33.660> is<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.410> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we know at the moment is so little and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
we know at the moment is so little and
so<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.759> lot<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.240> needs<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.630> done<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so a lot more needs to be done and so I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920 
so a lot more needs to be done and so I
thought<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.810> I'd

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
thought that's the you know what I'd

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.040 
thought that's the you know what I'd
like<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.820> starting<00:01:41.820> when<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.899> started

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
like to do starting when I just started

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.469 
like to do starting when I just started
