of uncertainty so what people do is this
they<00:01:43.430> go<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.730> corner<00:01:44.180> they<00:01:44.810> find<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.110> corner

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
they go to a corner they find a corner

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.460 
they go to a corner they find a corner
that's<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:46.130> they<00:01:46.250> like<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.080> they<00:01:48.080> do<00:01:48.140> it

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
that's that they like and they do it

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
that's that they like and they do it
again<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.550> again<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.240> again<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:50.900> again

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
again and again and again and again

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.930 
again and again and again and again
because<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.620> way<00:01:51.770> they<00:01:51.950> know<00:01:51.980> exactly<00:01:52.220> how

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
because that way they know exactly how

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.720 
because that way they know exactly how
the<00:01:53.150> corner<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.780> just<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.550> racer<00:01:55.550> on<00:01:55.580> a

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
the corner is just like a racer on a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.640 
the corner is just like a racer on a
racetrack<00:01:55.970> those<00:01:56.510> are<00:01:56.720> like<00:01:56.960> all<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.440> real

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
racetrack those are like all the real

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.200 
racetrack those are like all the real
racers<00:01:58.070> they<00:01:58.190> have<00:01:58.310> those<00:01:58.400> entire<00:01:58.790> racetracks

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
racers they have those entire racetracks

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.790 
racers they have those entire racetracks
memorized<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.200> then<00:02:00.320> they<00:02:00.410> keep<00:02:00.500> going

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
memorized and then they keep going

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.590 
memorized and then they keep going
around<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.160> around<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.520> around<00:02:01.610> every<00:02:02.420> corner

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
around it around it around every corner

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.810 
around it around it around every corner
they<00:02:02.810> know<00:02:02.930> exactly<00:02:03.350> how<00:02:03.530> fast<00:02:03.800> exactly<00:02:04.730> what

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
they know exactly how fast exactly what

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.630 
they know exactly how fast exactly what
kind<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.000> lean<00:02:05.240> angle<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:07.220> that's

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
kind of lean angle and then and that's

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.120 
kind of lean angle and then and that's
so<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.360> do<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.020> on<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> long<00:02:09.500> mountain<00:02:09.800> road

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
so to do that on a long mountain road

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.920 
so to do that on a long mountain road
it's<00:02:10.399> not<00:02:10.460> really<00:02:10.790> feasible<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.780> do

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's not really feasible so what you do

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.450 
it's not really feasible so what you do
is<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.170> go<00:02:12.380> back<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.620> forth<00:02:12.980> over<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
is you just go back and forth over the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.690 
is you just go back and forth over the
same<00:02:13.730> freaking<00:02:14.390> corner

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
same freaking corner

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.040 
same freaking corner
that's<00:02:16.090> what<00:02:16.240> I've<00:02:16.300> been<00:02:16.420> doing<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.870> little

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
that's what I've been doing for a little

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.650 
that's what I've been doing for a little
while<00:02:17.170> now<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.620> mean<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.030> bikers<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:19.569> they

while now I mean the bikers there they

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.150 
while now I mean the bikers there they

of<00:02:31.720> guys<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.620> me<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:34.540> taking<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.990> corners

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
of guys like me we're taking the corners

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:47.920 
of guys like me we're taking the corners
you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.420 

and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.020> got<00:02:49.470> my<00:02:49.620> knee<00:02:49.680> down<00:02:49.890> there<00:02:50.129> on<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and I got my knee down there on that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.320 
and I got my knee down there on that
corner<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.410> didn't<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.489> that's<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
corner and I didn't get it and that's I

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.990 
corner and I didn't get it and that's I
think<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.410> first<00:02:55.680> three<00:02:56.489> or<00:02:56.519> four<00:02:56.610> times

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
think the first three or four times

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.410 
think the first three or four times
doing<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.230> corner<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.180> didn't<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.269> my<00:03:00.360> knee

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
doing that corner I didn't get my knee

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.820 
doing that corner I didn't get my knee
down<00:03:00.690> even<00:03:00.989> though<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.140> was<00:03:01.260> trying<00:03:01.440> why

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
down even though I was trying why

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.860 
down even though I was trying why
because<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.700> was<00:03:02.819> my<00:03:02.940> first<00:03:03.150> three<00:03:03.599> times

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
because I it was my first three times

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.130 
because I it was my first three times
doing<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.430> last<00:03:05.610> two<00:03:05.849> weeks<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
doing it in the last two weeks but the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.750 
doing it in the last two weeks but the
fourth<00:03:07.349> time<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.800> fifth<00:03:08.010> time<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.489> sixth

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
fourth time the fifth time the sixth

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.300 
fourth time the fifth time the sixth
time<00:03:08.970> knee<00:03:09.510> down<00:03:09.750> knee<00:03:10.019> down<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.620> so

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
time knee down knee down you don't so

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.530 
time knee down knee down you don't so
that's<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.580> need<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.239> find<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
that's we need to do you just find a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.320 
that's we need to do you just find a
corner<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.489> safe<00:03:14.489> corner<00:03:14.970> with<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> bit<00:03:15.299> of

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
corner a safe corner with a bit of

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.140 
corner a safe corner with a bit of
runoff<00:03:15.890> it's<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.040> entirely<00:03:17.340> safe<00:03:17.760> because

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
runoff it's not entirely safe because

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.190 
runoff it's not entirely safe because
right<00:03:18.599> now<00:03:18.720> I'm<00:03:18.810> gonna<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.019> doing<00:03:19.170> a

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
right-hander on that corner so if I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.620 
right-hander on that corner so if I
wipeout<00:03:20.880> I'm<00:03:20.970> gonna<00:03:21.120> slide<00:03:21.360> into<00:03:21.510> the

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
according because once you like once you

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.610 
according because once you like once you
keep<00:04:04.150> doing<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> corner<00:04:04.810> like<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.379> builds

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
keep doing a corner like that it builds

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.780 
keep doing a corner like that it builds
up<00:04:05.680> your<00:04:05.739> confidence<00:04:06.040> because<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.580> know<00:04:06.670> what

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
up your confidence because you know what

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.130 
up your confidence because you know what
to<00:04:06.879> expect<00:04:06.970> you've<00:04:07.330> done<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.599> corner<00:04:07.930> like

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
to expect you've done the corner like

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.830 
to expect you've done the corner like
six<00:04:08.530> times<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.040> row<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.390> helps<00:04:10.659> build

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
six times in a row so it helps build

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.750 
six times in a row so it helps build
confidence<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.980> then<00:04:12.250> once<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.519> start

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
confidence and then once you start

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.430 
confidence and then once you start

getting comfortable with extremely

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.009 
getting comfortable with extremely
angles<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.730> feel<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.030> your<00:04:16.419> knee<00:04:16.720> or

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
angles and and the feel of your knee or

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
foot rubbing against the pavement then

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.490 
foot rubbing against the pavement then
it<00:04:19.989> allows<00:04:20.199> you<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.530> do<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.829> on<00:04:21.010> other<00:04:21.579> corners

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
it allows you to do it on other corners

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.800 
it allows you to do it on other corners
that<00:04:23.500> are<00:04:23.650> less<00:04:23.860> practice<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.520> it's<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.690> all
