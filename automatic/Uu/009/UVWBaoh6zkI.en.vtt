 worked for her shoe factory with grandma 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.150
 it is also not very much and it is all luck 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.210
 insulted him

 getting worse now everything is not so 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 bad it was the only thought 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 which calmed him but once he 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 late to his train and after that his 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 tired of enduring all his failures and soon 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 he went to the library 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.830
 where I read all the possible books about 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.450
 trains that night he found one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 It is the train on which he was late 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.070
 he disassembled every part of his brake 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.470
 mechanism studied it and then all over again 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630
 gathered he knew that if he saw like this 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
 that memory works how it worked 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 against him the next day this train 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.049
 new drove his stop 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.510
 only this time he got off the rail 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.549
 making a terrible mayhem this case with 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.350
 by train very pleased Humphrey and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.080

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.920
 reassemble the ATM and go around 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.960

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.939
 hunter did not know that 6 ATMs were 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 cameras are built in and the next day it 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.500
 Gotham 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.170
 he decided to ride in this and and with no one 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690
 saying goodbye he wanted to sail away on a boat but 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 unfortunately his boat is carried away by the flow 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.040
 drew attention to the clock tower 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.019
 who froze arrows and Humphrey decided 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.030
 fix the clock but during repair 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.010
 there was a nuisance which led to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.090
 chain reaction and all major facilities 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.400
 on the roofs of houses 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.799
