really<00:04:14.090> good<00:04:14.329> out<00:04:14.389> there<00:04:14.540> was<00:04:14.870> Daniel<00:04:15.290> Riordan

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
really good out there was Daniel Riordan

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.050 
really good out there was Daniel Riordan
in<00:04:15.709> his<00:04:15.859> practice<00:04:16.280> he<00:04:16.310> actually<00:04:16.669> had<00:04:16.910> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.210 
in his practice he actually had the
fastest<00:04:17.510> time<00:04:17.750> out<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.349> his<00:04:18.530> session<00:04:19.039> there

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
fastest time out of his session there

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.370 
fastest time out of his session there
and<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.519> was<00:04:19.639> over<00:04:19.789> Josh<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.299> move<00:04:20.449> on<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.720> 450

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
and that was over Josh to move on a 450

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.110 
and that was over Josh to move on a 450
a<00:04:21.709> couple<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.310> other<00:04:22.430> guys<00:04:22.580> Jake<00:04:22.849> Weimer

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
a couple of the other guys Jake Weimer

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.750 
a couple of the other guys Jake Weimer
he<00:04:23.360> looks<00:04:23.539> good<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.930> his<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.620> Justin<00:04:25.610> Brayton

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
he looks good on his and Justin Brayton

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.900 
he looks good on his and Justin Brayton
on<00:04:25.969> the<00:04:26.090> new<00:04:26.180> factory<00:04:26.599> KTM<00:04:27.229> for<00:04:27.710> MDK<00:04:28.190> he

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
on the new factory KTM for MDK he

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.210 
on the new factory KTM for MDK he
fast<00:04:29.150> on<00:04:29.390> his<00:04:29.450> f<00:04:29.630> but<00:04:29.810> i<00:04:29.960> think<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.620> 450<00:04:31.160> is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
fast on his f but i think the 450 is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.350 
fast on his f but i think the 450 is
still<00:04:31.430> going<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.640> have<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.790> little<00:04:31.940> bit<00:04:32.180> of<00:04:32.210> an

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
still going to have a little bit of an

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.090 
still going to have a little bit of an
advantage<00:04:32.570> because<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.110> do<00:04:33.350> have<00:04:33.500> quite<00:04:34.040> a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
advantage because we do have quite a

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.500 
advantage because we do have quite a
long<00:04:34.280> straight<00:04:34.610> away<00:04:34.790> if<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.970> remember<00:04:35.300> years

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
long straight away if you remember years

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.870 
long straight away if you remember years
past<00:04:35.840> year<00:04:36.050> sometimes<00:04:36.710> they<00:04:36.890> go<00:04:37.070> across<00:04:37.610> the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
past year sometimes they go across the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.370 
past year sometimes they go across the
stadium<00:04:38.120> it's<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.540> little<00:04:38.570> shorter<00:04:39.050> we're

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
stadium it's a little shorter we're

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.260 
stadium it's a little shorter we're
going<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.710> long<00:04:39.890> way<00:04:39.920> across<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.610> stadium<00:04:40.850> so

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
going the long way across the stadium so

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.700 
going the long way across the stadium so
I<00:04:41.300> think<00:04:41.390> the<00:04:41.630> 450s<00:04:42.290> are<00:04:42.380> going<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.680> a

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
I think the 450s are going to have a

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.680 
I think the 450s are going to have a
little<00:04:42.860> bit<00:04:43.100> more<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.310> advantage<00:04:43.850> but<00:04:44.000> when<00:04:44.600> we

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
little bit more to advantage but when we

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.780 
little bit more to advantage but when we
head<00:04:44.840> outside<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.620> think<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.190> lights<00:04:46.400> guys<00:04:46.670> are

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
head outside I think the lights guys are

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.740 
head outside I think the lights guys are
going<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:46.970> have<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.120> little<00:04:47.240> bit<00:04:47.420> more<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.630> an

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
going to have a little bit more of an

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.940 
going to have a little bit more of an
advantage<00:04:47.990> because<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.320> real<00:04:48.500> tight<00:04:48.710> back

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
advantage because it's real tight back

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.050 
advantage because it's real tight back
there<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:49.850> going<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.000> be

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
there it's really going to be

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.250 
there it's really going to be
interesting<00:04:50.450> putting<00:04:50.660> those<00:04:50.750> bikes<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.170> the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
interesting putting those bikes on the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.960 
interesting putting those bikes on the
same<00:04:51.440> track<00:04:51.680> at<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.890> same<00:04:52.040> time<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.490> all<00:04:52.760> kicks
