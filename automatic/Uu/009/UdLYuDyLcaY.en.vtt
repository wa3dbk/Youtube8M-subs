00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.640
 God is the love 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.619
 with me we try you a bit 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.940
 to take with you if it finally works 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.940
 I know but we try 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150
 we catch 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.470
 on 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.650
 recognize 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.630
 right from the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.220
 become two Germans 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.220
 The End 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.220
 cutouts 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 I will be a children's town 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.110
 wanted to do some pictures 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:20.780
 saved like I have one 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.950
 Forgotten is carl zeiss caramel 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.320
 macchiato 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.830
 this is what spring somehow 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:55.880
 everyone on instagram has what's called that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:59.770
 thing a foul on his rock 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.770
 sunglasses but the lahn is greener 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.700
 tea or 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.980
 that 's better because it has me - 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.980
 fischer do I want movies 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 sportiness 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.570
 because we have nothing to do and we just do it 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.300
 times things calm and tried on 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.920
 Unfortunately, the hunting costs 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.950
 are fully booked 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.710
 I think we have decided 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 not the part and the money and now 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:52.540
 Finally, buy me yesterday 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.040
 unlikely so hey people anyway 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.520
 as you can see I'm back 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.400
 home 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.380
 that's not wanted I have something here 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.600
 pulled down because I thought 14 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.620
 maybe a bit cold and 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.700
 I could somehow stand or something 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.710
 so please do not think so 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.210
 In any case, it is already halfway 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.230
 seven or so I'm already one 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.670
 a bit longer break 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.720
 i have darmstadt at home and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.610
 then I was still short with mine 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.260
 family in the city even knows yet 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.990
 spontaneously there I was 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.840
 actually not much I have done 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.780
 moment my flag 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.360
 I have just the whole picture here 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
 imported and I am currently 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.920
 Edit probably look at it 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.100
 still medinas must loose flaky 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:45.520
 to catch up with about five exactly 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.400
 and otherwise what about the flop I hope 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080
 you liked it otherwise still a 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.530
 nice day we will see each other in the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.530
