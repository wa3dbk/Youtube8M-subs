00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 he's a moto.it guy 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.970
 nothing we are here hyde latvia that is not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.960
 It was that day to put anything 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.020
 because in any case we are on board 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.749
 pretty good speed there was 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.919
 track was very difficult today is a lot 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:25.890
 occupied very technical and nothing I had a 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.349
 good feeling with the bike and his 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 I could do what I wanted 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 by now I found myself at the first corner 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 with charlie and I lost several 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.250
 positions and then slipped made a 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 error and I recovered well I finished 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 ninth in the second hand a little starting 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.699
 that I often drove lost past 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 point I drove quiet maybe too much 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.270
 quiet 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.780
 I made a mistake on some channels 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 game back first from the ramp 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.570
 spent lost the hand and I fell 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.840
 strong enough then I tried to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 back on the bike because I felt one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 hit but I was very sick 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 I felt no more than three curves e 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 sincerely because watching evening has 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.440
 resting on the platform can imagine 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.910
 there really is a bad situation 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.090
 so scared also because but a lot 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.190
 over the back 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.039
 I was afraid then I retired and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.610
 after 20 minutes luckily I risked 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.340
 feel the leg I made 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.510
 now there is a great but too much for 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.180
 now in two three days words words 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.100
 if he has placed however I seek from 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.280
 look positive there it is 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.880
 speed sky and we saw where though 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.220
 often characters are know you have it 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 let's say a little more luck is more less 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.310
 mistakes
