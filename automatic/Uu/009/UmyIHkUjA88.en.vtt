00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:09.170
 now consider the stator device 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.349
 the basis for it is a sheet 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.200
 textolite 12 millimeters thick in 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.789
 which drilled through holes 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.749
 for 9 coils and rotor hubs external 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.380
 25 mm diameter coils and 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:29.839
 internal matching with the diameter of the magnets 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.020
 the iron coils themselves and thereby 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.900
 perform the dual function monito 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.570
 conductive core and reduction 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.700
 sticking when moving magnets from one 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.260
 coil to another 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.120
 which reduces the power of moving 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.230
 generator coil wound wire 0 5 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.010
 130 turns each millimeter 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.270
 all winding directions are the same 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.490
 since the generator is three phase 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.970
 then each phase accounts for 3 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.329
 coils inside one phase coil always 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.869
 connect in series but they themselves 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.719
 phase 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.450
 can be connected either by a star or 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.929
 triangle triangle give less 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.170
 voltage but more current star contrary 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.060
 more voltage and less current more 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.780
 in detail about the benefits of this or that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.889
 connections and their clear scheme 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.719
 can be found on my site under the heading 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:32.329
 generators are another important point when 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.969
 the coils will be glued to the stator and you 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.649
 proceed with their connections tag 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.889
 each one by phase number 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.560
 how I did it then it will be clear that 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:43.490
 they do not stand for nothing but 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.299
 alternately alternate 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.520
 its not tangled in the final workmanship 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.700
 stator is a rectification circuit 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.639
 AC to DC with 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.689
 Diodes I personally used ready 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:00.709
 diode bridge 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.590
 They are widely available compact and convenient to 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:07.750
 work a detailed diagram of their connection 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 look at my website and in conclusion 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 before building a generator 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.250
 decide 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.800
 what voltage current should it produce 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.900
 to power your load and which ones 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.069
 momentum you can with it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.890
 ensure remember what they will be higher 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.060
 the higher the output voltage and current 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.060
 your generator
