fight Itachi I'd shared his power would
Naruto<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.750> see<00:04:25.960> where<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.650> unique

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
Naruto so we see where this is a unique

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.210 
Naruto so we see where this is a unique
connection<00:04:27.810> because<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.530> touches<00:04:29.770> power

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
connection because if it touches power

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.730 
connection because if it touches power
is<00:04:30.490> one<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:30.940> same<00:04:31.210> then<00:04:32.140> therefore<00:04:32.410> this

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
is one and the same then therefore this

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.880 
is one and the same then therefore this
power<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.220> Naruto<00:04:33.640> could<00:04:33.820> literally<00:04:34.240> um

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
power in Naruto could literally um

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.790 
power in Naruto could literally um
damage<00:04:35.890> sauce<00:04:36.190> cases<00:04:36.610> eyes<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.230> see<00:04:38.530> where

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
damage sauce cases eyes so we see where

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.330 
damage sauce cases eyes so we see where
this<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.400> unique<00:04:39.730> evidence<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.540> arm<00:04:41.340> Sasuke

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
this is unique evidence that arm Sasuke

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.040 
this is unique evidence that arm Sasuke
might<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:42.700> stand<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.970> chance<00:04:43.000> against<00:04:43.540> Naruto

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
might not stand a chance against Naruto

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.230 
might not stand a chance against Naruto
but<00:04:44.920> who<00:04:45.100> knows<00:04:45.310> if<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.670> power<00:04:45.940> might<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.210> a

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
but who knows if this power might be a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.960 
but who knows if this power might be a
connection<00:04:46.390> between<00:04:46.810> Itachi<00:04:47.640> Itachi<00:04:48.640> could

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
connection between Itachi Itachi could

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.480 
connection between Itachi Itachi could
have<00:04:49.060> put<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.240> power<00:04:49.480> inside<00:04:49.720> Naruto<00:04:50.340> then<00:04:51.340> he

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
have put a power inside Naruto then he

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.690 
have put a power inside Naruto then he
transferred<00:04:51.940> his<00:04:52.000> power<00:04:52.630> inside<00:04:53.380> Sasuke<00:04:54.040> so

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
transferred his power inside Sasuke so

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.460 
transferred his power inside Sasuke so
if<00:04:54.880> Sasuke<00:04:55.330> would<00:04:55.450> sway<00:04:55.810> from<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.080> path<00:04:56.290> of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
if Sasuke would sway from the path of

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.160 
if Sasuke would sway from the path of
good<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:57.370> power<00:04:57.640> within<00:04:57.970> Naruto<00:04:58.420> awakened<00:04:58.990> I
