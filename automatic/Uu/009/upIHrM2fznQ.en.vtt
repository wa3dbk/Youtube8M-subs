now I'm looking for the graphics options
here<00:00:09.570> they're<00:00:09.840> pretty<00:00:09.960> simple<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:10.670> there's<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
here they're pretty simple but there's a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.660 
here they're pretty simple but there's a
lot<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.969> depth<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.330> them<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:14.250> roll<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
lot of depth to them so let's roll the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:31.730 
lot of depth to them so let's roll the
intro<00:00:29.029> alright<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.449> demo<00:00:30.630> file<00:00:31.230> size<00:00:31.560> is

intro alright so the demo file size is
only<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.189> 6070<00:00:32.969> Meg's<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.989> quite<00:00:34.230> easy

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
only about 6070 Meg's so it's quite easy

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.970 
only about 6070 Meg's so it's quite easy
to<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.550> grab<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.600> yourself<00:00:36.980> this

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to go grab and try for yourself this

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
to go grab and try for yourself this
game<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> sort<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> platformer

game is sort of like a platformer
adventure<00:00:40.290> action<00:00:40.469> sort<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> game<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.520> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
adventure action sort of game if you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270 
adventure action sort of game if you
watched<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.600> blade<00:00:43.050> kitten<00:00:43.440> video<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> my

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
watched my blade kitten video back on my

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
watched my blade kitten video back on my
previous<00:00:44.640> channel<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:46.399> got<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
previous channel you would have got a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
previous channel you would have got a
good<00:00:47.700> idea<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.300> sort<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> game<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> might

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
good idea of what sort of game you might

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
good idea of what sort of game you might
expect<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.700> game<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.149> originally<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
expect but this game was originally a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.139 
expect but this game was originally a
Wii<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.699> able<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> notice

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
Wii game so you will be able to notice

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
Wii game so you will be able to notice
that<00:00:54.300> later<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> mainly

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that later on but for now this is mainly

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.630 
that later on but for now this is mainly
a<00:00:56.840> tutorial<00:00:57.840> level<00:00:58.250> probably<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> best

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
a tutorial level probably not the best

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.959 
a tutorial level probably not the best
idea<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> show

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
idea I think because if you want to show

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
idea I think because if you want to show
off<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.170> show<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
off a game and what it can do show off a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
off a game and what it can do show off a
proper<00:01:04.920> level<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> demo<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
proper level not just a demo but you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
proper level not just a demo but you
know<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> can't<00:01:07.409> help<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:09.060> half

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
know you can't help that that first half

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
know you can't help that that first half
the<00:01:09.420> level<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> boring<00:01:10.500> until<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the level is kind of boring until you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
the level is kind of boring until you
actually<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> control<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> Zeus<00:01:13.290> is

parts<00:02:00.049> on<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.320> top<00:02:00.560> left<00:02:00.830> there<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.000> can

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
parts on the top left there so you can

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.420 
parts on the top left there so you can
take<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.960> couple<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.470> hits<00:02:03.650> before<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.979> die

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
take a couple of hits before you die

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.180 
take a couple of hits before you die
there<00:02:05.000> are<00:02:05.200> spawn<00:02:06.200> points<00:02:06.590> around<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.920> area

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
there are spawn points around the area

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.609 
there are spawn points around the area
so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.939> flames<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.440> die

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
so you like the flames up and if you die

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.809 
so you like the flames up and if you die
go<00:02:09.920> back<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.130> those<00:02:10.280> points<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:12.700> yeah<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
go back to those points so yeah the

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.010 
go back to those points so yeah the
first<00:02:13.850> like<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.300> said<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.540> first<00:02:14.690> half<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
first like I said the first half the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.790 
first like I said the first half the
level<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.410> isn't<00:02:15.650> too<00:02:15.830> much<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.580> but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
level there isn't too much going on but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.130 
level there isn't too much going on but
I<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:19.040> told<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.459> about<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.480> game<00:02:20.660> now<00:02:20.930> it's

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
I just told you about the game now it's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.780 
I just told you about the game now it's
um

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
um

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.479 
um
apparently<00:02:22.790> real<00:02:23.450> physics<00:02:24.020> based<00:02:24.340> sort<00:02:25.340> of

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
apparently real physics based sort of

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.150 
apparently real physics based sort of
gameplay<00:02:26.110> where<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.260> know<00:02:27.380> he<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.680> push<00:02:27.890> pots

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
gameplay where you know he can push pots

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.130 
gameplay where you know he can push pots
over<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.580> they<00:02:28.640> sort<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.910> fall<00:02:29.060> over

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
over and they sort of fall over

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.570 
over and they sort of fall over
realistically<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.340> apparently

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
realistically and you know apparently

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.850 
realistically and you know apparently
that's<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.000> I'm<00:02:32.120> reading<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.690> yeah<00:02:33.590> there's

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's what I'm reading but yeah there's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520 
that's what I'm reading but yeah there's
also<00:02:34.010> some<00:02:34.340> steam<00:02:34.610> achievement<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.410> a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
also some steam achievement so that's a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.300 
also some steam achievement so that's a
bonus<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:37.970> only<00:02:38.120> ten<00:02:38.480> dollars<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
bonus for you it is only ten dollars and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.550 
bonus for you it is only ten dollars and
overall<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> would<00:02:40.700> recommend<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:42.050> game<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
overall I would recommend this game it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.640 
overall I would recommend this game it
is<00:02:42.800> quite<00:02:43.040> good<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.600> said<00:02:45.019> before<00:02:45.230> though

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
is quite good like I said before though

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.800 
is quite good like I said before though
you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.610> best<00:02:47.030> gameplay<00:02:47.360> isn't

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
you know the best gameplay isn't

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
you know the best gameplay isn't
probably<00:02:48.319> displayed<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> demo<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:49.670> you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
probably displayed in the demo so you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.000 
probably displayed in the demo so you
would<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.540> buy<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:51.110> get<00:02:51.650> access<00:02:51.980> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
would have to buy it to get access to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610 
would have to buy it to get access to
everything<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.080> push<00:02:54.290> blocks

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
everything but you can push blocks

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.680 
everything but you can push blocks
around<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.280> once<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.090> get<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.390> second

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
around and once you get to the second

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.880 
around and once you get to the second
half<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> level<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.350> get<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> gods

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
half the level and you get the gods

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.340 
half the level and you get the gods
power<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.700> do<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.150> lot<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.540> fun<00:02:59.780> stuff<00:03:02.350> okay

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
power you can do a lot of fun stuff okay

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.310 
power you can do a lot of fun stuff okay
so<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:05.209> thing<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.480> noticed<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.019> character

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
so one thing I noticed is the character

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.870 
so one thing I noticed is the character
doesn't<00:03:06.620> move<00:03:06.769> very<00:03:07.010> fast<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.579> sort<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
doesn't move very fast and I sort of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.810 
doesn't move very fast and I sort of
underestimated<00:03:08.739> how<00:03:09.739> fast<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.250> can<00:03:10.310> move<00:03:10.609> as

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
underestimated how fast I can move as

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.970 
underestimated how fast I can move as
you<00:03:10.970> watch<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.810> part<00:03:12.049> right<00:03:12.260> here<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.739> move

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you watch this part right here you move

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.599 
you watch this part right here you move
and<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:13.700> BAM<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.540> died<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:15.109> didn't<00:03:15.980> die<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.430> I

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
and then BAM I died or didn't die but I

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.920 
and then BAM I died or didn't die but I
lost<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.540> bit<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.690> health<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:20.180> okay<00:03:20.600> I'm<00:03:20.660> still

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
lost a bit of health it's okay I'm still

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.710 
lost a bit of health it's okay I'm still
going<00:03:21.170> across

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
going across

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.450 
going across
now<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.710> sort<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.040> careful<00:03:24.220> a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
now you do have to sort of be careful a

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.190 
now you do have to sort of be careful a
little<00:03:24.670> bit<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.240> we<00:03:25.300> don't<00:03:25.480> get<00:03:25.600> too<00:03:25.720> careless

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
little bit and we don't get too careless

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.060 
little bit and we don't get too careless
like<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.500> did<00:03:28.350> now<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.410> thought<00:03:29.740> this<00:03:29.890> is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
like I just did now I thought this is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.770 
like I just did now I thought this is
fun<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.340> get<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.790> push<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.270> pot<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.570> what<00:03:31.690> you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
fun you get to push the pot and what you

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.620 
fun you get to push the pot and what you
get<00:03:31.930> smashed<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.500> bits<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.270> that's<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.450> good

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
get smashed to bits and that's a good

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.970 
get smashed to bits and that's a good
thing<00:03:34.810> too<00:03:34.960> because<00:03:34.990> also<00:03:35.460> there's<00:03:36.460> a<00:03:36.550> help<00:03:36.820> in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
thing too because also there's a help in

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.950 
thing too because also there's a help in
there<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:41.670> there<00:03:42.670> are<00:03:42.790> how<00:03:43.390> many<00:03:43.420> levels<00:03:43.720> are

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
there so there are how many levels are

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.190 
there so there are how many levels are
there

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
there

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.570 
there
I<00:03:44.350> think<00:03:45.130> that's<00:03:45.310> yeah<00:03:45.640> 12<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:47.290> first<00:03:48.190> level

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
I think that's yeah 12 the first level

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.370 
I think that's yeah 12 the first level
is<00:03:48.640> probably<00:03:48.790> mainly<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.360> tutorial<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.230> it's

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
is probably mainly a tutorial so it's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.290 
is probably mainly a tutorial so it's
not<00:03:50.500> going<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.680> be<00:03:50.740> excessively<00:03:51.310> long<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.820> mean

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
not going to be excessively long I mean

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.450 
not going to be excessively long I mean
I<00:03:52.420> did<00:03:52.600> find<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.230> was<00:03:53.320> quite<00:03:53.560> short<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:54.250> he'd

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
I did find it was quite short if he'd

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.240 
I did find it was quite short if he'd
finished<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.850> in<00:03:54.910> about<00:03:55.090> seven<00:03:55.480> eight<00:03:55.930> minutes

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
finished it in about seven eight minutes

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.010 
finished it in about seven eight minutes
but<00:03:57.250> I'm<00:03:57.670> assuming<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.240> rest<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> game<00:03:58.780> is

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
but I'm assuming the rest of the game is

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.330 
but I'm assuming the rest of the game is
gonna<00:03:59.560> be<00:03:59.740> relatively<00:04:00.130> long<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.980> graphics

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
gonna be relatively long the graphics

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.760 
gonna be relatively long the graphics
are<00:04:03.460> nice<00:04:03.690> they<00:04:04.690> look<00:04:04.720> pretty<00:04:05.110> smooth<00:04:05.500> and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
are nice they look pretty smooth and

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.730 
are nice they look pretty smooth and
sleek<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:08.050> probably<00:04:08.200> don't<00:04:08.440> need<00:04:08.620> the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
sleek and you probably don't need the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.010 
sleek and you probably don't need the
best<00:04:08.950> computer<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.490> run<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.840> always

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
best computer to run this you can always

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.180 
best computer to run this you can always
just<00:04:11.140> turn<00:04:11.290> down<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.500> settings<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.040> things

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
just turn down the settings and things

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.410 
just turn down the settings and things
like<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:14.670> but<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.790> puzzles<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.330> game

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
like that but the puzzles in this game

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.039 
like that but the puzzles in this game
aren't<00:04:16.840> quite<00:04:17.049> interesting<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.630> way<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> get

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
aren't quite interesting and way to get

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.599 
aren't quite interesting and way to get
the<00:04:20.170> gotcha<00:04:20.470> power<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.890> that's<00:04:21.010> when<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.459> fun

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the gotcha power and that's when the fun

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.430 
the gotcha power and that's when the fun
starts<00:04:21.970> happening<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:23.110> can<00:04:23.230> clearly

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
starts happening and you can clearly

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.680 
starts happening and you can clearly
tell<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:24.130> was<00:04:24.250> Ben<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.670> was<00:04:24.790> ported<00:04:25.420> over<00:04:25.510> from

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
tell it was Ben it was ported over from

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.310 
tell it was Ben it was ported over from
the<00:04:25.930> weak<00:04:26.050> because<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.660> cursor<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.900> get

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
the weak because of the cursor you get

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.310 
the weak because of the cursor you get
soon<00:04:29.770> enough<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.690> can<00:04:31.900> actually<00:04:32.020> kill

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
soon enough now you can actually kill

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.920 
soon enough now you can actually kill
the<00:04:32.440> birds<00:04:32.650> at<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.890> moment<00:04:33.310> which<00:04:33.460> is<00:04:33.930> you

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
the birds at the moment which is you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.780 
the birds at the moment which is you
know<00:04:35.050> I'm<00:04:35.410> not<00:04:35.590> quite<00:04:36.040> sure<00:04:36.070> what<00:04:36.430> sort<00:04:36.700> of

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
know I'm not quite sure what sort of

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.380 
know I'm not quite sure what sort of
powers<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.840> fairy<00:04:38.470> would<00:04:38.680> have<00:04:39.030> not<00:04:40.030> even<00:04:40.090> sure

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
powers a fairy would have not even sure

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.520 
powers a fairy would have not even sure
if<00:04:40.450> it's<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> Farias<00:04:41.200> or<00:04:42.070> call<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.490> fairy<00:04:43.530> so

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
if it's a Farias or call it a fairy so

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.350 
if it's a Farias or call it a fairy so
what<00:04:44.890> else<00:04:45.040> we<00:04:45.190> got<00:04:45.340> going<00:04:45.400> on

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
what else we got going on

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.020 
what else we got going on
they're<00:04:48.360> also<00:04:48.780> time<00:04:49.560> trials<00:04:50.100> which<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:50.910> can

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
they're also time trials which you can

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.830 
they're also time trials which you can
do<00:04:51.980> now<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.340> bit<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.790> funny<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.330> reminds<00:04:54.810> me

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
do now this bit is funny it reminds me

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.020 
do now this bit is funny it reminds me
of<00:04:54.960> banjo<00:04:55.500> kazooie<00:04:55.670> now<00:04:56.670> if<00:04:56.760> you've<00:04:56.880> played

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
of banjo kazooie now if you've played

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.940 
of banjo kazooie now if you've played
those<00:04:57.300> games<00:04:57.330> every<00:04:58.110> time<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.290> character<00:04:58.530> talk

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
those games every time a character talk

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.940 
those games every time a character talk
they<00:04:59.390> mumble<00:05:00.390> some<00:05:00.660> weird<00:05:00.960> language<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.830> then

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
they mumble some weird language and then

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.890 
they mumble some weird language and then
you<00:05:01.980> see<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.310> text<00:05:02.580> on<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.760> screen<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.630> then

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
you see the text on the screen and then

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.800 
you see the text on the screen and then
definitely<00:05:04.200> reminded<00:05:04.890> me<00:05:04.980> of<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.540> I'm

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
definitely reminded me of that so I'm

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.830 
definitely reminded me of that so I'm
you<00:05:07.350> know<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> bit<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.680> nostalgia<00:05:08.070> there<00:05:08.840> but

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
you know a bit of nostalgia there but

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.270 
you know a bit of nostalgia there but
here<00:05:10.110> we<00:05:10.200> go<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.530> now<00:05:10.560> we've<00:05:10.800> gotten<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.100> gods

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
here we go so now we've gotten the gods

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.340 
here we go so now we've gotten the gods
power<00:05:11.520> we<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.330> use<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.660> mouse<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.020> actually

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
power we can use the mouse to actually

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.590 
power we can use the mouse to actually
control<00:05:13.740> items<00:05:14.010> push<00:05:14.520> them<00:05:14.730> around<00:05:14.850> lift<00:05:15.390> them

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
control items push them around lift them

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.380 
control items push them around lift them
up<00:05:16.100> at<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.370> moment<00:05:17.730> I'm<00:05:17.820> not<00:05:17.850> sure<00:05:18.090> what<00:05:18.210> else

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
up at the moment I'm not sure what else

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.780 
up at the moment I'm not sure what else
you<00:05:18.480> can<00:05:18.600> do<00:05:18.720> but<00:05:19.110> I'm<00:05:19.650> assuming<00:05:19.980> you<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.340> you

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
you can do but I'm assuming you can you

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.880 
you can do but I'm assuming you can you
know<00:05:20.910> kill<00:05:21.270> enemies<00:05:21.630> with<00:05:21.660> your<00:05:22.350> powers<00:05:22.800> and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
know kill enemies with your powers and

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.910 
know kill enemies with your powers and
stuff<00:05:23.130> like<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.510> but<00:05:24.510> as<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:24.870> see<00:05:24.930> now<00:05:25.620> a

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
stuff like that but as you can see now a

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.500 
stuff like that but as you can see now a
lot<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> interactivity<00:05:26.880> begins

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
lot of the interactivity begins

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.440 
lot of the interactivity begins
I'm<00:05:27.690> just<00:05:28.620> moving<00:05:29.130> these<00:05:29.490> columns<00:05:30.000> down<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.420> I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
I'm just moving these columns down so I

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.720 
I'm just moving these columns down so I
can<00:05:30.600> actually<00:05:30.720> reach<00:05:31.080> them<00:05:31.320> because<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:32.580> you

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
can actually reach them because if you

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.860 
can actually reach them because if you
don't<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.090> won't<00:05:33.180> be<00:05:33.330> able<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.510> get<00:05:33.630> up<00:05:33.720> there

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
don't you won't be able to get up there

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.780 
don't you won't be able to get up there
obviously<00:05:35.750> now<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:36.780> lot<00:05:37.020> of<00:05:37.110> puzzles<00:05:37.580> are<00:05:38.580> quite

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
obviously now a lot of puzzles are quite

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.970 
obviously now a lot of puzzles are quite
interactive<00:05:39.300> as<00:05:39.420> well<00:05:39.570> most<00:05:39.870> of<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.590> things

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
interactive as well most of the things

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.830 
interactive as well most of the things
you<00:05:41.130> can<00:05:41.250> move<00:05:41.490> have<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.940> Sun<00:05:42.210> iPhone<00:05:42.600> on<00:05:42.720> them

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
you can move have the Sun iPhone on them

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.100 
you can move have the Sun iPhone on them
so<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.080> can<00:05:43.410> sort<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.680> tell<00:05:43.970> what<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.750> need<00:05:45.930> to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
so you can sort of tell what you need to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.230 
so you can sort of tell what you need to
do<00:05:46.230> you<00:05:46.470> won't<00:05:46.590> ever<00:05:46.800> get<00:05:47.040> confused<00:05:47.220> as<00:05:47.910> far<00:05:48.150> as

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
do you won't ever get confused as far as

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.410

little bit odd but and yeah that's the

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.400 
little bit odd but and yeah that's the
