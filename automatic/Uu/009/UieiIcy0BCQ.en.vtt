so<00:00:00.149> as<00:00:00.299> you<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.599> know<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:01.020> final<00:00:01.319> unit<00:00:01.469> video

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so as you guys know the final unit video

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.980 
so as you guys know the final unit video
would<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.730> naval<00:00:03.149> units<00:00:03.480> now<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.720> first

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
would be the naval units now the first

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.480 
would be the naval units now the first
name<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.230> unit<00:00:04.650> we're<00:00:04.799> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.069> be<00:00:05.220> looking

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
name of unit we're going to be looking

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.639 
name of unit we're going to be looking
at<00:00:05.580> would<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.359> fabrication<00:00:06.899> ship<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.440> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
at would be the fabrication ship that is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.280 
at would be the fabrication ship that is
built<00:00:07.980> from<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.820> naval<00:00:09.120> factory<00:00:09.450> now<00:00:09.900> here's

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
built from the naval factory now here's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.360 
built from the naval factory now here's
something<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.650> keep<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.889> mind<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
something to keep in mind the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
something to keep in mind the
fabrication<00:00:11.880> ships<00:00:12.179> are<00:00:12.630> actually<00:00:13.170> way<00:00:13.469> way

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
fabrication ships are actually way way

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
fabrication ships are actually way way
way<00:00:13.920> different<00:00:14.190> than<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> fabrication<00:00:15.299> ships

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
way different than the fabrication ships

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.750 
way different than the fabrication ships
that<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:15.929> seen<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.230> air<00:00:16.619> vehicles<00:00:17.190> land

and<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.670> thing<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:20.850> them<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.539> they

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and the thing about them is that they

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.390 
and the thing about them is that they
can<00:00:21.840> build<00:00:22.020> an<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> complete<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:22.949> array<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
can build an a complete new array of

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
can build an a complete new array of
buildings<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.240> can<00:00:24.420> build<00:00:24.570> jellyfish<00:00:25.080> which

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
buildings they can build jellyfish which

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
buildings they can build jellyfish which
are<00:00:25.710> sea<00:00:25.920> mines<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.730> used<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
are sea mines which can be used to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
are sea mines which can be used to
destroy<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.320> hulls<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.680> ships<00:00:29.210> they<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
destroy the hulls of ships they have a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
energy plants and see metal extractor
which<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> entirely<00:00:36.690> possible<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
which makes it entirely possible to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
which makes it entirely possible to
focus<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.190> entire<00:00:38.460> empire<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> sea

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
focus your entire empire on the sea

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
focus your entire empire on the sea
which<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.780> pretty<00:00:39.930> good<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
which is pretty good and would make a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
which is pretty good and would make a
very<00:00:41.520> interesting<00:00:42.300> scenario<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:43.350> you're

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
very interesting scenario when you're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
very interesting scenario when you're
fighting<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.730> planet<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.450> surrounded

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
fighting in a planet that's surrounded

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
fighting in a planet that's surrounded
by<00:00:46.110> water<00:00:46.350> well<00:00:46.860> full<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.280> water<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:49.140> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
by water well full of water and you have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.279 
by water well full of water and you have
a<00:00:49.620> sea<00:00:49.710> bass<00:00:50.160> sea<00:00:51.149> bass<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> bass<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a sea bass sea bass the bass and you

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
a sea bass sea bass the bass and you
have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> sea<00:00:52.710> based<00:00:53.309> army<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> they're<00:00:54.180> duking

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have a sea based army and they're duking

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
have a sea based army and they're duking
it<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.590> cool<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.430> much

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it out so it's pretty cool but it's much

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
it out so it's pretty cool but it's much
like<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> look<00:00:57.239> three<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
like when I look three in which you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
like when I look three in which you
could<00:00:59.090> basically<00:01:00.090> run<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.899> entire<00:01:01.020> empire

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
could basically run your entire empire

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
could basically run your entire empire
on<00:01:02.160> sea<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:04.309> obviously<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.460> course<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.939> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
on sea and obviously of course they can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
on sea and obviously of course they can
build<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> events<00:01:06.600> naval<00:01:06.840> Factory<00:01:07.200> thank<00:01:07.710> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
build the events naval Factory thank you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.679 
build the events naval Factory thank you
build<00:01:08.040> sonar<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:09.000> detect<00:01:09.240> naval

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
build sonar which can detect naval

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
build sonar which can detect naval
threats<00:01:09.990> which<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:11.040> pretty<00:01:11.250> good<00:01:11.460> against

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
threats which are pretty good against

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.910 
threats which are pretty good against
detecting<00:01:12.360> submarines<00:01:12.930> torpedo<00:01:13.590> launcher

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
detecting submarines torpedo launcher

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.260 
detecting submarines torpedo launcher
which<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.340> against<00:01:14.580> submarines<00:01:14.939> well

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
which are good against submarines well

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.630 
which are good against submarines well
and<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:16.080> barriers<00:01:16.380> which<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.890> walls<00:01:17.310> on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and see barriers which are like walls on

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
and see barriers which are like walls on
land<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> Scout<00:01:18.750> vehicle<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> naval

land the Scout vehicle for the naval

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
land the Scout vehicle for the naval
units<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.150> sunfish<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
units would be the sunfish and on the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
units would be the sunfish and on the
sunfish<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.619> fast<00:01:22.830> lightly<00:01:23.700> armored

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
sunfish is pretty fast lightly armored

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
sunfish is pretty fast lightly armored
and<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> nuisance<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> little

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and is a nuisance and could do a little

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.710 
and is a nuisance and could do a little
bit<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> harassment<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.360> much<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bit of harassment but much like the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
bit of harassment but much like the
Firefly<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.250> skitter<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.790> doesn't<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
Firefly and the skitter it doesn't do a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
Firefly and the skitter it doesn't do a
lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> damage<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> next<00:01:32.610> vehicle<00:01:32.759> we're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
lot of damage the next vehicle we're

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
lot of damage the next vehicle we're
going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.600> looking<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> naval

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
going to be looking at from the naval

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to be looking at from the naval
units<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> narwhal<00:01:35.579> nonon<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.090> wall

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
units would be the narwhal nonon or wall

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
units would be the narwhal nonon or wall
can<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> surprising<00:01:37.740> amount<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> damage<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
can do a surprising amount of damage to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.679 
can do a surprising amount of damage to
ships<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.850> well<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> good<00:01:39.390> amount<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> damage

it's pretty soon this guy is pretty good
the<00:02:08.280> narwhals<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.149> against

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.100 
ship even though the narwhals RK against
ships<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.239> generally<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.720> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> build

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
ships so generally you want to build

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.809 
ships so generally you want to build
narwhals<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.860> protect<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> blue<00:02:17.459> bottles

from aircraft the final tier one ship
we're<00:02:20.879> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.209> looking<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.629> be

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
we're going to be looking at would be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
we're going to be looking at would be
the<00:02:21.840> dolphin<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.440> dolphin<00:02:22.920> does<00:02:23.069> an

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the dolphin now the dolphin does an

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.949 
the dolphin now the dolphin does an
incredible<00:02:23.819> amount<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.030> damage<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.480> ships<00:02:24.750> as

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
incredible amount of damage to ships as

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.650 
incredible amount of damage to ships as
well<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.800> naval<00:02:26.310> factories<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.480> same

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
well as naval factories but at the same

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.559 
well as naval factories but at the same
time<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.140> dolphin<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:29.640> be<00:02:29.849> seen<00:02:30.150> by<00:02:30.330> blue

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
time the dolphin can be seen by blue

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.530 
time the dolphin can be seen by blue
bottles<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.080> because<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.920> could<00:02:32.540> put

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
bottles and because this this could put

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.780 
bottles and because this this could put
the<00:02:33.630> dolphin<00:02:33.989> at<00:02:34.110> harm's<00:02:34.349> way<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.890> could

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the dolphin at harm's way and could

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.789 
the dolphin at harm's way and could
generally<00:02:36.300> completely<00:02:37.080> destroy<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> dolphin

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
generally completely destroy the dolphin

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.800 
generally completely destroy the dolphin
now<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.459> dolphin<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.000> hard<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.360> see<00:02:39.510> because

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
now the dolphin is hard to see because

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.990 
now the dolphin is hard to see because
it<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.080> submarine<00:02:40.560> which<00:02:40.709> requires<00:02:41.549> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
it is a submarine which requires the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.059 
it is a submarine which requires the
your<00:02:42.480> opponents<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.019> actually<00:02:43.440> build<00:02:43.620> sonar

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
your opponents to actually build sonar

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.670 
your opponents to actually build sonar
or<00:02:44.480> instead<00:02:45.480> detect<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.349> submarine

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
or instead detect the submarine

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.600 
or instead detect the submarine
beforehand<00:02:47.160> before<00:02:47.599> allowing<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:50.430> blue

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
beforehand before allowing the the blue

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.509 
beforehand before allowing the the blue
bottles<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> basically<00:02:51.750> destroy<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.230> sub<00:02:52.519> now

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
bottles to basically destroy the sub now

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
bottles to basically destroy the sub now
the<00:02:53.579> sub<00:02:53.819> does<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> higher<00:02:54.480> amount<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the sub does do a higher amount of a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.930 
the sub does do a higher amount of a
very<00:02:55.620> good<00:02:55.799> amount<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.069> damage<00:02:56.190> against<00:02:56.670> ships

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
very good amount of damage against ships

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.330 
very good amount of damage against ships
so<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.599> means<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.349> battleship<00:02:58.980> doesn't

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
so that means if a battleship doesn't

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.289 
so that means if a battleship doesn't
destroy<00:02:59.549> this<00:02:59.760> guy<00:02:59.880> first

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
destroy this guy first

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
destroy this guy first
this<00:03:00.870> guy<00:03:01.049> will<00:03:01.230> pretty<00:03:01.650> much<00:03:01.739> destroy<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
this guy will pretty much destroy the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.039 
this guy will pretty much destroy the
battleship<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.420> next<00:03:03.599> unit<00:03:03.840> we're

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
battleship now in the next unit we're

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.030 
battleship now in the next unit we're
going<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.380> looking<00:03:04.650> at<00:03:04.709> would<00:03:04.829> be<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
going to be looking at would be the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
going to be looking at would be the
fabricator<00:03:05.579> sub<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.000> fabricator<00:03:06.569> sub

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
fabricator sub now the fabricator sub

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.569 
fabricator sub now the fabricator sub
can<00:03:06.989> build<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> same<00:03:07.530> amount<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.220> buildings

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
can build the same amount of buildings

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.839 
can build the same amount of buildings
that<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.239> advancing<00:03:09.720> fabricating<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.590> build

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
that the advancing fabricating can build

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.789 
that the advancing fabricating can build
except<00:03:11.849> it's<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.540> sub<00:03:12.810> which<00:03:13.260> means<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.650> hard

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
except it's a sub which means it's hard

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.830 
except it's a sub which means it's hard
to<00:03:13.890> spot<00:03:14.130> him<00:03:14.250> because<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.030> could<00:03:15.599> be

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
to spot him because that it could be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.150 
to spot him because that it could be
very<00:03:16.049> wor<00:03:16.290> fall<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.650> build<00:03:16.829> these<00:03:16.920> guys

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
very wor fall to build these guys

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.890 
very wor fall to build these guys
instead<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.579> advanced<00:03:18.060> sea<00:03:18.269> fabricators

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
instead of advanced sea fabricators

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.170 
instead of advanced sea fabricators
because<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> fact<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.940> your

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
because of the fact that if your

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.849 
because of the fact that if your
opponent<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.540> attacking<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:22.019> lot<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.650> these

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
opponent is attacking a lot then these

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.340 
opponent is attacking a lot then these
guys<00:03:23.069> can<00:03:23.370> quickly<00:03:24.030> hide<00:03:24.269> away<00:03:24.420> build<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
guys can quickly hide away build a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.559 
guys can quickly hide away build a
building<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.859> hide<00:03:26.100> again<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.000> yeah<00:03:27.299> they're

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
building and hide again so yeah they're

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.319 
building and hide again so yeah they're
very<00:03:27.900> good<00:03:28.139> against<00:03:28.590> staying<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.430> visiting

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329

these guys are behemoths right now but
he<00:03:42.180> moves<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.660> looks<00:03:42.900> like<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> carrier<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.620> it

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
he moves it looks like a carrier but it

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.800 
he moves it looks like a carrier but it
really<00:03:43.889> isn't<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.519> more<00:03:45.060> or<00:03:45.329> less<00:03:45.359> an

guy and the final ship we're going to be

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.180 
guy and the final ship we're going to be
looking<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.079> would<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.500> Barracuda<00:04:17.039> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
looking at would be the Barracuda and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.620 
looking at would be the Barracuda and
then<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> Barracuda<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:17.940> an<00:04:18.120> upgraded

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
then the Barracuda is an upgraded

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.199 
then the Barracuda is an upgraded
submarine<00:04:19.560> which<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.370> has<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.880> ability<00:04:21.180> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
submarine which it has the ability to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.600 
submarine which it has the ability to
fire<00:04:21.479> more<00:04:21.659> subs<00:04:21.989> more<00:04:22.409> durable<00:04:22.860> it's<00:04:23.340> almost

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
fire more subs more durable it's almost

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550 
fire more subs more durable it's almost
impossible<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.450> spot<00:04:24.630> but<00:04:24.990> it's<00:04:25.169> still

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
impossible to spot but it's still

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.430 
impossible to spot but it's still
spot<00:04:26.160> them<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.580> has<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.600> ability<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.080> fire

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
spot them and has the ability to fire

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.860 
spot them and has the ability to fire
nuclear<00:04:28.950> weapons<00:04:29.669> so<00:04:30.210> keep<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.630> mind

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870
