00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 how to cut at the foundation 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:58.850
 yes write us but do something good 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.850
 you can accompany stony ones 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:17.220
 In addition, the stray occur even where 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:19.110
 hear that's the cool stunts yes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.539
 actually these distant churches for the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.539
 Microwave oven cooked for a long time 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 This thing you do not need in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 do the refrigerator 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 that is simply all by itself can 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.300
 it's a trip 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.650
 or that means it will not work for either 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.650
 We are exactly right 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.210
 there is no such thing as we could have ourselves 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.210
 actually could make errors 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.480
 Of course we should not be in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:24.910
 refrigerator set but there is the in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.910
 fridge 1 1 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:03:03.469
 However, the wrong people 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.959
 thought da quarter of trust in entry 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.150
 kissel but make some cool water 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:30.799
 it's different with a small one 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:34.189
 syringe I think we already have one 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:43.579
 Luxury for a guinea pig home with 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:48.530
 Waterbed is the fridge at this time 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:51.859
 Hall in what we need now 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.129
 every one of you has at home and at home 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.120
 two batteries, the diesel is the dearest to 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.949
 in addition liquid that is one 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.819
 a little bit bigger the leaf almost 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:07.669
 of course , that's it 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.829
 for my cool batteries there you can too 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.829
 all wonderful that we take ever 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.959
 Of course, do not just do it that way 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.760
 Deficits would hurt us 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.180
 that developed the cooling batteries in one 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.180
 cake 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.210
 He'll try the Town Hall completely 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.710
 not good 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.070
 for that you do not even need and 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:11.270
 Although that could be wonderful between 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:20.460
 warned and reach a guinea pig 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:30.020
 Could not do it all the time 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:30.020
 want to lay and what does not say asta 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.030
 just might want a bottle next to it 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.640
 that will and will freeze 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.620
 important is the must have a plastic bag 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.620
 side glass will break 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.849
 So I found that a real consequence of 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.849
 Munich or
