00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.410 

so<00:00:56.200> what<00:00:56.380> function<00:00:56.770> are<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:56.980> using<00:00:57.520> terrain

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
so what function are you using terrain

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.760 
so what function are you using terrain
this<00:00:58.630> time<00:00:58.900> Satya

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
this time Satya

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.590 
this time Satya
yeah<00:01:00.040> we're<00:01:00.310> using<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.790> rock<00:01:01.210> cool<00:01:01.420> as<00:01:01.570> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
yeah we're using a rock cool as a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.910 
yeah we're using a rock cool as a
feature<00:01:01.840> yep

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
feature yep

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.760 
feature yep
mother<00:01:04.580> there's<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.239> door<00:01:05.479> seals<00:01:05.810> yeah

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
mother there's a door seals yeah

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.330 
mother there's a door seals yeah
convenient<00:01:07.310> my<00:01:07.400> free<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.729> still<00:01:07.970> do<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.150> good

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.130 

so<00:01:13.939> we're<00:01:14.090> still<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.360> track<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.840> next

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
so we're still on track the next

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.109 
so we're still on track the next
obstacle<00:01:15.290> though<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.920> lab<00:01:16.220> speciality<00:01:16.939> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
obstacle though is a lab speciality a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.389 
obstacle though is a lab speciality a
concrete<00:01:17.720> hump<00:01:18.079> very<00:01:18.649> common<00:01:19.009> around<00:01:19.220> while

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
concrete hump very common around while

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.819 
concrete hump very common around while
you're<00:01:19.579> apparently<00:01:23.200> okay<00:01:24.200> Nick<00:01:24.380> now<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.590> lab

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
you're apparently okay Nick now the lab

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.620 
you're apparently okay Nick now the lab
got<00:01:25.039> over<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.369> pretty<00:01:25.579> easily<00:01:25.789> yeah<00:01:26.479> we

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
got over this pretty easily yeah we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
got over this pretty easily yeah we
think<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.960> discovery<00:01:27.380> will<00:01:27.619> do<00:01:27.770> well<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.340> did

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
think the discovery will do well it did

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.710 
think the discovery will do well it did
Roger<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.000> don't<00:01:29.240> think<00:01:29.330> we're<00:01:29.539> going<00:01:29.630> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
Roger but I don't think we're going to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.929 
Roger but I don't think we're going to
go<00:01:29.810> quite<00:01:30.140> at<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.439> same<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.039> same<00:01:31.340> speed<00:01:31.759> as

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
go quite at the same the same speed as

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.410 
go quite at the same the same speed as
they<00:01:32.149> did<00:01:33.640> ground<00:01:34.640> clearance<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.270> issue

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
they did ground clearance is the issue

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.499 
they did ground clearance is the issue
here<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.429> we're<00:01:37.429> over<00:01:37.610> using<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.360> height

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
here and we're over using the height

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.929 
here and we're over using the height
adjustment<00:01:38.659> fact<00:01:39.439> profile<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.310> box<00:01:40.490> it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
adjustment fact profile on the box it

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.460 
adjustment fact profile on the box it
got<00:01:41.119> us<00:01:41.210> over<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.600> ramp<00:01:41.750> over<00:01:42.079> nice<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
got us over that ramp over nice and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.789 
got us over that ramp over nice and
tight<00:01:42.619> yeah<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.899> next<00:01:45.229> challenge<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
tight yeah the next challenge is the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.710 
tight yeah the next challenge is the
