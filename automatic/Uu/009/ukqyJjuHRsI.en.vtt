well hello everybody and welcome to how

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.289 
well hello everybody and welcome to how
to<00:00:03.330> play<00:00:03.629> slide<00:00:04.049> part<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.910> the<00:00:05.910> first<00:00:06.120> couple

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
to play slide part to the first couple

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.480 
to play slide part to the first couple
parts<00:00:06.779> were<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.140> cover<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:08.160> basic

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
parts were going to cover the basic

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.370 
parts were going to cover the basic
principles<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.059> slide<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> first<00:00:10.019> part<00:00:10.290> we

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
principles of slide in the first part we

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.709 
principles of slide in the first part we
cover<00:00:10.590> tunings<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.880> touched<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.330> strings

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
cover tunings and we touched on strings

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
cover tunings and we touched on strings
and<00:00:12.960> slide<00:00:13.200> type<00:00:13.530> I'm<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> go<00:00:14.639> into

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and slide type I'm going to go into

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.300 
and slide type I'm going to go into
string<00:00:15.299> gauge<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.170> slides<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> bit<00:00:17.190> more

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
string gauge and slides up in a bit more

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.840 
string gauge and slides up in a bit more
detail<00:00:17.369> now<00:00:18.080> because<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.199> very<00:00:19.380> important

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
detail now because it's very important

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.490 
detail now because it's very important
now<00:00:20.850> there's<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> holy<00:00:21.270> trinity<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> comes

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
now there's a holy trinity when it comes

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.210 
now there's a holy trinity when it comes
to<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.760> setup<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.300> guitar<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.890> regard

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to the setup of your guitar with regard

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
to the setup of your guitar with regard
to<00:00:26.279> slide<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> action<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
to slide and that is the action the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
to slide and that is the action the
weight<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> strings<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
weight of the strings and also the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.680 
weight of the strings and also the
weight<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> slide<00:00:32.239> now<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.300> reason<00:00:33.480> for

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
weight of the slide now the reason for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
weight of the slide now the reason for
this<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> gauge<00:00:34.860> strings<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
this is that have you gauge strings you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is that have you gauge strings you
have<00:00:35.520> generally<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:37.219> but<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> heavy

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
have generally the better but the heavy

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
have generally the better but the heavy
gauge<00:00:38.700> strings<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.329> force<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.960> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
gauge strings the more force you can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260 
gauge strings the more force you can
apply<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> strings<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.030> weight

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
apply to the strings and the more weight

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.470 
apply to the strings and the more weight
is<00:00:43.190> needed<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.910> that's<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> reason

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is needed to do so and that's the reason

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
is needed to do so and that's the reason
why<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> heavier<00:00:46.440> gauge<00:00:46.620> slide

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
why you can use a heavier gauge slide

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
why you can use a heavier gauge slide
and<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> stands<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.789> reason<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and now it stands to reason but it's the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.439 
and now it stands to reason but it's the
reason<00:00:49.200> why<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.610> deciding<00:00:50.969> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
reason why if you are deciding just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
reason why if you are deciding just
initially<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> lighter<00:00:52.680> gauge

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
initially to keep the lighter gauge

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.529 
initially to keep the lighter gauge
strings<00:00:53.160> around<00:00:53.430> electric<00:00:53.940> guitar<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> just

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
strings around electric guitar and just

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
strings around electric guitar and just
learn<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> play<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> fundamentals<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> slides

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
learn to play the fundamentals of slides

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.180 
learn to play the fundamentals of slides
you<00:00:56.250> should<00:00:56.399> stay<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> lines<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.090> gauge

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you should stay with the lines of gauge

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.810 
you should stay with the lines of gauge
now<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> action<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.449> next<00:01:01.289> path<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.430> action

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
now the action is next path the action

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
now the action is next path the action
is<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.480> height<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.769> string<00:01:05.040> sit

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is the height at which the string sit

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.380 
is the height at which the string sit
above<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> fingerboard<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> whole<00:01:09.180> most

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
above the fingerboard now the whole most

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.300

guitars<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.930> set<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> low<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
guitars are set up to have a low to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
guitars are set up to have a low to
medium<00:01:11.520> action<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> makes<00:01:12.510> playing<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.470> lot

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
medium action this makes playing a lot

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.870 
medium action this makes playing a lot
easier<00:01:15.110> however<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.200> slide<00:01:16.759> there<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
easier however for slide there is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.039 
easier however for slide there is
usually<00:01:19.159> an<00:01:20.159> issue<00:01:20.340> particularly<00:01:21.210> higher<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
usually an issue particularly higher up

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
usually an issue particularly higher up
the<00:01:22.170> neck<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:23.009> lower<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> neck

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the neck or lower down the neck

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
the neck or lower down the neck
depending<00:01:24.119> upon<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.360> point<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> view<00:01:25.280> where

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
depending upon your point of view where

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
depending upon your point of view where
the<00:01:26.700> strings<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.360> close<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> fret

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the strings are so close to the fret

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.219 
the strings are so close to the fret
that<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.850> soon<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.479> any<00:01:30.600> force<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that as soon as you put any force on it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
that as soon as you put any force on it
that<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.530> isn't<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.829> finger<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.340> slide<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that it isn't your finger I slide it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.580 
that it isn't your finger I slide it
will<00:01:34.020> interfere<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> you'll<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.320> kind

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
will interfere so you'll get that kind

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.810 
will interfere so you'll get that kind
of<00:01:37.680> sound<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.340> popular<00:01:38.549> with

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
of sound which is very popular with

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
of sound which is very popular with
people<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> starting<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> way<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
people just starting out now the way to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
people just starting out now the way to
get<00:01:41.130> around<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.610> by<00:01:41.729> raising<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> action

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
get around this is by raising the action

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.950 
get around this is by raising the action
now<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.119> simply<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.420> electric

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
now you do this simply on electric

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
now you do this simply on electric
guitar<00:01:46.259> by<00:01:47.159> raising<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> saddles<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
guitar by raising the saddles of the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870 
guitar by raising the saddles of the
bridge<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.950> acoustic<00:01:50.189> guitar<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.370 
you're just starting out in slide
there's<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.239> lot<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.510> snobbery<00:03:56.900> about<00:03:57.230> which

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
there's a lot of snobbery about which

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.920 
there's a lot of snobbery about which
finger<00:03:57.680> oh<00:03:57.829> well<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.310> see<00:03:58.519> he<00:03:59.359> plays<00:03:59.570> like<00:03:59.720> my

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
finger oh well you see he plays like my

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.720 
finger oh well you see he plays like my
cootie<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.530> tell<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.950> it's<00:04:01.370> nothing<00:04:01.640> to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
cootie you can tell and it's nothing to

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.340 
cootie you can tell and it's nothing to
do<00:04:01.850> with<00:04:01.970> out<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.209> all<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.570> all<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.170> do<00:04:03.320> with

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
do with out at all it's all to do with

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.520 
do with out at all it's all to do with
comfort<00:04:05.320> so<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:07.400> final<00:04:07.730> part<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
comfort so the final part of this is the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.710 
comfort so the final part of this is the
way<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.890> slide<00:04:10.220> works<00:04:10.850> on<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.480> strings<00:04:13.720> when

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
way the slide works on the strings when

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.330 
way the slide works on the strings when
you're<00:04:14.840> playing<00:04:15.019> slide<00:04:15.290> essentially<00:04:15.950> your

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
you're playing slide essentially your

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.520 
you're playing slide essentially your
guitars<00:04:16.669> out<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:17.030> control<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.169> have<00:04:18.349> to

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
guitars out of control so you have to

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.410 
guitars out of control so you have to
reel<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.010> control<00:04:19.340> as<00:04:19.519> best<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.820> can

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
reel in the control as best you can

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.970 
reel in the control as best you can
the<00:04:20.780> first<00:04:20.990> mistake<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.680> lot<00:04:21.710> of<00:04:21.860> people

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
the first mistake that a lot of people

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.550 
the first mistake that a lot of people
make<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.670> letting<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.330> slide<00:04:23.720> just<00:04:24.230> run<00:04:24.470> up

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
make is letting the slide just run up

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.520 
make is letting the slide just run up
and<00:04:24.680> down<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.890> strings<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.170> problem<00:04:30.410> of

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
and down the strings now the problem of

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.100 
and down the strings now the problem of
doing<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.190> your<00:04:31.610> hearing<00:04:31.940> two<00:04:32.180> notes<00:04:32.450> for

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
doing that is your hearing two notes for

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.560 
doing that is your hearing two notes for
each<00:04:33.290> strength<00:04:34.250> your<00:04:34.970> hearing<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.390> note

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
each strength your hearing the note

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.240 
each strength your hearing the note
that's<00:04:35.780> imported<00:04:36.350> from<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.710> side<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that's imported from this side of the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.130 
that's imported from this side of the
slide<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.420> note<00:04:38.600> that's<00:04:38.840> being<00:04:39.020> emitted

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
slide and the note that's being emitted

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.330 
slide and the note that's being emitted
from<00:04:39.560> this<00:04:39.770> side<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.280> slide

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.040 

sound<00:04:44.340> particularly<00:04:44.640> good<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.930> way<00:04:46.020> to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
sound particularly good and the way to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.840 
sound particularly good and the way to
get<00:04:46.290> around<00:04:46.410> this<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.890> simply<00:04:47.160> by<00:04:47.340> resting

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
get around this is simply by resting

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.190 
get around this is simply by resting
your<00:04:47.940> fingers<00:04:48.390> over<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.110> strings<00:04:49.520> like<00:04:50.520> that

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
your fingers over the strings like that

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.720 
your fingers over the strings like that
now<00:04:52.200> dats<00:04:52.470> press<00:04:52.710> too<00:04:52.890> hard<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.370> rest

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
now dats press too hard you just rest

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.440 
now dats press too hard you just rest
the<00:04:53.940> fingers<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:55.140> strands<00:04:59.300> there's<00:05:00.300> also

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
the fingers on the strands there's also

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.360 
the fingers on the strands there's also
benefits<00:05:00.990> other<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.710> couple<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.250> other

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
benefits other to a couple of other

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.510 
benefits other to a couple of other
parts<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.150> planks<00:05:03.450> line<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.980> first<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.460> that

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
parts of planks line the first is that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.240 
parts of planks line the first is that
it<00:05:05.940> adds<00:05:06.090> balance<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.720> your<00:05:06.780> hand<00:05:07.130> when<00:05:08.130> you're

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
it adds balance to your hand when you're

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.040 
it adds balance to your hand when you're
playing<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> vibrato<00:05:11.810> having<00:05:12.810> your<00:05:12.930> fingers

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
playing the vibrato having your fingers

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.980 
playing the vibrato having your fingers
there<00:05:13.230> allows<00:05:13.710> balance<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.810> other<00:05:15.810> most

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
there allows balance and the other most

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.840 
there allows balance and the other most
important<00:05:16.410> part<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.370> prevents<00:05:17.700> any

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
important part is that it prevents any

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.250 
important part is that it prevents any
unwanted<00:05:18.240> streams<00:05:18.720> from<00:05:18.810> ringing<00:05:19.050> out

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
unwanted streams from ringing out

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.380 
unwanted streams from ringing out
accidentally<00:05:19.980> it<00:05:20.550> happens<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.030> best<00:05:21.120> of

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
accidentally it happens to the best of

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.480 
accidentally it happens to the best of
us<00:05:21.510> you're<00:05:22.260> trying<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.530> play<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.770> nice<00:05:23.010> melody

us you're trying to play a nice melody

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.130 
us you're trying to play a nice melody
at<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.640> top<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:27.210> if<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.630> don't<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:28.020> that

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
at the top and if you don't have that

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.020 
at the top and if you don't have that
he'll<00:05:28.410> sell

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.450 

it's<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.240> simple<00:05:32.349> so<00:05:33.349> get<00:05:33.620> used<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:33.889> resting

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
it's that simple so get used to resting

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.800 
it's that simple so get used to resting
your<00:05:34.550> fingers<00:05:34.879> gently<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.509> strings

enough<00:05:36.199> so<00:05:36.379> that<00:05:36.410> there's<00:05:36.680> pressure<00:05:36.919> to

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
enough so that there's pressure to

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.070 
enough so that there's pressure to
prevent<00:05:37.400> them<00:05:37.580> from<00:05:37.610> ringing<00:05:37.910> out<00:05:38.150> but<00:05:38.720> not<00:05:38.900> so

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
prevent them from ringing out but not so

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.360 
prevent them from ringing out but not so
much<00:05:39.199> pressure<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.650> are<00:05:39.860> actually<00:05:39.979> pushing
