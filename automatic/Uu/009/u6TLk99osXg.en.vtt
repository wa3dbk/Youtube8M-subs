00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
repeats like a refrain throughout the

00:00:48.269 --> 00:01:00.829 
repeats like a refrain throughout the
intro<00:00:48.659> and<00:00:49.050> I'll<00:00:49.230> play<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> slowly<00:00:59.839> some

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
intro and I'll play it slowly some

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.540 
intro and I'll play it slowly some
people<00:01:01.109> count<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.400> difficult

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
people count that that can be difficult

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.250 
people count that that can be difficult
to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> timing<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> triplets

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to get the timing right on the triplets

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.940 
to get the timing right on the triplets
but<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> four<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.969> end

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
but think about the four in the end

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.560 
but think about the four in the end
that's<00:01:10.950> where<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.729> eighth<00:01:12.030> notes<00:01:12.360> would

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's where the eighth notes would

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.530 
that's where the eighth notes would
normally<00:01:12.990> fall<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.799> E<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:14.549> E<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> A

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
normally fall so one E and a two E and A

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:25.149 
normally fall so one E and a two E and A
three<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.560> four<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.950 

and<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.580> Lee<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> Allah<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.330> fun<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and that for Lee and Allah is fun to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.930 
and that for Lee and Allah is fun to
isolate<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.190> group<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:29.760> by
