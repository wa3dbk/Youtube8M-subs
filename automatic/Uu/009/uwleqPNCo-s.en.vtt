not very many YouTube videos I despite

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.350 
not very many YouTube videos I despite
on<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> videos<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> guys<00:01:54.030> mad<00:01:54.270> he's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
on one of the videos the guys mad he's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
on one of the videos the guys mad he's
got<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> switch<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.380> LEDs<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
got a switch there for some LEDs that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.929 
got a switch there for some LEDs that
are<00:01:56.070> under<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:57.420> oh<00:01:57.689> well

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
are under the back will oh well

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.789 
are under the back will oh well
and<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.210> she's<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.479> standard<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and so she's not standard there is a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
and so she's not standard there is a
grommet<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.340> though<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
grommet there though that's kind of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:16.399 
grommet there though that's kind of
handy<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:04.740> ignition

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.559 

so<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.620> someone<00:02:17.950> outside<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:19.150> was<00:02:19.359> going

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
so that someone outside what was going

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.449 
so that someone outside what was going
on<00:02:19.689> there

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
on there

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.670 
on there
you<00:02:21.730> see<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.000> fuel<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.390> six<00:02:23.019> bars<00:02:23.349> when<00:02:23.530> it's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
you see the fuel that six bars when it's

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.099 
you see the fuel that six bars when it's
fully<00:02:24.719> filled<00:02:25.719> up

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
fully filled up

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.869 
fully filled up
so<00:02:28.950> standard<00:02:29.950> there's<00:02:30.129> most<00:02:30.280> bikes<00:02:30.519> hasn't

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
so standard there's most bikes hasn't

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.490 
so standard there's most bikes hasn't
got<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> cutoff<00:02:31.569> switch<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.200> think<00:02:32.409> it's

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
got a cutoff switch I think it's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.970 
got a cutoff switch I think it's
got<00:02:32.620> an<00:02:32.709> automatic<00:02:32.769> one<00:02:33.310> shift<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.329> up<00:02:34.450> here

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
got an automatic one shift right up here

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.679 
got an automatic one shift right up here
it's<00:02:35.980> actually<00:02:36.459> quite<00:02:36.879> tight<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.329> not<00:02:37.359> loose

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
it's actually quite tight it's not loose

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.819 
it's actually quite tight it's not loose
so<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.349> good

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
so that's good

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.569 
so that's good
nice<00:02:39.519> clutch<00:02:39.909> sort<00:02:40.659> of<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.430> obviously<00:02:42.430> it's

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
nice clutch sort of a obviously it's

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.520 
nice clutch sort of a obviously it's
