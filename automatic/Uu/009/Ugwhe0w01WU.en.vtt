first time I just tell you why the
industry's<00:00:12.980> been<00:00:13.160> doing<00:00:13.580> it<00:00:13.670> wrong<00:00:13.699> for<00:00:13.879> so

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
industry's been doing it wrong for so

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.570 
industry's been doing it wrong for so
long<00:00:14.480> we<00:00:14.750> we<00:00:15.139> lighten<00:00:15.619> the<00:00:15.740> skin<00:00:15.889> in<00:00:16.250> order<00:00:16.340> to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
long we we lighten the skin in order to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.160 
long we we lighten the skin in order to
treat<00:00:16.760> age<00:00:16.910> spots<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:17.420> by<00:00:17.690> lightning<00:00:18.109> the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
treat age spots and by lightning the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.500 
treat age spots and by lightning the
skin<00:00:18.380> we<00:00:18.529> suppress<00:00:18.980> our<00:00:19.220> natural<00:00:20.060> melanin

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
skin we suppress our natural melanin

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.060 
skin we suppress our natural melanin
production<00:00:20.750> which<00:00:21.289> is<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.529> color<00:00:21.769> of<00:00:21.859> our

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
production which is the color of our

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.060 
production which is the color of our
skin<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.550> when<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:23.480> suppress<00:00:23.869> melanin<00:00:24.289> you

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
skin and when you suppress melanin you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.279 
skin and when you suppress melanin you
damage<00:00:25.669> your<00:00:25.789> skin<00:00:25.849> because<00:00:26.330> melanin<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.109> one

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
damage your skin because melanin is one

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.349 
damage your skin because melanin is one
of<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.470> key<00:00:27.650> ways<00:00:27.859> we<00:00:28.189> prevent<00:00:28.579> agent<00:00:28.939> think

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
of the key ways we prevent agent think

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.220 
of the key ways we prevent agent think
about<00:00:29.570> your<00:00:29.720> friends<00:00:30.079> who<00:00:30.140> are

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
about your friends who are

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.499 
about your friends who are
african-american<00:00:31.099> or<00:00:31.220> Hispanic<00:00:31.730> they<00:00:32.270> barely

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
african-american or Hispanic they barely

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.210 
african-american or Hispanic they barely
have<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.720> wrinkle<00:00:33.079> in<00:00:33.170> their<00:00:33.350> 60<00:00:33.710> that's

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
have a wrinkle in their 60 that's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.130 
have a wrinkle in their 60 that's
because<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.670> melanin<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.720> idea<00:00:35.750> that

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
because of melanin so the idea that

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.660 
because of melanin so the idea that
we're<00:00:36.440> going<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.590> suppress<00:00:37.070> all<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.550> our

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
we're going to suppress all of our

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.270 
we're going to suppress all of our
spaces<00:00:38.300> natural<00:00:39.140> protection<00:00:39.530> in<00:00:39.860> order<00:00:40.130> to

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
spaces natural protection in order to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.070 
spaces natural protection in order to
treat<00:00:40.700> those<00:00:40.940> little<00:00:41.180> bits<00:00:41.330> of<00:00:41.420> uneven<00:00:41.840> skin

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
treat those little bits of uneven skin

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.550 
treat those little bits of uneven skin
tone<00:00:42.190> is<00:00:43.190> just<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.450> it's<00:00:44.810> at<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.080> backwards

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
tone is just and it's at the backwards

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.290 
tone is just and it's at the backwards
approach<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.310> you<00:00:46.460> get<00:00:46.580> more<00:00:46.850> damage

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
approach because you get more damage

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.460 
approach because you get more damage
more<00:00:47.990> age<00:00:48.200> spots<00:00:48.560> and<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.220> problem<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.470> we

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
more age spots and it's a problem so we

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.290 
more age spots and it's a problem so we
just<00:00:52.040> recently<00:00:52.220> launched<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.850> new<00:00:53.000> product

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
just recently launched a new product

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.450 
just recently launched a new product
that<00:00:53.540> heals<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.440> part<00:00:54.740> of<00:00:54.800> your<00:00:54.950> skin<00:00:55.190> that's

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
that heals a part of your skin that's

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.160 
that heals a part of your skin that's
called<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.760> dermal<00:00:56.150> epidermal<00:00:56.600> junction<00:00:56.990> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
called the dermal epidermal junction and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.800 
called the dermal epidermal junction and
that<00:00:57.860> part<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.220> your<00:00:58.370> skin<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.510> top

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
that part of your skin is the the top

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.780 
that part of your skin is the the top
layer<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.110> your<00:01:00.320> skin<00:01:00.380> that<00:01:01.160> doesn't<00:01:01.550> replace

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
layer of your skin that doesn't replace

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.820 
layer of your skin that doesn't replace
itself<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:02.480> it's<00:01:02.660> taking<00:01:03.050> all<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.440> hits<00:01:03.590> since

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
itself so it's taking all the hits since

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.130 
itself so it's taking all the hits since
you're<00:01:03.980> born<00:01:04.400> all<00:01:05.000> every<00:01:05.449> sun<00:01:05.720> damage<00:01:06.020> you've

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
you're born all every sun damage you've

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.029 
you're born all every sun damage you've
ever<00:01:06.909> experienced<00:01:07.909> will<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:09.259> recorded<00:01:09.950> on

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
ever experienced will be recorded on

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.489 
ever experienced will be recorded on
your<00:01:10.100> dermal<00:01:10.549> epidermal<00:01:10.969> junction<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.499> this

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
your dermal epidermal junction and this

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.039 
your dermal epidermal junction and this
repairs<00:01:13.219> those<00:01:13.520> wounds<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.179> so<00:01:14.329> it<00:01:14.420> stops<00:01:14.719> the

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
repairs those wounds and so it stops the

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.560 
repairs those wounds and so it stops the
signal<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.460> age<00:01:16.579> spot<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.359> what<00:01:17.479> I'm

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
signal to the age spot so what I'm

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.539 
signal to the age spot so what I'm
talking<00:01:17.929> about<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.469> have<00:01:18.499> is<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> permanent

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
talking about we have is a permanent

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.730 
talking about we have is a permanent
treatment<00:01:20.509> for<00:01:20.840> an<00:01:20.929> age<00:01:21.020> spot<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.499> we

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
treatment for an age spot because we

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.340 
treatment for an age spot because we
heal<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.340> original<00:01:22.880> signaling<00:01:23.450> agent<00:01:23.810> that

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
heal the original signaling agent that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.429 
heal the original signaling agent that
causes<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.950> problem<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.909> takes<00:01:26.600> anywhere

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
causes that problem so it takes anywhere

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.230 
causes that problem so it takes anywhere
from<00:01:27.499> three<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.159> six<00:01:28.369> months<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.909> have<00:01:29.060> those

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
from three to six months to have those

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.450 
from three to six months to have those
age<00:01:29.420> spots<00:01:29.689> completely<00:01:30.200> disappear<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.249> then

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
age spots completely disappear but then

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.190 
age spots completely disappear but then
again<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:32.479> go<00:01:32.630> out<00:01:32.780> with<00:01:32.990> some

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
again you can go out with some

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.109 
again you can go out with some
protection<00:01:33.679> into<00:01:33.859> the<00:01:33.979> Sun<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.429> not<00:01:34.909> have

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
protection into the Sun and not have

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.510 
protection into the Sun and not have
them<00:01:35.270> recur<00:01:35.689> where's<00:01:36.139> not<00:01:36.499> right<00:01:36.710> now<00:01:36.920> with

them recur where's not right now with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.980 
them recur where's not right now with
the<00:01:37.639> current<00:01:37.789> therapies<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.689> know<00:01:38.840> we

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the current therapies as you know we

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.029 
the current therapies as you know we
keep<00:01:39.139> treating<00:01:39.439> them<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.619> get<00:01:39.710> them<00:01:39.829> lighter

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
keep treating them to get them lighter

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.410 
keep treating them to get them lighter
and<00:01:40.310> we're<00:01:40.639> scared<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:40.939> go<00:01:41.060> out<00:01:41.119> in<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.240> sin

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and we're scared to go out in the sin

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.429 
and we're scared to go out in the sin
because<00:01:41.569> we<00:01:41.659> know<00:01:41.780> they'll<00:01:41.929> come<00:01:42.109> right<00:01:42.259> back

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
because we know they'll come right back

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.830 
because we know they'll come right back
right<00:01:42.859> and<00:01:43.100> that's<00:01:43.399> with<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.700> restore<00:01:44.539> which

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
right and that's with the restore which
