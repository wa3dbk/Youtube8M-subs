00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
even thinner than the military so I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.300 
even thinner than the military so I
would<00:05:05.850> advise<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:07.260> be<00:05:07.590> too<00:05:07.920> rough

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
with these tips because uh the tip

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.140 
with these tips because uh the tip
probably<00:05:12.420> can<00:05:12.870> break<00:05:13.350> on<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.940> but<00:05:14.940> for
