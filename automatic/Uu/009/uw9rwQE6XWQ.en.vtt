 childhood offer to all those who live in 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.780
 America, someone knows about their states where 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.240

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.210
 where at first where to settle where much 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.970
 where you can find our work illegal 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.870
 legally in different areas i.e. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.660
 subscribe yu tuba i think that 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.260
 from the tower a great contribution can carry 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 using so many people we are now 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.860

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.400
 principle gets in every state by 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.560
 differently but I heard something about 13 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.300
 dollars what basically if you are all 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.230
 day you sit on take money for a joke 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.410
