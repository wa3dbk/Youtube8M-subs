00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.170
 very good friends as you see very much 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.450
 go out to the street like the old days 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.170
 for those of you who are fans of the channel 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.340
 5 x 1 from its beginnings in good 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.050
 first those leaving me there is a 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.580
 little to reflect and I wanted to make a 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.919
 little bit the same I left here to take 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.630
 the sun of a park more than anything because 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.300
 I wanted to comment 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 something about the movie of jobs that yesterday 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.170
 officially premiered in theaters 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.899
 Spanish people 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.739
 and the truth that I liked a lot did not arrive 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.960
 to understand very well the criticism that has 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.730
 had because to see yes it's true that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.309
 it's not a movie 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 go completely into the life of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 steve jobs 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 maybe it touches some features 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.449
 characteristic of his life in a way 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 superficial and does not go too far into 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.390
 details but good is that that is in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.309
 reality 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 what they should do to make a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.920
 movie that lasts two hours you go 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.830
 satisfied home and good and point the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.840
 problem is that people seem to be 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.060
 I wanted a lot more I expected a lot more 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.200
 and good for those people I say to 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.210
 that's the biography of walter isaacson 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.840
 they have tried to make the movie 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.760
 bored on twitter I read the comment 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.440
 it was quite repeated 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.090
 really if they had wanted to put 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.500
 Complement the steve jobs we would be 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.810
 watching one of the longest movies 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 of film history or could we 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.190
 be watching a movie of five or 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.990
 six seven hours easily not two hours 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.790
 it even made me short that that's 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.200
 what 's the good thing about a movie 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.630
 when a two-hour movie gets you 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.670
 makes cuts because something good has 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.440
 which have not I go to the cinema 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.560
 entertain me I pay my entrance and I go with 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.080
 the intention to stop me and directly 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.900
 this weekend if you are in spain or 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.600
 in Mexico or in Latin countries and that's it 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.460
 in your cinemas I really advise you 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.320
 that you go to the movies I'm not going to do 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.150
 no spoiler here because my intention 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.679
 is that you go though good to make a 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.410
 steve jobs spoiler for good is not 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.230
 not the worst thing in the world but but 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.209
 I advise you to go see it and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.340
 then if you want to comment a little 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.080
 our impressions but I already say to me 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.810
 I liked it and in this little video of 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040
 just 34 minutes I'm going to do what 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.000
 The only thing I want to do is encourage 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.940
 that you go, I went and I even tell you 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.010
 something important I went with my partner and my 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.410
 couple is not a steve apple fanboy 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.010
 jobs or from my pollen idea if you have a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.379
 iphone an iphone 5 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.260
 has an iphone 5 but is not a fan of 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.260
 the brand and he likes the movie and it came out 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.319
 and my son has become very short 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.439
 I do not know in this movie even if it's not 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.540
 completely the life of steve jobs you 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.890
 you realize he was a genius so 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.900
 good guys this has been all I hope 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.299
 that you are going to see the movie soon 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.980
 we will compare a little impressions and 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.470
 nothing do not miss the channel I'm going to 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.489
 try to upload this afternoon or tomorrow something 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 about haiti a radio because you have 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.260
 I asked for many to go up as you can 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.430
 install haiti king in all of you 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.280
 devices without needing to have a 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.500
 American account I've tried it and it's 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.099
 a joy so we see nothing in 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.099
