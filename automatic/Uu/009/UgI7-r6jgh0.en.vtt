00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.490 
creation why don't you tell us about it
well<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.970> few<00:00:06.540> months<00:00:06.600> ago<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.140> club<00:00:07.350> we

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
well a few months ago it's a club we

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.780 
well a few months ago it's a club we
decided<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:07.919> were<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> do<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.730> were

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
decided we were going to do we were

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.129 
decided we were going to do we were
invited<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> comic-con<00:00:09.480> here<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:09.990> thought

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
invited to comic-con here and I thought

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.690 
invited to comic-con here and I thought
well<00:00:10.320> what<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.099> would<00:00:11.250> fit<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
well what can I do that would fit in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.549 
well what can I do that would fit in
because<00:00:11.849> normally<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.300> do<00:00:12.389> space<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.080> thought

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
because normally I do space I thought

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
because normally I do space I thought
you<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.950> bet<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> could<00:00:15.260> do<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
you know what I bet you I could do a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.279 
you know what I bet you I could do a
Helicarrier<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.750> did<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> prototype

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
Helicarrier here so I I did a prototype

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.140 
Helicarrier here so I I did a prototype
engine<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.400> turned<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.699> pretty<00:00:20.910> good<00:00:21.090> so

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
engine and it turned out pretty good so

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.890 
engine and it turned out pretty good so
then<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.529> ramped<00:00:22.529> production<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.869> ran<00:00:24.869> out

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
then I ramped production up and ran out

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
then I ramped production up and ran out
of<00:00:25.050> parts<00:00:25.350> several<00:00:25.650> times<00:00:25.830> had<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.220> some

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
of parts several times had to do some

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.000 
of parts several times had to do some
online<00:00:26.460> orders<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.390> worked<00:00:28.320> feverishly<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
online orders and worked feverishly I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.820 
online orders and worked feverishly I
figure<00:00:29.490> I've<00:00:29.609> probably<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.529> five<00:00:31.529> six

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
figure I've probably got five six

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.380 
figure I've probably got five six
thousand<00:00:32.219> parts<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.640> there<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
thousand parts in there probably about a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.520 
thousand parts in there probably about a
hundred<00:00:33.750> hours<00:00:33.840> worth<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> labor<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:36.530> finish

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
hundred hours worth of labor and finish

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
hundred hours worth of labor and finish
it<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> last<00:00:38.040> minute<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.460> spent<00:00:38.730> 14<00:00:39.120> hours

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it up the last minute I spent 14 hours

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
it up the last minute I spent 14 hours
on<00:00:39.570> Monday<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.100> several<00:00:41.100> hours<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> Tuesday

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
on Monday and several hours on Tuesday

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
on Monday and several hours on Tuesday
and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.180> set<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.540> Wednesday<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.730> I've

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and then we set it up Wednesday and I've

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.180 
and then we set it up Wednesday and I've
got<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> I've<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
got all the I've got all your all the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
got all the I've got all your all the
superheroes<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.000> went<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.660> had<00:00:48.840> Lou<00:00:49.050> Ferrigno

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
superheroes I went and had Lou Ferrigno

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.869 
superheroes I went and had Lou Ferrigno
signed<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.950> Hulk

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.880 

so<00:00:55.570> what<00:00:55.719> was<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.930> most<00:00:56.109> difficult<00:00:56.260> part<00:00:56.559> on

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
so what was the most difficult part on

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.920 
so what was the most difficult part on
this<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.940> most<00:00:58.059> difficult<00:00:58.269> part<00:00:58.809> was

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
this the most difficult part was

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.979 
this the most difficult part was
figuring<00:00:59.379> out<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:01.000> circular<00:01:01.449> structure<00:01:01.870> on

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
figuring out the circular structure on

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.210 
figuring out the circular structure on
the<00:01:02.699> hella<00:01:03.699> engines<00:01:04.119> here<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.979> my<00:01:05.979> first

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
the hella engines here I my first

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.580 
the hella engines here I my first
prototype<00:01:06.490> when<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.330> first<00:01:07.570> tried<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.320> put<00:01:08.500> it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
prototype when I first tried to put it

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.230 
prototype when I first tried to put it
on<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> ship<00:01:08.830> wouldn't<00:01:09.310> match<00:01:09.580> up<00:01:09.820> because<00:01:09.970> it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
on the ship wouldn't match up because it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.149 
on the ship wouldn't match up because it
wasn't<00:01:10.390> round<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:10.930> didn't<00:01:11.140> realize<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.560> so

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
wasn't round and I didn't realize it so

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.499 
wasn't round and I didn't realize it so
I<00:01:12.190> had<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.399> rebuild<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.060> like<00:01:13.180> three<00:01:13.390> or<00:01:13.420> four

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
I had to rebuild it like three or four

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.139 
I had to rebuild it like three or four
times<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.899> get<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.049> perfectly<00:01:14.440> round<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.580> then

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
times to get it perfectly round and then

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.550 
times to get it perfectly round and then
the<00:01:16.270> second<00:01:16.600> tricky<00:01:16.750> part<00:01:17.049> was<00:01:17.170> figuring<00:01:17.500> out

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
the second tricky part was figuring out

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.499 
the second tricky part was figuring out
how<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.710> mount<00:01:17.950> those<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.880> such<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.149> way<00:01:19.360> that

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
how to mount those in such a way that

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.760 
how to mount those in such a way that
they<00:01:19.600> wouldn't<00:01:19.780> fall<00:01:19.990> off<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.259> ship<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.740> I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
they wouldn't fall off the ship so I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.240 
they wouldn't fall off the ship so I
ended<00:01:20.979> up<00:01:21.100> putting<00:01:21.280> some<00:01:21.399> supports<00:01:21.940> on<00:01:22.119> there

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.060 

then<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:25.910> had<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.510> weight<00:01:26.840> issue<00:01:27.080> where<00:01:27.590> this

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
then I had a weight issue where this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.690 
then I had a weight issue where this
second<00:01:28.760> deck<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:29.360> heavy<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.710> bottom

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
second deck is so heavy that the bottom

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.280 
second deck is so heavy that the bottom
blue<00:01:31.880> part<00:01:32.150> there<00:01:32.300> started<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.720> break<00:01:32.900> in<00:01:33.080> half

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
blue part there started to break in half

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.020 
blue part there started to break in half
so<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.590> had<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.860> put<00:01:34.010> a<00:01:34.040> fifth<00:01:34.340> support<00:01:34.760> in<00:01:34.880> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
so I had to put a fifth support in to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.820 
so I had to put a fifth support in to
support<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.600> weight<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.410> back<00:01:36.560> end

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
support the weight of just the back end

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.969 
support the weight of just the back end
our<00:01:39.830> that's<00:01:40.040> some<00:01:40.250> serious<00:01:40.640> dedication<00:01:41.979> yeah

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
our that's some serious dedication yeah

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.440 
our that's some serious dedication yeah

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
it took a lot is a lot of time a lot of

it took a lot is a lot of time a lot of
hours<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> lot<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.140> work<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.619> had<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.640> recruit<00:01:46.970> my

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
hours a lot of work I had to recruit my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.850

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
nine years old the galaxies were yeah

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.390 
nine years old the galaxies were yeah
that's<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> Legos<00:02:23.120> original<00:02:24.010> space<00:02:25.010> set

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
that's what the Legos original space set

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270 
that's what the Legos original space set
from<00:02:25.670> 1978<00:02:26.360> if<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.230> were<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.410> buy<00:02:27.590> one<00:02:27.830> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
of them do spin manually but that's the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.410
