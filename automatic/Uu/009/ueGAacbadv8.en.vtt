00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 the safety for drivers of Mercedes Benz next to capitalized 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 the proven safety technologies arthritis 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.660
 Riesch himself agree, among other things, the car manufacturer presents the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
 Further development of the dead angle is known 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.820
 if you have a vehicle in the dead corner 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.670
 have driven then give it now in the outside mirror 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.470
 displayed over one 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.770
 EUR 2 warning light instead of simply staying if accidentally 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.420
 initiate a lane change so slightly in the direction of the vehicle in the dead 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.440
 Angle tend 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 then they also get a one-sided Wanzl intervention 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.070
 again on the one hand denied reports and warns and on the other whether already from 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.340
 the vehicle then easily way he leads so that 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 one can squint and touch can be avoided Dr 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.040
 The Active Blind Spot Assist is to warn the driver for a lane change 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.300
 Risk of collision threatens you looking for accidents to avoid 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.580
 the driver should not respond to the audible and displayed warnings 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 react and a vehicle comes dangerously close so engages the active 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.510
 Totwinkel-Assistent a through a braking intervention on the wheels of the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 opposite vehicle side there are no animal movements ideas 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
 Counteract collision course 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.230
 the joy as tenth and introduces 14 4 percent where today 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.210
 this avoids that he often happens inattentive or on off-road driving 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.770
 rejected drivers accidentally leave the lane 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 should be warned again in this case "We want integration 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.259
 and if he overruns a solid line what one 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219
 Highway Code is not allowed then gets one too 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.910
 active engagement a one-sided braking intervention 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.280
 because both normal additional warning and haptic feedback forms 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.850
 and on the other hand, the vehicle already again easily in the right lane 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 withdraws 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.240
 the Active Lane Keeping Assist system is activated 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.580
 because the driver unintentionally a solid line on the right or left 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.229
 the lane passes over 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.910
 an indication in the display warns the sale and the system slows down the sale 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.819
 opposite wheels from around the vehicle could thus rides the lines 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.459
 to prevent 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.180
 but this year for Mercedes Benz this is security assistant in the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.559
 Focus had to lead to the rides
