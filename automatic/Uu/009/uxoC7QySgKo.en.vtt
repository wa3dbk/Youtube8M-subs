so that way you guys can see the full

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.190 
so that way you guys can see the full
entity<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.940> know<00:01:08.030> how<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.180> electric<00:01:08.600> or

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
entity of you know how the electric or

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500 
entity of you know how the electric or
goes<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.310> only<00:01:10.400> difference<00:01:10.880> from<00:01:11.150> his<00:01:11.330> and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
goes the only difference from his and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.230 
goes the only difference from his and
mine<00:01:11.659> are<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.470> batteries<00:01:12.979> pretty<00:01:13.490> much<00:01:13.670> he

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
mine are the batteries pretty much he

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.370 
mine are the batteries pretty much he
has<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:14.780> mine

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
has on mine

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.520 
has on mine
mine<00:01:15.799> was<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.010> 75<00:01:16.820> see<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.270> told<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.840> guys<00:01:17.870> his

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
mine was a 75 see I told you guys his

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.020 
mine was a 75 see I told you guys his
was<00:01:18.710> pretty<00:01:18.740> much<00:01:19.010> almost<00:01:19.250> doubled<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.940> is

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
was pretty much almost doubled and it is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.100 
was pretty much almost doubled and it is
it's<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.330> 120<00:01:21.760> 120<00:01:22.760> C<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.210> these<00:01:23.299> run<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:23.630> series

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
it's a 120 120 C and these run in series

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.060 
it's a 120 120 C and these run in series
and<00:01:25.690> um<00:01:26.690> guess<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.500> will<00:01:27.590> probably<00:01:27.740> go<00:01:27.979> about

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
and um guess and will probably go about

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.520 
and um guess and will probably go about
five<00:01:28.340> or<00:01:28.490> 10<00:01:28.640> miles<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:29.510> these<00:01:29.659> two<00:01:29.930> these

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
five or 10 miles on just these two these

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.210 
five or 10 miles on just these two these
are<00:01:30.680> half<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.940> lab<00:01:32.180> they're<00:01:32.390> about<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:33.220> third

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
are half this lab they're about a third

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.820 
are half this lab they're about a third
of<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.460> size<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.180> they<00:01:35.869> fit<00:01:36.110> really<00:01:36.380> nice<00:01:36.619> and

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
of the size and they fit really nice and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.920 
of the size and they fit really nice and
neat<00:01:36.950> in<00:01:37.070> here<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.610> he<00:01:38.360> even<00:01:38.450> got<00:01:38.630> some<00:01:38.780> nice

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
neat in here and he even got some nice

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.370 
neat in here and he even got some nice
clips<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:40.340> go<00:01:40.490> in<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.420> we're<00:01:42.080> going<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.260> put

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
clips to go in so we're going to put

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.890 
clips to go in so we're going to put
this<00:01:42.470> back<00:01:42.650> together<00:01:43.030> we'll<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.510> test

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
this back together we'll do the test

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.570 
this back together we'll do the test
again<00:01:45.439> turning<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.040> motor<00:01:46.220> turning<00:01:46.460> on

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
again turning on the motor turning on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.010 
again turning on the motor turning on
the<00:01:46.640> remote<00:01:46.939> give<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.330> speed<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.900> then

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the remote give it a speed and then

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.820 
the remote give it a speed and then
we'll<00:01:48.439> flip<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.680> over<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.010> go<00:01:49.430> for<00:01:49.790> ride<00:01:50.830> all

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
we'll flip it over and go for ride all

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.289 
we'll flip it over and go for ride all
right<00:01:51.979> now<00:01:52.340> let's<00:01:52.520> turn<00:01:52.760> our<00:01:54.369> Steve<00:01:55.369> Ron<00:01:55.580> is

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
right now let's turn our Steve Ron is

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.859 
right now let's turn our Steve Ron is
here<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.659> motor<00:01:58.119> ok<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.330> now<00:01:59.420> let's<00:01:59.630> give

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
here in the motor ok and now let's give

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.179 
here in the motor ok and now let's give
it<00:01:59.900> here<00:02:00.290> put<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.590> remote<00:02:00.979> right<00:02:01.130> here

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
it here put the remote right here

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
it here put the remote right here
sitting<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.509> see<00:02:02.900> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.570 

we<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:07.960> power<00:02:08.170> alright<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.040> we'll<00:02:09.310> flip<00:02:09.430> it

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
we got power alright so we'll flip it
