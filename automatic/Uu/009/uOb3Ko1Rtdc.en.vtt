just<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.239> easily<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.440> traditional

just as easily as your traditional

healer<00:01:02.609> tank<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.210> dps<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.369> think<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
healer tank and dps I think this is a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
healer tank and dps I think this is a
great<00:01:06.510> idea<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> implement<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.130> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
great idea for them to implement and I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
great idea for them to implement and I
think<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> should<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.320> load

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
think it should take a lot of the load

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
think it should take a lot of the load
off<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.549> five-man<00:01:12.030> instances<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
off of the five-man instances and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.289 
off of the five-man instances and
hopefully<00:01:13.409> make<00:01:13.590> those<00:01:13.830> cues<00:01:14.189> faster<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
hopefully make those cues faster for the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.429 
hopefully make those cues faster for the
DPS<00:01:16.280> also<00:01:17.280> patch<00:01:17.970> notes<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.689> been<00:01:18.720> announced
