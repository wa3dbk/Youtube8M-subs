00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.980
 second part of me 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.049

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.280
 more food diary so big and i have 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 although you will now participate in this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 the food dishes I see that way 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.439
 would have eaten quite normal week 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 I had the last one done 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.929
 See the recipes I made and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.450
 I was so proud of you 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.000
 Normally this is the second part 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.340
 but I always like to be sweet 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.219
 I baked the breakfast then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.370
 and that's how the sweet cookies 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.829
 made from spelled raisins and oatmeal 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 were delicious when lunch was 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.559
 then fry potatoes with a bit 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.250

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.150
 Another major dix mussel bar 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 took 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.190
 Maybe I already had you there 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.630
 times these fruit pieces shown by 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 the same brand and that's it 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.160
 now I have to be year old then 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 only recently in the dm discovery the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.200
 are really delicious because they too 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.530
 not sweetened so only with apple 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.660
 sweet and old a normal sugar 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.580
 Then I was with taxis 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.940
 eat mensa and there our mensa yes 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.220
 unfortunately no free vegan food 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.010
 has the menu I want that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.700
 Our lay from the salad buffet 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.350
 put together and see you there 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.500
 then some chips and potato chips 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.480
 and I have to say that even if I'm real 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.640
 pretty sad about being with us in 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 the mensa no vegan food gives this 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.440
 Salable is just wonderful I go 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.000
 also so often in the mensa of 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.650
 The ehf not that you are good at noon 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 to eat salad but they have one 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 big choice and you see already 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 many green different salads 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.459
 corn sprouted tomatoes 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.810
 and what its all I ever lived and 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.849
 That's what you can do then 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.140
 put together and so has a choice 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.180
 of course not at home if you are 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.040
 Make a salad on top of each other 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.670
 keep out is salad that hand 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.590
 already much more expensive than in the mensa 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.569
 Since I am on the day of a long uni day 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.799

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.599

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 in such a coconut curry sauce and 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.099
 that he usually always 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.079
 when in fact that was like it but 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.209
 really a good option would be 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.609
 It can do that recipe to me 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.700
