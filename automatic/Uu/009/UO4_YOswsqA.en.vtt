00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
that and the other I needed like this i

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.439 
that and the other I needed like this i
need<00:04:29.410> like<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.090> design<00:04:31.240> it

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
need like that we can design it

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.659 
need like that we can design it
we<00:04:32.689> can<00:04:32.870> make<00:04:33.050> prototype<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.099> we<00:04:34.370> can<00:04:34.520> make

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
we can make prototype it and we can make

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.140 
we can make prototype it and we can make
it<00:04:34.849> all<00:04:34.999> in-house<00:04:35.270> very<00:04:35.870> quick<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:37.029> we<00:04:38.029> were

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
it all in-house very quick and we were

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.330 
it all in-house very quick and we were
requested<00:04:38.689> to<00:04:38.719> make<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> new<00:04:39.319> type<00:04:39.529> of<00:04:39.559> rail<00:04:39.949> for

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
requested to make a new type of rail for

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.499 
requested to make a new type of rail for
the<00:04:40.719> hk416<00:04:41.719> and<00:04:42.580> we<00:04:43.580> made<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.759> modular<00:04:44.300> type

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
the hk416 and we made a modular type

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.269 
the hk416 and we made a modular type
rail<00:04:44.749> and<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.229> it<00:04:45.349> right<00:04:45.499> here<00:04:45.559> except

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
rail and this is it right here except

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.239 
rail and this is it right here except
this<00:04:46.430> one<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:46.879> for<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.150> m4<00:04:47.900> we<00:04:48.710> made<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:48.979> version

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
this one is for the m4 we made a version

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.850 
this one is for the m4 we made a version
for<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.759> end<00:04:49.879> for<00:04:50.439> simultaneously<00:04:51.439> while<00:04:51.680> we

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
for the end for simultaneously while we

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.209 
for the end for simultaneously while we
were<00:04:52.009> designing<00:04:52.189> a<00:04:52.689> 416<00:04:53.689> rail<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:55.219 
were designing a 416 rail and the

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:56.939 
were designing a 416 rail and the
features<00:04:55.550> of<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:55.789> is<00:04:56.059> it<00:04:56.300> has<00:04:56.419> three

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
features of this is it has three

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.159 
features of this is it has three

nut it's very stiff so when you get a 15

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.200 
nut it's very stiff so when you get a 15
inch<00:07:14.570> tube<00:07:14.870> it's<00:07:15.380> still<00:07:15.830> going<00:07:16.010> to<00:07:16.070> be<00:07:16.130> a<00:07:16.520> very

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
inch tube it's still going to be a very

inch tube it's still going to be a very
stiff<00:07:17.540> tube<00:07:17.810> and<00:07:18.110> you're<00:07:18.290> not<00:07:18.410> going<00:07:18.590> to<00:07:18.650> have

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
stiff tube and you're not going to have

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.580 
stiff tube and you're not going to have
issues<00:07:19.220> at<00:07:19.460> the<00:07:19.970> other<00:07:20.120> end<00:07:20.420> with<00:07:21.050> reliability

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590 
issues at the other end with reliability
