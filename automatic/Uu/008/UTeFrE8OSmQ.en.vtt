00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
in the very same circumstances but how

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.810 
in the very same circumstances but how
we<00:06:27.020> as<00:06:27.170> actors<00:06:27.560> have<00:06:27.770> interpreted<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.580> roles

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
we as actors have interpreted the roles

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.300 
we as actors have interpreted the roles
in<00:06:29.210> the<00:06:29.360> pilot<00:06:29.900> episode<00:06:29.930> alone<00:06:30.380> now<00:06:31.130> when

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
in the pilot episode alone now when

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.770 
in the pilot episode alone now when
they've<00:06:31.430> written<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.820> season<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.450> show<00:06:32.630> has

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
they've written the season the show has

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.090 
they've written the season the show has
already<00:06:32.960> moved<00:06:33.380> in<00:06:33.530> a<00:06:33.590> very<00:06:33.770> different

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
already moved in a very different

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.490 
already moved in a very different
direction<00:06:34.190> because<00:06:34.790> they're<00:06:35.180> using<00:06:35.570> the

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
direction because they're using the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.230 
direction because they're using the
characters<00:06:36.890> we've<00:06:37.100> created<00:06:37.430> as<00:06:37.820> opposed<00:06:38.150> to

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
characters we've created as opposed to

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.510 
characters we've created as opposed to
trying<00:06:38.450> to<00:06:38.630> replicate<00:06:39.010> what<00:06:40.010> was<00:06:40.100> done<00:06:40.250> before

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
trying to replicate what was done before

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.430 
trying to replicate what was done before
so<00:06:40.790> our<00:06:40.880> show<00:06:41.060> will<00:06:41.240> deviate<00:06:41.540> in<00:06:41.960> a<00:06:42.170> lot<00:06:42.320> of

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
so our show will deviate in a lot of

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.370 
so our show will deviate in a lot of
ways<00:06:42.560> the<00:06:43.010> other<00:06:43.130> storyline<00:06:43.610> but<00:06:44.200> this<00:06:45.200> set

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
ways the other storyline but this set

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.470 
ways the other storyline but this set
ups<00:06:45.530> the<00:06:45.680> same<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.250> now<00:06:46.580> our<00:06:46.760> show<00:06:47.210> gets<00:06:47.390> to

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
ups the same and now our show gets to

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.600 
ups the same and now our show gets to
take<00:06:47.690> on<00:06:47.900> its<00:06:48.050> its<00:06:48.860> own<00:06:49.040> life<00:06:49.220> which<00:06:49.460> is<00:06:49.580> very
