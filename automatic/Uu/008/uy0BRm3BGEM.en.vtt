need<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> number<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.880> beads<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.329> your

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
need to have the number of beads on your

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.440 
need to have the number of beads on your
last<00:00:45.719> row<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:47.010> divisible<00:00:47.340> by<00:00:47.670> 5<00:00:49.579> as<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.790> know

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
last row be divisible by 5 as you know

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.850 
last row be divisible by 5 as you know
if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.260> circular<00:00:52.680> brick

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
if you know how to do circular brick

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
if you know how to do circular brick
stitch<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.850> pick<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.149> very

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
stitch or as you will pick up very

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
stitch or as you will pick up very
quickly<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.829> learning<00:00:56.239> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
quickly if you are just learning it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.479 
quickly if you are just learning it's
there's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.110> bit<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.289> wiggle<00:00:58.559> room<00:00:58.590> as

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
there's a little bit of wiggle room as

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
there's a little bit of wiggle room as
far<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.570> many<00:01:00.629> beads<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.680> fit<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
far as how many beads you fit into the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
far as how many beads you fit into the
spaces<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.110> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> play<00:01:04.650> around

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
spaces so you can kind of play around

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.609 
spaces so you can kind of play around
with<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> number<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> beads<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.350> add<00:01:07.470> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
with the number of beads that you add in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.770 
with the number of beads that you add in
the<00:01:07.650> number<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> rows<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.270> get

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the number of rows that you do to get

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.770 
the number of rows that you do to get
your<00:01:10.350> final<00:01:10.770> count<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> beads<00:01:11.400> divisible<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.299> 5

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your final count of beads divisible by 5

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.730 
your final count of beads divisible by 5
so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.340> done<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.780> piece<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so I have done this piece here and it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.609 
so I have done this piece here and it
has<00:01:16.890> 25<00:01:17.430> beads<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.150> outside<00:01:18.180> row<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
has 25 beads on the outside row so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
has 25 beads on the outside row so
that's<00:01:20.040> perfect<00:01:20.570> I'll<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.049> 5<00:01:22.409> beads<00:01:23.180> per

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's perfect I'll just do 5 beads per

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's perfect I'll just do 5 beads per
point<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:26.010> now<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.760> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.799> do<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
point so now you're going to do a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
point so now you're going to do a
regular<00:01:29.909> brick<00:01:30.360> stitch<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.020> you're<00:01:31.830> just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
regular brick stitch and you're just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100 
regular brick stitch and you're just
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.430> 5<00:01:33.030> beads<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> regular<00:01:33.900> brick

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
going to do 5 beads in a regular brick

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.420 
going to do 5 beads in a regular brick
stitch<00:01:34.350> along<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.990> same<00:01:37.380> edge<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> next

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
stitch along that same edge in the next

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.899 
stitch along that same edge in the next
row<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.960> always<00:01:43.500> start<00:01:43.799> brick<00:01:44.040> stitch<00:01:44.280> by

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
row so you always start brick stitch by

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.749 
row so you always start brick stitch by
adding<00:01:45.210> two<00:01:45.390> beads<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> skipping<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.350> first

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
adding two beads and skipping the first

00:01:46.759 --> 00:02:00.649 
adding two beads and skipping the first
the<00:01:47.759> thread<00:01:48.659> bridge<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.079> there

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.459 

and<00:02:01.200> don't<00:02:01.560> add<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.159> extra<00:02:02.520> beads<00:02:03.289> like<00:02:04.289> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
and don't add in extra beads like you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.130 
and don't add in extra beads like you
might<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.740> circular<00:02:05.490> brick<00:02:05.670> stitch<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.990> go

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
might in circular brick stitch just go

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.660 
might in circular brick stitch just go
ahead<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> stretch<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.399> along<00:02:08.640> because

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
ahead and and stretch them along because

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.979 
ahead and and stretch them along because
there's<00:02:09.179> they're<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.899> groups<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.319> five<00:02:11.989> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
there's they're just groups of five so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.790 
there's they're just groups of five so
it<00:02:13.170> won't<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.709> won't<00:02:13.890> make<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it won't it won't make it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.729 
it won't it won't make it
buckle<00:02:16.800> it'll<00:02:17.040> still<00:02:17.220> lay<00:02:17.340> flat<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.349> tried

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
buckle it'll still lay flat if you tried

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.009 
buckle it'll still lay flat if you tried
to<00:02:22.830> make<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> very<00:02:23.430> large<00:02:23.760> star<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.599> may<00:02:24.780> have

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
to make a very large star you may have

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.490 
to make a very large star you may have
to<00:02:25.230> add<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.400> extra<00:02:26.760> beads<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.200> you're

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
to add in extra beads but if you're

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.020 
to add in extra beads but if you're
doing<00:02:28.620> something<00:02:28.769> smaller<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.610> you're<00:02:29.910> only

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
doing something smaller and you're only

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.690 
doing something smaller and you're only
going<00:02:30.300> across<00:02:30.720> three<00:02:31.680> four<00:02:31.980> or<00:02:32.099> five<00:02:32.130> you're

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
going across three four or five you're

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
going across three four or five you're
probably<00:02:32.910> fine<00:02:35.209> okay<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.690> your<00:02:36.930> five<00:02:37.170> beads

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
probably fine okay so do your five beads

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.250 
probably fine okay so do your five beads
and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:38.040> you're<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.840> stop<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.080> do<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and then you're going to stop and do a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.729 
and then you're going to stop and do a
short<00:02:40.620> row<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:42.019> you're<00:02:43.019> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.319> continue

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
short row and you're going to continue

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.470 
short row and you're going to continue
to<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.150> brick<00:02:45.420> stitch<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:48.120> extra

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to do the brick stitch and then extra

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.539 
to do the brick stitch and then extra
above<00:02:48.750> those<00:02:48.900> five<00:02:49.140> beats<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.709> you're<00:02:49.950> going

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
above those five beats and you're going

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.850 
above those five beats and you're going
to<00:02:50.580> go<00:02:50.730> ahead<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> let<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.739> decreases<00:02:52.739> it

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
to go ahead and let it decreases it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:01.220 
to go ahead and let it decreases it
naturally<00:02:53.310> would<00:02:59.540> because<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.720> want<00:03:01.049> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
naturally would because we want that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.120 
naturally would because we want that
point<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:02.340> want<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.640> pointy<00:03:02.970> shape<00:03:03.150> so

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
point we want that pointy shape so

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.860 
point we want that pointy shape so
that's<00:03:05.130> why<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.459> stitch<00:03:06.150> works<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.630> well<00:03:06.840> for

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that's why this stitch works so well for

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:21.600 
that's why this stitch works so well for
this

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.310 

and<00:03:22.120> when<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.390> get<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> end<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.050> your<00:03:23.170> row

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
and when you get to the end of your row

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:47.370 
and when you get to the end of your row
just<00:03:24.220> turn<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.980> start<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.070> new<00:03:27.220> row

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.120 

and<00:03:47.920> turn<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> last<00:03:49.840> row<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
and turn and do the last row of the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.270 
and turn and do the last row of the
regular<00:03:51.490> brick<00:03:51.730> stitch<00:03:52.890> which<00:03:53.890> will<00:03:54.070> only

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
regular brick stitch which will only

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:04.920 
regular brick stitch which will only
have<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.850> two<00:03:55.830> beads<00:03:56.830> from<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.100> first<00:03:57.400> stitch

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.140 

then<00:04:05.930> you're<00:04:06.110> going<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.409> pick<00:04:07.129> up<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:08.120> bead

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
then you're going to pick up one bead

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.410 
then you're going to pick up one bead
and<00:04:09.489> go<00:04:10.489> back<00:04:10.790> down<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.930> side<00:04:13.330> opposite<00:04:14.330> of

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
and go back down the side opposite of

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.469 
and go back down the side opposite of
where<00:04:14.540> your<00:04:14.659> threads<00:04:14.900> coming<00:04:15.140> out<00:04:15.379> just

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
where your threads coming out just

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.350 
where your threads coming out just
through<00:04:17.479> those<00:04:17.720> beads<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:20.209> are<00:04:20.269> part<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
through those beads that are part of the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.520 
through those beads that are part of the
regular<00:04:23.360> brick<00:04:23.570> stitch<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.139> did<00:04:24.350> and

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
regular brick stitch you just did and

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.260 
regular brick stitch you just did and
you're<00:04:25.010> going<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.190> come<00:04:25.370> out<00:04:25.400> next<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.120> that

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
you're going to come out next to that

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.780 
you're going to come out next to that
last<00:04:26.479> row<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:27.020> beads<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.919> circular<00:04:28.639> brick

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
last row of beads in the circular brick

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.150 
last row of beads in the circular brick
stitch<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.260> when<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.440> pull<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.740> tight<00:04:30.919> you

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
stitch and when you pull it tight you

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.740 
stitch and when you pull it tight you
can<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.669> get<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:31.940> one<00:04:32.120> last<00:04:32.360> bead<00:04:32.630> that

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
can see you get that one last bead that

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.060 
can see you get that one last bead that
makes<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> nice<00:04:33.260> little<00:04:33.530> point<00:04:33.710> for<00:04:33.949> your

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
makes the nice little point for your

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.469 
makes the nice little point for your
star<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:35.650> then<00:04:36.650> before<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.070> start<00:04:38.030> again<00:04:38.300> on

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
star and then before you start again on

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.700 
star and then before you start again on
the<00:04:38.570> next<00:04:38.840> point<00:04:39.550> take<00:04:40.550> your<00:04:40.580> needle<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.240> go

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
the next point take your needle and go

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.740 
the next point take your needle and go
through<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.860> bead<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:44.270> inside<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:46.039> point

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
through the bead just inside the point

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.050 
through the bead just inside the point
in<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:48.740> last<00:04:48.949> row<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:52.010> then<00:04:52.550> you're<00:04:52.820> going

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
in that last row and then you're going

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.400 
in that last row and then you're going
to<00:04:54.100> go<00:04:55.100> back<00:04:55.880> up<00:04:56.150> towards<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.690> outside<00:04:57.110> in<00:04:57.350> the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
to go back up towards the outside in the

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.370 
to go back up towards the outside in the
next<00:04:57.949> one<00:04:58.250> over<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:02.120> now<00:05:02.720> you're<00:05:02.900> ready<00:05:03.080> to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
next one over and now you're ready to

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.070 
next one over and now you're ready to
make<00:05:03.740> your<00:05:04.039> next<00:05:04.340> point<00:05:04.820> so<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.180> will<00:05:05.449> go<00:05:05.630> just

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
make your next point so you will go just

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.320 
make your next point so you will go just
like<00:05:06.260> you<00:05:06.380> did<00:05:06.530> on<00:05:06.590> this<00:05:06.740> one<00:05:06.979> pick<00:05:07.970> up<00:05:08.150> two

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
like you did on this one pick up two

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.469 
like you did on this one pick up two
beads<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.720> start<00:05:09.139> a<00:05:09.289> row<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.310> ladder<00:05:11.150> stitch

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
beads and start a row of ladder stitch

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.990 
beads and start a row of ladder stitch
five<00:05:12.050> beads<00:05:12.349> long<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.830> go<00:05:13.370> back<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.789> forth

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
five beads long and go back and forth

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.450 
five beads long and go back and forth
and<00:05:14.599> you're<00:05:14.960> going<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.229> continue<00:05:15.710> around<00:05:16.010> if

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
and you're going to continue around if

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.969 
and you're going to continue around if
your<00:05:16.639> last<00:05:17.450> row<00:05:17.810> of<00:05:17.840> beads<00:05:18.200> was<00:05:18.440> divisible<00:05:18.919> by

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
your last row of beads was divisible by

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.670 
your last row of beads was divisible by
five<00:05:19.310> then<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.330> will<00:05:20.510> end<00:05:20.780> up<00:05:20.930> finishing

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
five then you will end up finishing

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.450 
five then you will end up finishing
right<00:05:22.280> where<00:05:22.820> you<00:05:23.539> started<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.200> you<00:05:25.160> will<00:05:25.280> end

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
right where you started and you will end

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.570 
right where you started and you will end
up<00:05:25.580> with<00:05:25.639> a<00:05:26.120> nice<00:05:26.510> even<00:05:26.780> star<00:05:27.310> when<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.340> go

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
up with a nice even star when you go

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.560 
up with a nice even star when you go
back<00:05:28.789> down<00:05:29.680> when<00:05:30.680> you're<00:05:30.919> done<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.430> then<00:05:32.419> you

back down when you're done and then you

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.680 
back down when you're done and then you
can<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:33.020> tie<00:05:33.979> off<00:05:34.160> your<00:05:34.190> ends<00:05:34.820> and<00:05:35.330> weave

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.170 
can just tie off your ends and weave
them<00:05:35.900> in<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.289> we<00:05:37.130> do<00:05:37.280> also<00:05:37.490> have<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.820> video<00:05:38.030> on
