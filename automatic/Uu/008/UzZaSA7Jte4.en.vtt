right here I think or this one that one
um<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.600> yeah<00:02:18.750> there's<00:02:19.350> definitely<00:02:19.470> some

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
um so yeah there's definitely some

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.770 
um so yeah there's definitely some
greens<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:20.880> really<00:02:21.330> close<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
greens in here that are really close to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.470 
greens in here that are really close to
this<00:02:22.100> as<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.489> see<00:02:23.730> they're<00:02:24.180> pretty

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
this as you can see they're pretty

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.979 
this as you can see they're pretty
similar<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:26.010> don't<00:02:26.670> want<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.390> buy<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
similar so if you don't want to buy the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.740 
similar so if you don't want to buy the
new<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:29.190> an<00:02:29.310> option<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.880> just

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
new one then that's an option I just

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
new one then that's an option I just
figured<00:02:31.019> I'd<00:02:31.080> let<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.319> guys<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.680> because

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
figured I'd let you guys know because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
figured I'd let you guys know because
don't<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.359> you<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.660> waste<00:02:33.840> money<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.440> you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
don't want you to waste money if you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.710
