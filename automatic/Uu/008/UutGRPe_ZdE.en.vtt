00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.100
 again the canine shepherd of the Pyrenees on the other hand 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.730
 Andean this is the shepherd of the Pyrenees 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.730
 elegant and striking that we look like polar bears 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 Known in Europe as shepherds of the Pyrenees 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.369
 these majestic giants get their name from the disused mountain 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.839
 extrefrance where they developed a very specific task 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.220
 treboll were used to care for flocks of sheep 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 instinctively careful with the smallest animals and the wounded 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.529
 these white hair balls are nocturnal by nature 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.040
 if it does not surprise us to see them sleep all day and guard their territory 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 overnight 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610
 but being a guardian considered is only talent 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.280
 they also have great resistance to walk long distances in play in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.750
 World War II these payments were used to transport goods from 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.710
 contraband through mountainous regions 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.050
 the sentence is more affectionate originated in central asia 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.170
 the bikini or asia and europe 500 years ago the 17th century these dogs look 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 imposing they protected the palaces of the French nobles 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.680
 in fact in 1675 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.780
 the king ruiz 14 proclaimed the shepherd of the Pyrenees but real of France 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.090
 even today its appearance is impeccable 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.060
 his double coat to proof of any climate is of a single color 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.170
 white are through keys is it can have brown or cream spots 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 it was almost v-shaped if they are stuck to the head 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 and while most dogs have a single spur on their legs 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 front 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.330
 the shepherd of the Pyrenees is one of the few who have double spurs in the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.220
 hind legs this says that they used to climb the slopes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 from the mountains when he looked after the flocks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.960
 these shepherds of the Pyrenees do not shout mountains but also more than three thousand 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.700
 kilometers for a cause much more important than themselves and in truth 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 I think they understand what we're doing 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 the interim his loyal most friends and short pants have a vision 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.240
 a mission to discover the cause of canine cancer 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 his crusade is called two dogs three thousand kilometers 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:13.689
 with each step they create awareness about an illness and caused the death of one 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.439
 every four dogs 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.439
 Huc's passion for this cause is deeply personal 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.739
 his first dog a shepherd of the Pyrenees called malcolm 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.209
 died of bone cancer in 2006 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.730
 when he marked his absence died he destroyed all 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 2 for it 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.159
 but according to 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.159
 workshops 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.210
 the pain for the death of malcolm was so great 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.320
 that what I needed to do something equally important to recover 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.950
 and he undertook a walk to raise awareness about cancer with 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.149
 his other two dogs from the city of austin texas 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.819
 up to boston massachusetts 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.069
 for more than two years this former executive consultant and his devout dogs 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.769
 traveled between 13 and 19 kilometers per day through 14 states 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.569
 nor all kinds of clients 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.319
 once we start walking they feel happy for them it's life 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.899
 perfect 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.710
 I did not realize last week 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.290
 every two or three months he takes his dogs to a local veterinarian to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.360
 make sure of your health and continue the journey all the legs also walks 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.379
 while they walk martifer solar wear boots to protect their legs from heat 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.579
 extreme the ice and the risks of cities but like most of the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.889
 children who are eager to take them off 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.889
 also because I do not take it off if I know 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.589
 most days the three friends walk alone 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.400
 I have informed the world about the trip and about its mission through Facebook and 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.399
 twitter objects the two there went very well 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.999
 and during their journey they manage to attract the attention of the public and organize themselves 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.659
 group walks as happened in Houston with ethics 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.049
 the support that two dogs received three thousand kilometers was amazing 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.869
 each one for Moscow 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.509
 and another for Brazil 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:07.479
 the garden family was so moved after seeing luque television that 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:11.039
 he offered him and his canine companions a place to stay while 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.989
 were connected on occasions families like the gardens offer them 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.479
 stay in their homes a very well 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.129
 but a store by the side of the road is what this nomadic group usually 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.259
 home flame indeed point a kiss the choirs the haunting 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.159
 with a destination in the villa lucy his friends continue to advance tirelessly in 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.740
 your crusade against canine cancer 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.249
 but it does not matter how many kilometers traveled 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.979
 Luc will never forget an endearing creature in honor of which he walks 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.490
 small and thanks to our efforts I find a cure for cancer 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.189
 they should carry the brand 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.189
 then the boys behaved very well today 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.379
 if the shepherd of the Pyrenees is not an apartment dog these guardians 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.210
 born needs regular exercise a fenced space to control their 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.219
 mule tendency 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.520
 with respect to your health 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.349
 like many other large breeds are prone to get cancer in the stage 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.729
 especially bone cancer detailed that the shepherds of the 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.750
 Pyrenees also suffer from arthritis as the nuance bus 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.900
 because they carry a huge weight on their legs and tend to be overweight 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.240
 so it's important to monitor them and keep them in shape 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.809
 because the board dogs suffer from arthritis about three or four years before 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.809
 that dogs that are in pesos 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.569
 with those fights that these dogs have but all the time 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.300
 in autumn and spring they need more frequent brushing 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.099
 you personally personally I find it very relaxing arrival of brushing have 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.290
 presented especially to one as the pastor of the first 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.770
 that side is removed because we can support it while we read a 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.550
 TV book hahaha is very relaxing home only for the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.800
 people but also for the pnv it seems that it can be another way to 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 strengthen the bond between the dog and us 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.249
 If you are looking for a dog specialist in doing tricks 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.589
 the shepherd of the Pyrenees is not the one 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.439
 independent and carefree can be difficult to train if you do not start 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.719
 the sooner she was definitely have an independent spirit like that 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:09.889
 start soon 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.240
 But if you have a lot of patience you can certainly deliver them 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.960
 as family pets 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.190
 can count on that these beautiful giants will be loyal and protective they are 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.779
 very sweet nature 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:24.840
 in summary 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.969
 they need a fenced space and daily exercises 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.929
 suffer from health problems typical of large breeds need brushing 

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.629
 weekly and can be difficult to train 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.069
 they are patient with the children and very affectionate
