00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.560 

this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> battery<00:01:08.549> pack<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> gun<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
this is the battery pack for the gun and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
this is the battery pack for the gun and
then<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> gun<00:01:13.049> wait<00:01:13.830> wait<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.790> a

then the gun wait wait they have a
daring<00:01:15.509> rod<00:01:15.689> said<00:01:16.470> anything<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.950> stuck<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
daring rod said anything it's stuck in

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.340 
daring rod said anything it's stuck in
Barrow<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
Barrow and this is something for the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
Barrow and this is something for the
like<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.650> battery<00:01:23.009> tack<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.850> pretty<00:01:24.210> sure

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
like this battery tack I'm pretty sure

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.030 
like this battery tack I'm pretty sure
this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> battery<00:01:24.869> pack<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> laser

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
this is a battery pack and it's a laser

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.179 
this is a battery pack and it's a laser
so<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.090> wrong<00:01:30.390> tell<00:01:30.780> me<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:32.009> I'm

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so if I'm wrong tell me because I'm

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.149 
so if I'm wrong tell me because I'm
pretty<00:01:32.340> sure<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.820> laser<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> here

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
pretty sure the laser can go in here

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
pretty sure the laser can go in here
right<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.759> hole<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.240> then

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
right in there in that hole and then

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
right in there in that hole and then
battery<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.259> along<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> side<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.490> I'm

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
battery can go along the side but I'm

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.030 
battery can go along the side but I'm
not<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.820> sure<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.360> comment<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.320> if

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
not really sure on comment if you if

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
not really sure on comment if you if
it's<00:01:41.220> something<00:01:41.400> else<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:41.850> i<00:01:42.060> really

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's something else because i really

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
it's something else because i really
like<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:44.040> you've<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.460> been

waiting for ICS exp 08 concept rifle
this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.530> gun<00:01:54.049> it's<00:01:55.049> full<00:01:55.619> metal<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.969> its

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
this is the gun it's full metal from its

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
this is the gun it's full metal from its
barrel<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.799> its<00:01:58.979> stock<00:01:59.369> has<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.560> six-point

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
barrel to its stock has a six-point

barrel to its stock has a six-point
adjustable<00:02:02.219> stock<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.619> sights<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:06.149> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
adjustable stock it's got sights this is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.229 
adjustable stock it's got sights this is
a<00:02:06.420> rail<00:02:06.780> system<00:02:07.020> these<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.670> different

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
a rail system these are there different

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.699 
a rail system these are there different
I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> put<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.319> scope<00:02:10.560> here

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I think you put a little scope here

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.340 
I think you put a little scope here
probably<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> sniper<00:02:12.180> scope<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:12.810> I'm

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
probably like a sniper scope there I'm

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
probably like a sniper scope there I'm
probably<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> be<00:02:13.800> putting<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:14.190> slowest

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
probably going to be putting my slowest

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.580 
probably going to be putting my slowest
arms<00:02:15.060> red<00:02:15.210> dot<00:02:15.360> sight<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.840> maybe<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.290> sniper

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
arms red dot sight here maybe my sniper

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.330 
arms red dot sight here maybe my sniper
scope<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> utg<00:02:20.070> brand

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
scope that I got that is a utg brand

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.420 
scope that I got that is a utg brand
they<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.330> picatinny<00:02:21.900> rails<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:22.440> along<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
they have picatinny rails all along the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.090 
they have picatinny rails all along the
sides<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:25.380> looks<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:25.950> put<00:02:26.070> a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
sides this looks like you can put a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.160 
sides this looks like you can put a
silencer<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.000> um<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:30.170> semi

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
silencer on that um this is the semi
