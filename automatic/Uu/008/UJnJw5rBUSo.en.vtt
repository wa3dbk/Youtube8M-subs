as<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:59.250> bar<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> run

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
as you can see my bar is about to run

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.090 
as you can see my bar is about to run
out<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> ads<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> be

out and so all the ads are going to be

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.410 
out and so all the ads are going to be
around<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.270> is

around me and so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> couple<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.409> fan<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I'm just going to do a couple of fan of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.039 
I'm just going to do a couple of fan of
knives<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.610> basically<00:02:06.090> translate<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> for

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
knives which basically translate to for

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
knives which basically translate to for
anybody<00:02:07.320> else<00:02:07.439> any<00:02:07.710> other<00:02:08.160> AoE<00:02:08.610> attack<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
anybody else any other AoE attack and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
anybody else any other AoE attack and
again<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.229> want<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> click<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.890> orb

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
again you want to click this orb

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
again you want to click this orb
once<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:12.300> click<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
once you do one click and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.040 
once you do one click and
times<00:02:13.350> there's<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> delay<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.390> basically<00:02:15.390> if

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
times there's a delay and basically if

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.230 
times there's a delay and basically if
you<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.010> double-click<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.880> something

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
you if you double-click it you something

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.550 
you if you double-click it you something
you<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> debuff<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.110> where<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> can't

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you get a debuff to where you can't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.290 
you get a debuff to where you can't
click<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.160> over<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.580> over<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.910> over<00:02:20.970> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
click it like over and over and over and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.970 
click it like over and over and over and
just<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.540> Greek<00:02:21.780> control<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.320> over<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
just a Greek control them like over and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.700 
just a Greek control them like over and
over<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:25.080> don't<00:02:25.260> want<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> double

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
over and so you don't want to double

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.690 
over and so you don't want to double
click<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.980> because<00:02:26.190> sometimes<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.610> will

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
click it because sometimes it will

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.740 
click it because sometimes it will
cancel<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.230> control<00:02:28.560> channel<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
cancel the the control channel and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.850 
cancel the the control channel and
anyway<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> can<00:02:31.020> see<00:02:31.200> I'm<00:02:31.380> taking<00:02:31.530> pretty

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
is that he will he'll just he'll explode

there's<00:02:47.340> no<00:02:47.459> way<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.640> prevent<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
there's no way to prevent this this is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
there's no way to prevent this this is
what<00:02:48.900> happens<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:50.070> other<00:02:50.190> way<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> wipe

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
what happens and the other way to wipe

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.800 
what happens and the other way to wipe
is<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.700> actually<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.270> was<00:02:54.420> actually<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
is if you actually that was actually the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.870 
is if you actually that was actually the
main<00:02:54.930> way<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> wipe<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.100> kill<00:02:56.670> him

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
main way to wipe is if you kill him

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
main way to wipe is if you kill him
before<00:02:57.090> all<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> eggs<00:02:57.780> are<00:02:57.959> destroyed<00:02:58.320> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
before all the eggs are destroyed and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.350 
before all the eggs are destroyed and
you'll<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.670> when<00:02:59.820> all<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> eggs<00:03:00.209> are

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
you'll know when all the eggs are

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.970 
you'll know when all the eggs are
destroyed<00:03:00.690> because<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> ads<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.680> run<00:03:01.860> away

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
destroyed because the ads will run away

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.360 
destroyed because the ads will run away
and<00:03:02.280> you'll<00:03:02.610> lose<00:03:02.790> control<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.510> guy

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
and you'll lose control of the guy

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.650 
and you'll lose control of the guy
whenever<00:03:05.370> you're<00:03:05.550> controlling<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.239> razor

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
whenever you're controlling the razor

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.540 
whenever you're controlling the razor
Gore<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.320> want<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> kind<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.980> set<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> path

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
Gore you want to kind of set a path

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720 
Gore you want to kind of set a path
