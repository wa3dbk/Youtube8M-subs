Phillips plastic this plastic bar

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.540 
Phillips plastic this plastic bar
actually<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.590> makes<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.610> easier<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:40.550> pry

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
actually is makes it a lot easier to pry

actually is makes it a lot easier to pry
the<00:00:41.780> trims<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.370> both<00:00:44.370> side<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> steering

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the trims on both side of the steering

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.060 
the trims on both side of the steering
column<00:00:47.000> Torx<00:00:48.000> number<00:00:48.329> ten<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.890> has

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
column Torx number ten now this one has

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.389 
column Torx number ten now this one has
shaped<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> star<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> tip<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.399> they

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
shaped like a star on the tip and they

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.560 
shaped like a star on the tip and they
call<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> either<00:00:57.170> t10<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.530> Torx<00:00:59.300> number<00:01:00.300> ten

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
call it either t10 or Torx number ten

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.469 
call it either t10 or Torx number ten
and<00:01:01.430> maybe<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.640> regular<00:01:03.239> flathead<00:01:08.210> first<00:01:09.210> thing

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and maybe a regular flathead first thing

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.030 
and maybe a regular flathead first thing
that<00:01:09.630> needs<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.140> done<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that needs to be done is actually you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.149 
that needs to be done is actually you
make<00:01:14.250> sure<00:01:14.689> you're<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> certain<00:01:16.140> column<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.920> all

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
make sure you're a certain column is all

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.149 
make sure you're a certain column is all
the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:22.159> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the way out and all the way down that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.690 
the way out and all the way down that
way<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.610> plenty<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.180> room<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:25.250> work<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
way you have plenty of room to work on

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
way you have plenty of room to work on
your<00:01:26.850> cluster

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.190 

now<00:01:32.200> we're<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.400> start<00:01:33.700> with<00:01:34.200> removing

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
now we're going to start with removing

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.760 
now we're going to start with removing
the<00:01:35.380> two<00:01:35.620> trims<00:01:35.980> on<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:37.660> side<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the two trims on the side of the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.890 
the two trims on the side of the
steering<00:01:39.070> column<00:01:39.340> they're<00:01:39.760> about<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.360> know

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
steering column they're about you know

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.450 
steering column they're about you know
five<00:01:41.110> or<00:01:41.290> six<00:01:41.530> inches<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:47.020> start<00:01:47.460> with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
five or six inches and we can start with

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.370 
five or six inches and we can start with
the<00:01:48.580> driver's<00:01:49.000> side<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.860> left<00:01:51.460> side

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.160 

basically<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:58.009> can<00:01:58.220> pull<00:01:58.490> them<00:01:58.640> out<00:01:58.790> babies

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:16.770 

and<00:02:04.180> same<00:02:05.180> thing<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.310> right<00:02:07.700> hand<00:02:07.759> side

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.990 

once<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.989> have<00:02:18.170> them<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.470> there<00:02:20.290> are<00:02:22.000> one

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
once you have them out there are one

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
once you have them out there are one
Phillip<00:02:24.130> Phillips<00:02:25.130> screw<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.670> one<00:02:25.940> side<00:02:26.239> and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
Phillip Phillips screw on one side and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.340 
Phillip Phillips screw on one side and
there<00:02:27.860> are<00:02:28.069> two<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.980> left<00:02:31.220> side<00:02:32.170> most<00:02:33.170> of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
there are two on the left side most of

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.040 
there are two on the left side most of
the<00:02:33.470> time<00:02:33.709> they<00:02:34.610> hold<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> trim<00:02:35.360> around<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the time they hold the trim around the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.559 
the time they hold the trim around the
cluster<00:02:36.350> most<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> time<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.569> broken

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
cluster most of the time they are broken

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.059 
cluster most of the time they are broken
well<00:02:39.050> we're<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.590> go<00:02:39.769> ahead<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
well we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.650 
well we're just going to go ahead and
you<00:02:40.640> know<00:02:40.730> pretend<00:02:41.150> they're<00:02:41.300> not<00:02:41.480> broken

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
you know pretend they're not broken

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:53.940 
you know pretend they're not broken
we're<00:02:42.019> going<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.350> ahead<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> open

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.540 

so<00:02:54.550> once<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.030> remove<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:56.020> three<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.560> them<00:02:59.550> you

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
so once you remove all three of them you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.440 
so once you remove all three of them you
can<00:03:00.790> go<00:03:01.030> ahead<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.950> pull<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.310> bracket<00:03:03.520> out

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
can go ahead and pull the bracket out

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.839 
can go ahead and pull the bracket out
I'm<00:03:05.319> sorry<00:03:05.680> getting<00:03:06.040> ready<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.520> pull<00:03:06.700> the

I'm sorry getting ready to pull the
bracket<00:03:07.270> out<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.890> we're<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.610> need<00:03:09.819> to

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
bracket out then we're going to need to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.820 
bracket out then we're going to need to
remove<00:03:10.950> three<00:03:13.590> Torx<00:03:14.590> number<00:03:15.040> ten<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.610> top<00:03:16.830> as

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
remove three Torx number ten on top as

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.259 
remove three Torx number ten on top as
you<00:03:17.890> can<00:03:18.190> see<00:03:18.400> they're<00:03:20.670> not<00:03:21.670> easy<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.000> see
