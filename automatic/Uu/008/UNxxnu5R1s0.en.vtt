00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
can see me adjusting it back and forth

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.210 
can see me adjusting it back and forth
this<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.050> gonna<00:05:47.170> be<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.410> savior<00:05:47.770> this<00:05:48.040> is<00:05:48.130> gonna

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
this is gonna be a savior this is gonna

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.890 
this is gonna be a savior this is gonna
be<00:05:48.400> an<00:05:48.490> insane<00:05:48.820> switch<00:05:49.270> but<00:05:49.480> it's<00:05:49.630> literally

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
be an insane switch but it's literally

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.380 
be an insane switch but it's literally
that<00:05:50.110> easy<00:05:50.350> just<00:05:50.650> put<00:05:50.860> tied<00:05:51.070> into<00:05:51.280> slot<00:05:51.760> it's

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
that easy just put tied into slot it's

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.000 
that easy just put tied into slot it's
gonna<00:05:52.540> take<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.870> tight<00:05:53.230> in<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.590> put<00:05:53.800> them<00:05:53.920> in

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
gonna take a tight in and put them in

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.500

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
that slot receiver right there so you

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.480 
that slot receiver right there so you
have<00:05:55.600> actually<00:05:56.260> two<00:05:56.470> tight<00:05:56.740> ends<00:05:56.980> blocking

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
is a great tip at a great switch because

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.630 
is a great tip at a great switch because
it<00:06:01.450> only<00:06:01.570> takes<00:06:01.870> literally<00:06:02.260> a<00:06:02.290> second<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.520> by

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
it only takes literally a second and by

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.770 
it only takes literally a second and by
the<00:06:03.730> time<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.060> call<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.360> play<00:06:04.510> your<00:06:04.690> opponent

the time you call the play your opponent

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.390 
the time you call the play your opponent

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
you want to go full blocks basically you

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.960 
you want to go full blocks basically you
can<00:06:44.560> hit<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.800> right<00:06:44.980> bumper<00:06:45.310> here<00:06:45.670> is<00:06:45.760> the

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
can hit the right bumper here is the

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.240 
can hit the right bumper here is the
subs<00:06:46.270> right<00:06:46.540> there<00:06:46.770> you<00:06:47.770> can<00:06:47.890> hit<00:06:47.950> the<00:06:48.070> right

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
subs right there you can hit the right

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.430 
subs right there you can hit the right
bumper<00:06:48.550> now<00:06:49.120> in<00:06:49.300> this<00:06:49.480> formation<00:06:49.870> where<00:06:50.290> the

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
bumper now in this formation where the

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.050 
bumper now in this formation where the
tight<00:06:50.650> end<00:06:50.920> is<00:06:51.130> you<00:06:51.550> can<00:06:51.700> actually<00:06:51.880> put

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
tight end is you can actually put

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.880 
tight end is you can actually put
alignment<00:06:52.870> so<00:06:52.960> I<00:06:52.990> like<00:06:53.170> to<00:06:53.290> put<00:06:53.440> an<00:06:53.530> offensive

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
alignment so I like to put an offensive

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.640 
alignment so I like to put an offensive
lineman<00:06:54.250> there<00:06:54.610> for<00:06:55.030> a<00:06:55.210> lot<00:06:55.450> of<00:06:55.510> times<00:06:55.900> if<00:06:56.530> you

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
lineman there for a lot of times if you

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.200 
lineman there for a lot of times if you
want<00:06:56.860> better<00:06:56.980> blocks<00:06:57.400> you<00:06:57.580> can<00:06:57.640> also<00:06:57.850> take<00:06:58.150> a

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
want better blocks you can also take a

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.670 
want better blocks you can also take a
tight<00:06:58.510> end<00:06:58.690> and<00:06:58.810> put<00:06:58.990> them<00:06:59.080> in<00:06:59.170> the<00:06:59.260> slot<00:06:59.500> like

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
tight end and put them in the slot like

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.860 
tight end and put them in the slot like
I<00:06:59.860> said<00:07:00.130> and<00:07:00.970> then<00:07:01.090> you<00:07:01.150> can<00:07:01.300> put<00:07:01.450> a<00:07:01.480> tight<00:07:01.750> end

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.480 
I said and then you can put a tight end
on<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.110> right<00:07:02.290> side<00:07:02.530> as<00:07:02.710> well<00:07:02.920> right<00:07:02.950> here<00:07:03.340> but
