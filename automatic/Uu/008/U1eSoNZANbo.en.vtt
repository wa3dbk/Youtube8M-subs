00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.049
 good your fears to a good new video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 we go to a news recently that good 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.440
 I found it quite interesting for 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.990
 comment a few things this channel 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 is obviously videogame is not going about 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.469
 anime movies and others but good 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.460
 There was a good reason to talk about 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.499
 the video games of dragon ball 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.739
 taking advantage of the fact that today it has been announced that 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.539
 good we will see a new movie in 2015 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.479
 of dragon ball z where he will be 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 involved akira toriyama again in 

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:29.130
 well the movie has been announced 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 the magazine of the month of September 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 dv jump and good basically like the snowflake 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.179
 would be released in 2015 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.679
 I wanted to talk a bit about this whole topic 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.000
 of the dragonball video games and 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.710
 others taking advantage as I say this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 news we are going to have a new movie 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.969
 we already set aside a bit also the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 last that they took out was released recently 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 in the cinemas of Spain is not copied and what 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.920
 opinion you have of the movie only 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.230
 you can put it in the description if 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.269
 you want critic in the comments if 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.769
 you want but do not want to talk a bit about 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.999
 the games and the quality of the games 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.769
 dragon ball lately 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.019
 you know that it has been announced not new 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.629
 the dragon ball but bears you have a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.579
 complete in the description I'll leave you 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.560
 one so that you have one eye on the 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.390
 that already the people because it has enough 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.640
 hopes put will be the first of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.280
 next generation that we will see in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.479
 consoles with graphics renewed me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.219
 it really is a little note 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.290
 It does not matter either that you notice a lot 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.630
 and after the great reception that has 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.549
 had in the channel dragon ball z budokai 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 tenkaichi 3 that for me in my opinion is 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.259
 the best dragon ball game for now so 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 modern we could say it's uncertain to see 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.399
 some so retro that are also good 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.439
 but as I say, that's the best 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.270
 the modern ones we could say that they have 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.759
 removed the date or none of prison 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.259
 3 neither of nor of precision 4 nor of nothing 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.649
 he has not yet overcome in my 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.030
 opinion to that one that already has enough 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.619
 aÃ±itos and I think that the beta showed 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.899
 also in the comments on the likes 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 and others with your opinions and everything 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.060
 this my question is quite simple is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.200
 so hard this really creates a game 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 of same conditions of it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 quality that dragon ball z so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.979
 you have and three are so difficult 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.380
 so fucking done a group is it seems 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.850
 I know that if we do not see in any 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.289
 new of these characteristics seems 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.720
 be that yes I think it would be very very 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.940
 simple copy the same game really 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.870
 put the characters by a template 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220
 same 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.080
 of characters that is a barbarity to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.280
 the characters there are and good new 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.319
 attacks I do not think it's that hard 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.450
 catch the most mechanical the same game 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.370
 we could say renew the graphics and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.930
 make a game in conditions and take out 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 that they would surely have better 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.319
 sales also welcomed for the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.049
 public especially for the public that 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.420
 what you are asking for years and years 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.129
 And years are the opinions of others 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.720
 but most others as saying by 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.230
 you want to see a game like that again 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.299
 characteristics of those conditions and of 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.129
 that quality we could say I do not know if it's 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.989
 not seeing will be that game that both 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.430
 we are waiting for good dragon ball 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.140
 but what is certain is that this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.849
 it always happens as with what you have it up to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.920
 that we do not play it we do not know if it's good 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.109
 or bad is not always the same teach us 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.370
 gold what they want to teach us but 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.500
 until we play it because we do not know 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.390
 whether it is the definitive or not I really the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.609
 pint that you have is not bad logically 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.769
 but I do not see it I do not see it at the height of 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.709
 as I say of that mythical game of crisis 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.019
 they are two that already named several times 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.569
 I think it would be very good for the saga 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.659
 that this saga of games is saga dragon 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.790
 ball would take it cyberconnect2 the 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.050
 responsible for the latest games 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.670
 Naruto monkey of her 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.620
 Naruto game I think you can do 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.050
 a pretty good job a game 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.790
 similar someone to the features already 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.320
 the naruto mechanics of dragon ball 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.730
 I think it would be quite successful 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.340
 something different if what you do not want 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.680
 to do is something similar to budokai 3 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.260
 well, do that and I think there would be 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.600
 as gods the truth md trunk then 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.670
 using teleportation as a button 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.050
 defense and other final attacks 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.390
 these also make them at the same 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.440
 mechanical circle triangle twice 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.970
 circle triangle I do not know that kind of this 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.070
 kind of cool things that were cool 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.330
 so much in naruto because they can put them in 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.180
 the dragon ball games I think that 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.030
 it would be totally epic I do not know what you think 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.770
 you but I think it would be very 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.090
 good very good for the saga now that 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.650
 It is both fashionable which will take 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.970
 now that they have taken out in Spain recently 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.820
 the movie and they are going to make a movie 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.920
 in 2015 and 1 game I think they should 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.390
 rethink a bit all this and do it 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 really good I think that if I connected 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.220
 I would be very happy to receive this 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.260
 saga really do not know if they want or not 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.910
 they want but as I say 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.520
 I believe that the limp in arms 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.680
 super open and I would like very much 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.630
 to make a game in conditions I say 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.540
 seriously and a perfect game will come out 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.890
 it makes a pretty pretty good game of 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.420
 a pretty good quality us 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.680
 come back from all this we have been 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.840
 liked the last dragon ball 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.090
 really where they tend to sell a lot 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.650
 these games are in japan and I do not know if the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.820
 quality matters or not the amounts 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.860
 they are have moments are not having 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.060
 sales but still true that 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.560
 European public and is it and 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.900
 American is not what we ask 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.460
 we ask for a game in conditions and we do not 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.410
 they are really giving it so I do not know 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.750
 what is going to happen from here to 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.340
 some years we will really see the physio not 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.860
 see if it's the game we're waiting for 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.610
 or not and nothing were in the next 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.610
 video until the next 8
