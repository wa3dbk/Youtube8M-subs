00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.650
 we have an ultra wide angle again 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.150
 objective in the test and not by canon 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.389
 or nikon or tamron but of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 fujifilm that 10 to 24 mm throughout 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.210
 with aperture 4 and optical 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.620
 bildstabilisator so you have curious 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 what she has on it and what she does with it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 for pictures could conjure just under 1000 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.770
 euro would have to be for the objective of the time 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 lie down as well as the manufacturer vp there 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.029
 Of course you are already expecting things 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 Processing design you get a lot 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 In my opinion, at least very much 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 a lot of metal very much fancier 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
 focus ring lets very chic zoomring 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.450
 So everything turns very nicely small 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 Special feature but the one at fujifilm 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.200
 every once in a while finds it here 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 even the ring to understand the aperture 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.170
 but you can switch off so 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 then just click on the automatic again 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.649
 go back direct lens metal 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 Of course, bayonet should not 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 missing in the price range so said 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
 in things design processing ever 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 Definitely worth the money a lot 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 high quality piece of technology only the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 lens hood is me somehow 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.980
 personally a bit too loose off 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.270
 So do not click here properly 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 that bothered me a bit now 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 otherwise 72 mm filter thread is front 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.719
 relatively large for the light intensity of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 objectively that means filter will be yes 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.150
 already a bit more expensive but 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.290
 I guess that bothers us maybe 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.970
 the least in the ultra wide angle 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 You usually do not do that area 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 such an expensive picture as for example 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 polfilter image quality of the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 objective as great a highlight as 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.150
 In terms of processing was now 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.619
 times hamburg have got there while 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 a workshop at samsung rum 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 photographed documentation of that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.170
 workshop itself link to the workshop 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.549
 Incidentally, you will find there one more time 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.200
 in against photography, after all 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.460
 necessarily daily time I was there 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.810
 pretty hot and a big one 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.729
 advantage if you even now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 out goes architecture photographed that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.939
 Objectively recorded even at 10 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.290
 millimeters as good as not at all 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.150
 So still very nice 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.710
 straight lines must be so afterwards 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.119
 also do not do too much work 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 only to the edge it will be quite 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.090
 slightly out of focus you can but also 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 in the block converter actually still good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 so also fix image quality really 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.720
 good objective have many alternatives 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.189
 you do not even for the footpath there 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.659
 It does not stop too much objective 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.229
 then we have to clear about adapter 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.969
 connect 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 but if an ultra wide angle lens 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.540
 I'm looking for fujifilm a lot 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.159
 he should be high quality since he opened here 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.750
 every case ever right one 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.189
 optical image stabilizer has that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.700
 Objectively synonymous with it in the already has 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.590
 mentioned 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.899
 Of course you have to say you have 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.170
 with 10 to 24 mm, of course, very much 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.910
 very little shake 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.530
 but also now that it is very cold 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.060
 say my hands are shaking a bit 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.319
 The camera can do a lot more with it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 very much I have already 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.910
 set to 24 mm and so times the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.599
 maximum focal length at the lens 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 get 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.290
 but it's really very, very nice to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.760
 while still photographing wood 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.830
 bit out even if I have to say 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.239
 I did not find the effect that big 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.100
 For example , yesterday I was 20 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.750
 had photographed the millimeters 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.300
 bildstabilisator other already at one 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.709
 56 seconds, for example, the picture begins 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.090
 to be slowly embassy 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.620
 So I think it's almost for 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.819
 the video operation is even more interesting 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.170
 for that, of course, then again 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.459
 Pretty good at filming too 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.950
 actually only the missing ones are missing 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.980
 matching video the slm is just times 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.180
 From fuji just under 1000 euros you can do so 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.769
 spend a lot for an ultra wide angle 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.630
 objective in the case of fujifilm 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.310
 most likely yes then as already 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.080
 mentioned the choice is not too 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.299
 big is the processing and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 picture quality really great so nothing can 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.850
 against say also the optical 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.830
 Image stabilizer is really great if he 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.660
 An objective addiction looks in any case 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.580
 We'll have it over here too 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.350
 for example the canon 16 35mm 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.750
 tested as well as the ten to 18 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.310
 millimeter the system is 18 one more 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.810
 whole corner cheap work only for 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.400
 canon city but also like it again 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.540
 purely that was so far from me many thanks 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.540
 for the state and until then
