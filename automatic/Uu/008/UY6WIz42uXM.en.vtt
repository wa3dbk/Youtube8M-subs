00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.490
 so what are we preparing today today? 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 we prepare more or less basmati rice 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:17.110
 Cantonese hello done 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:24.380
 hunger nature recovers 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:26.119
 hello hello do jump less peas 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.320
 omelette cut into thin slices 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.510
 thin but we also add the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.330
 zucchini obviously white onion like 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.400
 bottom is a bit of cooked ham 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.110
 we cut the onion even if a little 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.170
 irregular because we have to do a 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.059
 sofficino then zucchini cut into 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 julienne or thinly sliced ​​mi 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.739
 I recommend to use or place one anyway 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.660
 non-stick pan high heat this 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.300
 case said induction to 7 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.309
 let's also add some peas 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.159
 salt also add some basil that 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.519
 out now and cook 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.680
 Meanwhile, we throw rice then 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.020
 we add as usual in life 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.280
 what you eat at the Cantonese 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.930
 Chinese side that is the omelette 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.430
 cut Europe is past 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.570
 practically then we take the eggs 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.370
 we can make three eggs we beat in 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.080
 a plate then the beaten eggs I don't 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.350
 I added nothing if not a bit of 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.910
 just salt here is the pepper put some 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.130
 of pepper if you want you can add 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.510
 I don't have any aromatic herbs either 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.030
 put it because obviously the basil 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.620
 together with the zucchini peas pan 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.930
 also in this case the most thing 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.590
 important is that it is totally 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.110
 non-stick because I don't go to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.060
 put even a drop of oil 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.430
 then we heat it well and add 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.110
 beaten eggs considered a new one 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.510
 party when you have to do the proportions 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.240
 so for 4 people put in over the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.130
 as big as I used it 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.080
 very large otherwise 4 eggs which vi 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.670
 I want to show something we have 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.370
 said only eggs a pinch of salt 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.680
 pinch of pepper without oil nothing 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.539
 completely non-stick this makes it so 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.610
 which you can obviously avoid using 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.319
 totally fat when you are cold 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.280
 when you also do trivially when you say 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.510
 fried 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 in reality a bit of oil would suffice 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.720
 also in this off because totally 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.670
 also 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.920
 now we cook it here 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.650
 rice almost ready so we don't go to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 rinse under cold water 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.370
 slightly so it keeps cooking 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.780
 then let's do bits and pieces totally 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.670
 as irregular as you like 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.370
 then add the omelette 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 meanwhile the ham is lowered here 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:49.190
 the fire the rice began to unite with 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:57.290
 vegetables we also add the ham 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:59.540
 cooked ham we go to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.880
 mix everything off the fire 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.190
 because this rice is fine too 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.100
 eaten at room temperature or 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.870
 even cold even ready 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.670
 a little salt this is ours 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.670
 today's lunch a good appetite 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.450
 that's OK
