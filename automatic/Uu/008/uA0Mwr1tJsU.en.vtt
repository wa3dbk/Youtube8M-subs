00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello everyone, Nikita with you today I will give you 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:12.010
 I will show how such a mechanism from Lego 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.800
 he is very simple his probably many 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.890
 people who understand left and almost 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.289
 all the noverny know, but I made a video 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.830
 for those who do not know 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.680
 In short, it's such a thing that I now 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.470
 I will show you how it's work first 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:37.660
 what is she doing here look like this 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:41.220
 spinning and how 2 here look 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.220
 how fast is it spinning 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:57.659
 Here it is possible to twist this course 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.670
 it will take an hour and a half while you 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:05.159
 Well to make a big circle that these 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 you can even have five laps with this thing 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 even five laps do a this a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.590
 to make only one let's 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 We will understand how it all works is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.940
 such a system in general, I talked about 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 her in the review of my league excavator I 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.670
 said that my modified it well 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 here so there is one such transfer 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.119
 here let's say this and here yes 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:44.250
 such is one transmission and more and more there 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:50.160
 No, but this program is very useful if 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.259
 of course you want me to be the final 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.340
 this mechanism is spinning 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.200
 much faster than this first 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.769
 look first we take big 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.610
 dare gear 

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.940
 well we hook up with her for her little 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 on the same axis we put big with 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.500
 little sweat again 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.269
 small big and small can 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.890
 to finish 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.120
 well, that is, people like working here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.069
 let's say here it is in one turn 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 passes let's say how much I don't know 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:33.510
 20 30 years old yes how much salt spelled tooth 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 tooth teeth tooth generally there probably 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.500
 maybe twenty eight teeth 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.349
 and then when we stand next to her 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.209
 she has a smaller gear 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.430
 teeth and for now let 's say for one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.819
 big turnover she does let's say two 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.439
 turnover of their own and that is, now look like 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.300
 you twist see it already faster 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:02.780
 spinning than this axis 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.820
 we news twice probably but if 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.630
 here it will be less than six won what 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.820
 it means 2 times less means 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.880
 But the second half will be faster 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.520
 spinning then again small 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.710
 big and then at the end here is such a 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.880
 general here is such a simple mechanism 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.550
 peculiar even gearbox 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.180
 which can make great speed 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:35.690
 maybe not a little but just if 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.550
 twist then she will develop big 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.620
 speed end point with you was 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.250
 nikita subscribe to the channel put 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.250
 likes everyone until we meet again
