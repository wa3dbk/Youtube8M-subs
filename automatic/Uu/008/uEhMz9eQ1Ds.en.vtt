00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.379
 and greet everyone knows affliction 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.310
 and we end up for a new 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.320
 video that will talk about my team decerto 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 so useful competition that will soon 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.380
 open anyway we recruit in this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 moment so it's a team ps3 so for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.189
 all xbox players and well sorry 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 but it's impossible 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.739
 then the recruitment conditions 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 it's 1.50 ration ratio 4.5 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 minimum for the competition group 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.879
 explains why the group 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.679
 competition 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.909
 would there be two groups there 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.649
 will have a fun group so everyone 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.179
 will be able to play together we will make 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.050
 small dominance of these terms that his 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:56.519
 range in fun and fun on the other hand for 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.219
 the team competition is 1.50 ratio 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.789
 minimum so if you have less it's 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.109
 impossible 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.030
 there is no point in asking me 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.740
 question it will be no for the fun group 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 so all that is fun and where we 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
 will take with an index a wine of ratios 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.980
 Finally, we must not either 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 0.63 deanship damage minimum because 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.660
 even to play fun for fun 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.260
 fawkes won so you still have to 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.430
 a million rations other conditions 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.830
 16 years old minimum for both groups 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.840
 so that's finally it's by preference 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.390
 that I do not like playing with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.410
 players who have this kind 12 13 years old 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.660
 it's not that I do not get on well with 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.370
 them but usually it's taken 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.480
 head for nothing these insults and so on 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.760
 so called depending on the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.690
 mature people so for that I 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.180
 talk with them etc 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.470
 but otherwise it will be 16 years old minimum so 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.540
 for the team competition it would be necessary 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.800
 have weekend so because the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.690
 weekend because we week I have 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.270
 course so it's impossible I 'm not going 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.729
 not sleep at 2 euros morning 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.469
 Wednesday night to go to class 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 Thursday morning at 6 am press impossible a 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.580
 micro so that I think it seems to me 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.739
 logical so a microphone for the fun group 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.510
 and for the competition town this is the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.870
 lesser of things because I see 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.510
 finally his microphone is really ugly 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 then for the fun group no 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.239
 obligatory presence you come when 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.400
 you want if you want your 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.910
 invited or send a little message I 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.390
 invite you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.700
 and we all get together once the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 team will be done and I will create a 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.180
 forum so the forums 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.250
 that knows me a little because 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.030
 I already had and I have a site too 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.140
 so I created a forum for the team that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.569
 we will find more 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.310
 easily matches of steam with our 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.890
 rankings and his accounts which one has 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.480
 won the number of victories the roster 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.099
 end the roster basically it's the group 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.110
 who will play in competition and all 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.329
 nicks of the players so we were trying to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.310
 do a super clean thing super good 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.930
 that they make you really want to play in 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.060
 this island then the videos of the matches 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.069
 of tim normally should features on 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 my channel then I explain to you 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.239
 quickly because when I film with 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.069
 my avermedia i have a small shift of 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.720
 kind a second or so in the mode 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.950
 online 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.120
 so that's a bit annoying because I 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.590
 often make me feel like shit 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.650
 that's why I'm not really going 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.959
 of live so I try to find a 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.040
 way to compensate for this problem so if 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.569
 I find no less it will not be 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.180
 available unfortunately and not screaming 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.010
 we can review the private parts 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.389
 in our studios it does not appear or 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.000
 so if we can it will be really great 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.230
 but I will find a solution and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.230
 normally it should be at worst 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.579
 we will film at a friend's house 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.700
 the gameplay and that's otherwise we did not 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.200
 still name team so that's me 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.970
 count on you because find a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.299
 ultimate it's really not easy to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.940
 find 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.230
 we already have some ideas but nothing 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.970
 concrete so if you have ideas 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.310
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.840
 comments because they have an ultimate 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.609
 it's still super important knowing 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.750
 that it represents the whole group 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.329
 so you do not have to be together 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.769
 like kevin kikoo lol we do not know too much 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.790
 what it is not necessary that it is a 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.200
 disgusting number all this is a year 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.890
 really 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.760
 well neither do I know 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.100
 not what lots everything starts 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.590
 by taxing a bit loafy generally 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.419
 when you see a guy on call of who 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.600
 is called arte machin it's 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.270
 usually a calamity will be in 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.030
 butchery so already a sober name 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 accurate accurate so here I do not want to 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.520
 it is not so ugly so if 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.229
 you have ideas frankly 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.970
 do not hesitate it would make me 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.490
 really pleasure that you even compose 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.780
 if I do not really know how awesome you 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.680
 can you propose of its own 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.110
 price in the end if you have any questions 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.729
 compared to the team 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.220
 do not hesitate to drop a little 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.210
 comment or just to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.860
 add me on the psn because the psn 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.570
 well I often get a blank 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.220
 but people do not dare to invite me too much 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.630
 do not hesitate so I'm quite done 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.460
 to join them with you there is no 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.979
