00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.969
 well it 's from achilles comment for this is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 a new video and nobody wants to have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 a new way that is very cool is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 as you can see now I made a source 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 instantaneous and with game to a house of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 instant fungus tree and a prick 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.100
 a tower of archers instant and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.690
 you can do many little things you hear 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.970
 a next music background dog 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.960
 Well, there's music on and I'm 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.000
 visiting as well as is 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.449
 can when you guys basically this 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.399
 mode add a lot of things look at what 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.370
 I'm going to say that add add this sand 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.570
 to split or be you go up or go 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.840
 let's see if I have a ladder we do not have 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.989
 hip but good makes you play explained 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.519
 you can make little houses ok as you can see 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.880
 after I had to transport myself 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.979
 up but I'm not transported but good 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.810
 let's make day before we 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.880
 continue ok 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 It also makes you add these streets of 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.890
 fire these streets still fails mining 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.170
 that well also not because there I think that 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 changed the song so good before 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.030
 change these little houses good from doing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 these little things of koleston that is very 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:33.530
 very flat ps and give 222 beds two cakes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.659
 oven the crafter month 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.670
 chests are also these houses 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.110
 girls who can see how to measure it here 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.049
 1 2 3 4 from 4 and they have the same 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.690
 a big house only unlike the 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.310
 Big house returned is bigger but 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.770
 I think it's comfortable what I know 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.720
 has 4 has this has 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.240
 these two blocks wider nothing more than 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.320
 long is equal equal in the chest 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 put the wood 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.840
 of wood and things like that also does not 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 they add lanterns and the walls that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.320
 they put like this who is here for a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.510
 side but basically this is this is a 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.530
 hollow wall inside and then 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.270
 basically you add the mode too 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.670
 it adds the source is the normal street 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.410
 how are you seeing here are you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 streets fabrics add good are bits 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 three by three I think are bits of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 three that's what you add 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 the mushroom houses as they saw it at 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 principle of adding to the tower 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.160
 archers 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.030
 to see forgiveness is added and add 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.030
 A lot of things 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.629
 to the brick house that was in the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.680
 see back we did not go to see the 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.049
 let's see him the break- out house I think 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.090
 that does not tell you or if I did but did not 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.379
 agreement so well, we 're not going to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.319
 do it here pobladito or eye the house of 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.510
 brick orgasm is very cool these 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.680
 miren houses also has its two chests 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.760
 great with the full kit so 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.370
 it's shovel peak ax sword and garlic in the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.239
 young air to every five carnitas and five 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.709
 5 are right now is not very or p this mod and 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.940
 Well, basically nothing, that would be 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.049
 all mod 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.970
 the link is enough in the description 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.650
 but ojito ojito that good every for 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.110
 add the things you have to give him here 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180
 to personalized and added haiti me 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.110
 ied and I have them in a notebook that 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.760
 I will also leave you in the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.879
 description for you to see the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.099
 haiti and then what that brings them to 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.980
 a bar like this obviously does not 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.170
 gives the source another one because each idea is 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.420
 different for each thing but not good 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.549
 I'm going to leave the link of the notebook 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.220
 notes to download it is already 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.049
 all the pretty coquettish or if not then it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.000
 I can attach it to the package but not 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.530
 I think so, well, guys, hundreds of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.519

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.519
