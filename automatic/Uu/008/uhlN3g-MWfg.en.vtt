00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.960 

okay<00:00:01.949> so<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.840> jeep<00:00:03.840> grand<00:00:04.140> cherokee

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay so this is a jeep grand cherokee

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.930 
okay so this is a jeep grand cherokee
1999<00:00:05.970> model<00:00:06.440> diesel<00:00:07.670> manual<00:00:08.670> transmission

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.680 

turn<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> ignition<00:00:15.150> on

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.859 

new<00:00:20.650> chicks<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:21.970> then<00:00:22.150> start<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.539> engine<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
new chicks and then start the engine it

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.310 
new chicks and then start the engine it
takes<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.260> while<00:00:26.439> to<00:00:26.500> kick<00:00:26.830> in<00:00:28.020> pump<00:00:29.020> in<00:00:29.200> the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
takes a while to kick in pump in the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:40.520 
takes a while to kick in pump in the
acceleration<00:00:33.480> eventually<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.600> kicks<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:37.290> now

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.590 

here<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.860> Rev<00:00:42.070> it's<00:00:42.489> quite<00:00:42.730> dark<00:00:42.970> but<00:00:43.239> here

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.590 

you<00:00:46.600> can<00:00:46.750> see<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:47.019> it's<00:00:47.170> just<00:00:47.350> below<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.650> one

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you can see that it's just below the one

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600 
you can see that it's just below the one
and<00:00:49.600> then<00:00:49.750> what<00:00:49.989> happens<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.710> can<00:00:51.220> pump<00:00:51.430> it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
and then what happens I can pump it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.690 
and then what happens I can pump it
really<00:00:51.850> quickly<00:00:52.090> pump<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.780> acceleration<00:00:53.700> and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
really quickly pump the acceleration and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.180 
really quickly pump the acceleration and
it<00:00:54.820> revs<00:00:55.059> just<00:00:55.239> fine<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.989> then<00:00:59.110> if<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.530> touch

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
it revs just fine but then if I touch

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.970 
it revs just fine but then if I touch
the<00:01:00.399> acceleration<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:01.270> if<00:01:01.620> maybe<00:01:02.620> stopping

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
the acceleration as if maybe stopping

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.219 
the acceleration as if maybe stopping
the<00:01:03.219> traffic<00:01:03.399> lights<00:01:03.730> perhaps<00:01:04.089> if<00:01:04.869> I<00:01:05.020> just

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
the traffic lights perhaps if I just

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.029 
the traffic lights perhaps if I just
gently<00:01:05.530> touch<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:08.320> rises<00:01:08.590> slowly

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
gently touch it then it rises slowly

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.590 
gently touch it then it rises slowly
just<00:01:09.729> above<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.149> one<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:12.030> stays<00:01:13.030> there<00:01:13.240> now<00:01:13.570> I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
just above the one and stays there now I

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.510 
just above the one and stays there now I
can<00:01:13.960> pump<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.979> acceleration<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:17.380> much<00:01:17.649> as<00:01:17.830> as

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
can pump the acceleration as much as as

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.529 
can pump the acceleration as much as as
much<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.789> I<00:01:18.880> like<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.979> move<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.610> can<00:01:23.039> pump<00:01:24.039> it

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
much as I like I can move I can pump it

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.240 
much as I like I can move I can pump it
there<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.630> nothing<00:01:25.840> there<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.530> no<00:01:26.679> power<00:01:27.009> and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
there is nothing there is no power and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.589 
there is nothing there is no power and
it<00:01:27.399> will<00:01:27.459> stay<00:01:27.819> there<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.800> entire<00:01:29.920> time<00:01:30.399> I<00:01:31.149> can

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
it will stay there the entire time I can

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.749 
it will stay there the entire time I can
move<00:01:31.750> up<00:01:31.899> through<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.259> gears<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.369> third

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
move up through the gears up to third

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.830 
move up through the gears up to third
gear<00:01:35.550> but<00:01:36.550> always<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.149> will<00:01:37.240> drop<00:01:37.450> back<00:01:37.660> down

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
gear but always it will drop back down

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.029 
gear but always it will drop back down
to<00:01:38.229> -<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.770> same<00:01:39.009> -<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.520> same<00:01:39.700> amount<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.030> reps

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
to - the same - the same amount of reps

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.680 
to - the same - the same amount of reps
I've<00:01:42.039> taken<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.459> to<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.580> dealership<00:01:43.090> they<00:01:43.420> say

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
I've taken it to the dealership they say

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.480 
I've taken it to the dealership they say
it's<00:01:44.319> an<00:01:44.410> electrical<00:01:44.830> problem<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.340> there's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
it's an electrical problem but there's

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.650 
it's an electrical problem but there's
nothing<00:01:45.729> they<00:01:45.819> can<00:01:45.970> do<00:01:46.119> for<00:01:46.330> it

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
nothing they can do for it

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.359
