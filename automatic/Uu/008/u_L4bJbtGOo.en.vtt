00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.630
 how to be very good afternoons welcome 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.190
 to the weather forecast section and 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.810
 we had told them in the course 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.969
 from this morning that he was going to be 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.650
 registering slight instability to 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.869
 consequence of which is being reinforced 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.759
 the cold front number 26 of the season 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.500
 in the course of these next hours 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.050
 still going to be recorded wind 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.240
 of northern component and we're going to feel a 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.070
 little bit more cold at this time 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.109
 we have a temperature of 14 degrees 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.509
 centigrade has not risen much the value 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.859
 of the temperature since this morning it 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.329
 expects the minimum value in the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.050
 the course of these next hours 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.030
 reach 11 or 12 degrees centigrade 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.520
 relative humidity of 82 percent point 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.290
 of dew 11 degrees the swell until the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 moment is being recorded from 6 to 8 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.860
 feet of height therefore the port is 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.930
 finds closed to all kinds of 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.800
 navigation regardless of which 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.960
 is also being registered 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.540
 instability as a result of the system 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.670
 frontal number 28 of the season the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.830
 wind in our area registers to a 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.050
 speed of 37 kilometers per hour with 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.260
 by coming from the north and the pressure 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.299
 atmospheric is 1,025 millibars what 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.400
 they know the normal atmospheric pressure in 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.320
 our area is between 1012 and 1000 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.240
 s milibares we're still going to continue 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.340
 with a high atmospheric pressure in the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140
 course of these next hours we are going 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.610
 to see the following image on the map of 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.900
 national territory shows us 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.510
 clearly like the frontal system 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.490
 number 26 of the season remains 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.740
 extended in much of our country 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.870
 from the northwest it crosses the center and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.300
 It is also causing problems in 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.740
 much of the gulf of mexico this 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.840
 cold front is reinforced by the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.280
 frontal system number 28 that since 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.010
 yesterday we had been 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.690
 commenting was going to cause the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.570
 cold air mass that drives the system 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.700
 frontal 26 will begin to be reinforced is by 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.410
 what we are feeling a little bit more 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.030
 of cold here in our area and it 's 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.250
 condition of instability is going to 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.229
 continue to register in the course of 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.360
 these next hours remember what 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.250
 they could still be registering 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.800
 some precipitation of character 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 light and scattered as a result of 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.150
 frontal system number 28 that already comes 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.340
 going down it remains weak however 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.840
 is reinforcing the frontal system 26 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
 which is the one that is covering a large part 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.649
 of our country as you can appreciate 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.090
 towards the Yucatan Peninsula the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.010
 precipitation probability is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.260
 maintains a somewhat elevated sergio network 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.060
 and precipitations of light character and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.879
 dispersed especially in the course of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.250
 the night and in the northwestern north 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.500
 and northeast of our country in the zones 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 mountainous areas are still being recorded 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.939
 snowfall and the presence of sleet 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.860
 quite low temperatures and this 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.299
 low temperature forecast is going to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.459
 keep registering at least in the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.530
 course of these next two or three 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.230
 days while this frontal system 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.359
 number 28 keep registering and follow 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.250
 causing instability to a large extent 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.769
 of the northern portion and in the area 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.599
 border of the Mexican Republic here 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.519
 in the port of tampico still for the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.560
 today and for tomorrow in the 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.060
 course of the morning especially we go 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.010
 to be registering minimum values 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.470
 between 11 and 12 degrees Celsius 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.150
 the probability of precipitation for the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.519
 tomorrow will be 20 percent 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.620
 but we still can not rule out the 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.810
 presence of some light rains and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.819
 scattered pretty similar conditions 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.159
 to those who have been registering in 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.959
 the course of this morning here in the 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.150
 Puerto de tampico so you know 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.370
 the front system number 26 has been 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.049
 reinforced by the cold front 28 and the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.160
 instability is going to prevail so 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.500
 less today 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.570
 and tomorrow from Saturday they 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 advance in the course of the afternoon already 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.840
 we are going to be feeling a little bit more 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.490
 of heat national water commission 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.890
 So far you are forecasting a 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.590
 maximum temperature of 28 of 21 degrees 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.970
 centigrade 98 21 degrees centigrade and 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.950
 this condition is going to be 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.230
 favoring all of us here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.490
 in the littoral of the gulf of mexico this 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.050
 has been all in the first section of 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.820
 weather forecast remember that 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.380
 I come back with more information minutes 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.580
 after three in the Afternoon 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.900
 benefit for all the people who are already 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.160
 eating and I thank the gentile
