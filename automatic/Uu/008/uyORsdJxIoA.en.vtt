any<00:04:06.580> equipment<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:07.209> an<00:04:07.300> aircraft<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:08.170> three

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
any equipment on an aircraft is three

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.810 
any equipment on an aircraft is three
years<00:04:08.680> from<00:04:08.860> now<00:04:11.459> awaiting<00:04:12.459> these

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
years from now awaiting these

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.449 
years from now awaiting these
acquisitions<00:04:13.230> there<00:04:14.230> are<00:04:14.350> two<00:04:14.920> ways<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.400> we

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
acquisitions there are two ways that we

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.960 
acquisitions there are two ways that we
need<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.970> go<00:04:16.299> about<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:17.049> order<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.730> meet<00:04:18.730> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
need to go about in order to meet the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.330 
need to go about in order to meet the
security<00:04:19.120> challenges<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.080> present<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
security challenges of the present the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.730 
security challenges of the present the
first<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.390> increase<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.960> lifespan<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
first is to increase the lifespan of the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.200 
first is to increase the lifespan of the
equipment<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.700> already<00:04:25.000> available

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
equipment that is already available

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.900 
equipment that is already available
there<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.260> very<00:04:26.410> sign

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
there is a very sign

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.030 
there is a very sign
process<00:04:27.480> by<00:04:27.630> which<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.050> done<00:04:28.260> for<00:04:28.620> aircraft

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
process by which it is done for aircraft

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.830 
process by which it is done for aircraft
for<00:04:29.280> missiles<00:04:29.640> for<00:04:29.880> other<00:04:30.060> equipment<00:04:30.600> arenas

for missiles for other equipment arenas

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.710 
for missiles for other equipment arenas
etcetera<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:34.140> next<00:04:34.470> way<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:36.060> upgrade<00:04:36.570> the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
etcetera the next way is to upgrade the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.140 
etcetera the next way is to upgrade the
existing<00:04:36.750> equipment<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:38.100> upgrade<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
existing equipment to upgrade the

existing equipment to upgrade the
existing<00:04:39.180> capabilities

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
existing capabilities

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.880 
existing capabilities
now<00:04:41.460> we've<00:04:41.850> already<00:04:42.110> have<00:04:43.110> programs<00:04:43.590> which

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
now we've already have programs which

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.010 
now we've already have programs which
are<00:04:43.980> already<00:04:44.280> going<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:44.880> which<00:04:45.480> upgrade<00:04:45.840> of

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
are already going on in which upgrade of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.260 
are already going on in which upgrade of
likes<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.440> mig-29<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.340> planned<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.820> upgrade<00:04:48.120> of

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
likes a mig-29 is planned the upgrade of

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.240
