 over obstacles but not on artillery 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.129
 this video is he mechanics shooting tanks 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.250
 but the guys it's that time when 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.100
 need to tell how to throw through 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.410
 obstacles on tanks on ordinary ie 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 look we can see but which 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.100
 captures the base 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes and in line of sight we do not have it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.429
 suppose we are late but I have to go 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 far there for a long time let's say here and if 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.319
 but you know how tanks shoot 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.959
 please i look over here 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.899
 butt but I will bring here on the ground 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.910
 and my scope will be adjusted so 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.459
 way so here at this point on earth 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.289
 a projectile flew in if I aim here 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.090
 embroidered to this point of the earth to fly 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.789
 a shell over there 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 dubai i shot so over the top and u and 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.590
 there will fly a shell there is no 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.569
 Opportunities to aim at battatu 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.789
 guys I have installed commander 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.709
 the camera sometimes she doesn't need that is in 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.709
 normal mode with normal and here 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:53.009
 the camera and that's because it would be well, 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.739
 moving away yes and see here I come 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.440
 see there is a green one that is m x 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.720
 before him three hundred eighty-three meters and 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.619
 here it is there it interferes with server sights 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.369
 but three hundred and sixty three meters to bochat 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.830
 and in this mode in this position you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 you can press the right button or if 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.349
 you have changed the settings of another button 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.720
 turn on avtopritsel on this tank and here 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.490
 when you click but I'm not in the replay now 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.130
 I can have a voice tell me the goal 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.360
 captured like 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.280
 you hit then your weapon will rise so 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.490
 that the projectile will fly 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.370
 it is there for this purpose the fact is that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.610
 avtopritsel such property he does not know 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.630
 about relief, he does not take into account 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.730
 relief, that is, if there is even a very 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.040
 big in public some kind of house on y 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.340
 you are on the auto spot 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.100
 avtopritsel will hit the house in the same way 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.980
 he doesnâ€™t look at this knoll yes he 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.470
 will shoot you and batchat but the fact 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.200
 that guys not only artillery 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.480
 shells fly by arc they fly by arc 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.400
 absolutely all tanks just 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.070
 developers are stitching different 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.260
 gravity coefficients and in some tanks 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.280
 flies a flatter other almost like 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.590
 straight line 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.230
 and someone over the top so here I am 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.200
 specifically took Sherman with a gun 105 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.070
 millimeters from which they love to hit with gold 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.110
 and her shells fly so pretty 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.630
 through the top and now I 'll show you 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.910
 how it happens here we have saved 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:35.870
 the camera and now should shoot well here 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.120
 I'll look avtopritsel induced 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.650
 on the batch namely autoscope that is 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.800
 was pointed to a not howl right button 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:50.660
 clicked see how you see the projectile 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.160
 I skirted the mountain and got into the batch and now I 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.520
 take another shot 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.280
 look please here went the arc 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.660
 rounding the terrain please have a break 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.920
 demolished 336 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.920
 so now another shot 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.840
 Well, now I detached the guys 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.310
 right there in the training room 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.280
 undoed this avtopritsel and became 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.889
 aim just there for the same sight 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.030
 in the same place as it were in batch and but already 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:36.110
 by the usual yes without avtopritsel and 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.120
 please see what happened here 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.550
 there is like I said the projectile is flying 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.430
 it is in the earth that this place is not anywhere 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 jumps over nothing bends around 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.290
 use this technique it can often 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.020
 let you surprise the enemy 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.900
 I did not really think about this moment 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.300
 shooting but a man named yuri shor 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.100
 I was reminded and recommended to do about 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.100
 this video is not then another person 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.169
 behalf of Ilya Melikhov wrote well and I decided 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.040
 shoot this and thank the guys under their nicknames 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.740
 11 sledge harm 86 98 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.840
 me in the training room use 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:17.110
 this trick on the health of the guys and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.110
 good nagiba with you was 40 tons
