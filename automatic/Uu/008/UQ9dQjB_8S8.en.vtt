00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.209
 This time I show you Kanye Sato 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.679
 a tactical puzzle game from high in the Friends 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.299
 The playing field consists of 64 colored fields 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.799
 each player has 8 towers in either white or black 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.530
 starting the field 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.439
 Each player sets his towers according to the color 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.509
 on the fields 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.279
 the baseline 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.430
 is played alternately 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.760
 the black player starts 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.220
 Dr SID one of his towers arbitrarily far forward 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.490
 either diagonally 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.780
 or in a straight line 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.920
 lateral or backward movements are not allowed 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.370
 the deed falls on which his tower comes to stand 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.710
 determined at the same time in the Tom color I may move 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 be doing 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 is standing on the red field 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.870
 so that I move my red tower forward I decide for the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.870
 Diagonal and ornament on a blue field 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.310
 then my opponent pulls 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.400
 his blue tower to the front 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.640
 he lands on Leader 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 So I pull my every tower forward again 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 maximally so on until another tower blocks the way 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 skipping is not allowed 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.180
 the alternating pulling of the towers continues accordingly 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.590
 As already said 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 I have to pull in a train to pull it forward 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.130
 also allowed on each box 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.690
 only one tower stands 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.020
 be skipped 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.640
 The towers are not allowed 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700
 In this case, only the train stays with me 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 to the right 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.220
 pull one through the diagonal 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.480
 is allowed 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.580
 As the game progresses, my opponent forces me to follow the blue tower 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.200
 to pull in front 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 all possible ways 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.030
 are however 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.760
 occupied with towers of my opponent 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.760
 my tower is blocked 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.339
 I have to suspend this round 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.249
 my opponent, however, throw the tower to move 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.679
 who has the color 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.800
 as the field stands on the main blocked tower 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.959
 so here punch 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.220
 he draws with his program stood tower 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.369
 on a field the field 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:30.729
 that means 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.729
 I'm allowed to think that Love pulled Tom forward 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.939
 With that the opponent gave me the possibility 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.889
 to penetrate to its baseline 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.939
 I decide these games 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.609
 to me 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.659
 in the single-pair goal, a single point is enough to win 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.829
 this is mostly in the form of a dragon San Marco 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.829
 Communities tower to zoom Ohmacht 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 I can actively use such a solid first of the second variant in the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.869
 Standard game 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.139
 as the winner of the first round you may decide 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.289
 whether the towers are now from the left 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.709
 or repositioned from the right 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.969
 I decide that the towers should be placed from the left 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.899
 starting from the baseline 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.919
 Now all pure are processed 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.879
 my Brauner Turm is already on the left and stays there 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:25.680
 same for 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.169
 for my Green Tons on the second field 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.680
 the next tower of the series of yellow tours 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400
 also includes already placed towers 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.160
 In the second row, I no longer have towers 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 in the third row the procedure is again from left to right 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.309
 both towers 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.059
 pushed to the baseline 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.349
 the next tomb is in the fifth row 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.359
 occupies the sixth falls of the baseline 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.650
 the next do the third field and finally the winner tours 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
 the figure eight 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.529
 My opponent orders his towers according to the same rules 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.749
 in the course of the game 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.209
 the black player moves to a purple world 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.129
 now you can find my songs tower a zoom o 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.590
 move forward 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.310
 I can either do it the normal way and diagonal or straight on 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.190
 However, free fields move with a maximum increment of five 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.479
 fields 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.689
 alternative 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.860
 Can I perform a so-called bump? 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 This is always possible if an opponent is in front of me in a straight line 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.039
 and the field behind it is free 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.770
 so urgently the black player back to the yellow field 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.040
 as a reward 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.540
 that I make an extra train with my yellow tons 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.819
 I also like these sports were missing my opponent sports 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.270
 played with his ear to Swabians in the tower 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.930
 I succeed with a goal 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.840
 In order to get to the opponents Lena, I think that's another point 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.779
 on this tour is no zoom o 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.470
 I am allowed to determine again 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.939
 as the towers are set up new 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:07.850
 this time 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.770
 I decide for it 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.240
 that the towers should be sketched from right to top 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.889
 The first free space on the right will be the first goal in the first row 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:18.830
 busy 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.020
 the other towers 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.599
 join in 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.199
 the others go in from right to left 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.199
 processed 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.370
 my opponent follows the same principle 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.819
 I manage a third time on the baseline it is opponent 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.909
 I hold my third point 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.370
 three points are for the win 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.059
 necessary to play in the standard 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.059
 I could have obtained these points too early 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.659
 I would have a zoom and watches 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.759
 to draw lines on the opponents 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.069
 I get an additional dragon tooth «Marca» 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.850
 the first dragon tooth Marca is worth a point 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.029
 the second, however, already two 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.669
 Overall, this tour is a double so mo 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.270
 three points worth 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.270
 that would have been the victory in the standard game for sure 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.349
 I can bring one twice as high in the third 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.479
 variant 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.059
 in the long game 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.859
 with the double Mohr I can equal two opponents 2 billion in row behind 

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:24.999
 repress 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.999
 the back tower lands here on a brown field 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.119
 So I can do the extra train with my brown goal 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.719
 the alternative would be a normal move to a free field 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.830
 one twice as Moor 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.830
 with a maximum step further from three fields 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.750
 the long game because like me when I have a total of seven points in the form of 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.750
 Dragonfang Mark could accumulate 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.399
 The faster alternative is reaching the opponent line 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.740
 with a double that 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.690
 he will receive an additional Dragon Tooth marker worth 4 points 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.499
 such a 3x zoom is a total of seven points worth 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:07.619
 for the victory 

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:10.379
 suffice in the long game 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.039
 can be used as a 3x zoom o 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.059
 play in the longest variant in the marathon 

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:17.500
 I can go with him right away 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.310
 Of course, this goes into series 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.669
 push backwards 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.029
 this is possible with normal towers just like that 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.029
 and twice as big 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:31.699
 I move my 3x zoom clock forward one field 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.300
 and push the opponents towers 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.599
 like a field back 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.449
 alternative would be a normal movement again 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.969
 but this time only one step away from a single field 

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:48.609
 In the marathon game you have to collect a total of 15 points to win 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:50.949
 this happens again 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.689
 tame about taking in dragons 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.089
 or the fast alternative 

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:59.139
 that reach the opponent line with a 3x zoom o 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.119
 which by a fourth dragon tooth marker 

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:07.290
 is worth 15 points directly and thus 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.290
 brings the victory 

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.789
