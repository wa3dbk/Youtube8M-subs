for certain vehicles as well as certain
clothing<00:01:06.659> items<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.250> isn't<00:01:08.700> GTA<00:01:08.820> 5<00:01:09.270> right

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
clothing items so this isn't GTA 5 right

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
clothing items so this isn't GTA 5 right
now<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.409> kind<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.680> concept

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
now this is just some kind of concept

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
now this is just some kind of concept
work<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
work the it's not going to be to the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
work the it's not going to be to the
exact<00:01:14.520> same<00:01:14.729> scale<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
exact same scale as what it's going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
exact same scale as what it's going to
be<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.439> released<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.979> course

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
be like when it is released of course

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.070 
be like when it is released of course
but<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.970> similar<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.869> first

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
but this is very similar so the first

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.520 
but this is very similar so the first
thing<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.140> vehicle<00:01:22.140> wrap

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
thing that we have is the vehicle wrap

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
thing that we have is the vehicle wrap
and<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.220> looks<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.759> less<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> Louis

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and it looks more or less like a Louis

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
and it looks more or less like a Louis
Vuitton<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.110> vehicle<00:01:26.040> wrap<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.490> course<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> GTA

vehicle<00:02:44.329> wraps<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:44.870> nothing<00:02:45.260> too<00:02:45.440> different

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
vehicle wraps so nothing too different

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440

and<00:02:45.980> nothing<00:02:46.310> too<00:02:46.400> difficult<00:02:46.579> i<00:02:46.940> guess<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.269> put

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
and nothing too difficult i guess to put

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.960 
and nothing too difficult i guess to put
together<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:47.989> terms<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.530> getting<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.700> into

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
together in terms of getting this into
