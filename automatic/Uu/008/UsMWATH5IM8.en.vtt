00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.830
 so 1 hour begin slider 2 fret 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 third party then 3 frets on second 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 to the side 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.690
 and then the fifth fret oao 4 1 3 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.449
 we download on the third fret on the second 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.449
 to the side 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.890
 and then there is such a quick move hold 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:08.440
 4 watts inside pipe 2 there open and 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.440
 then open 4 countries 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 then do just want quickly 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.390
 2 from 5 string 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.810
 and twice the altar is open 4 all 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810
 act 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.470
 then we go about 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.330
 we clamp 2 frets on the first and on the second 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.930
 to the side 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.070
 in the third year we see a slide forward on 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.909
 two lanes 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.909
 then back 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200
 but 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 then also we clamp 2 frets on the third 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:06.640
 on the second side and in the second year on 3 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:13.629
 St make the exact same move for two 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.080
 fret forward then hit open 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.080
 the third 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.330
 again this move 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:36.750
 then hit open 3a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 finish 4 1 3 and 5 ok 4 that is 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.830
 combining all together 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.870
 but 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:34.819
 so the second part of the sum starts almost 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:45.650
 in the same way, only then do 3 4 on 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:47.420
 3 and 5 by 2 then we do a quick one. 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.900
 band in the regiment on 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.900
 down a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:17.040
 then 3 and 4 1 3 look and second fret on 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:26.250
 over resist 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.790
 that is , they begin and then with the band's work 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.760
 ass 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:54.750
 and then 3 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:56.669
 band then on January 14th 3 and 5 and then 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.240
 same gang fourth year on the 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.600
 to the side 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 only in that first we had slept there 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:16.890
 and then if exactly as it began 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.280
 this part and some 4 frets on the third 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.510
 to the side 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:26.330
 slightly muted and you can do 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:43.039

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:52.110
