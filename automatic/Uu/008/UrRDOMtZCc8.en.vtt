have well first things you know so
number<00:00:46.210> one<00:00:46.449> is<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.579> water-resistant<00:00:48.719> ip67

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
number one is it is water-resistant ip67

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.329 
number one is it is water-resistant ip67
which<00:00:50.019> means<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.379> can<00:00:50.440> go<00:00:50.589> about<00:00:50.710> three<00:00:51.129> feet

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
which means you can go about three feet

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.450 
which means you can go about three feet

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
resistant if it can't go 60 it has to be

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.060 
resistant if it can't go 60 it has to be
called<00:01:20.500> water<00:01:20.710> resistant<00:01:22.080> next<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.290> two<00:01:23.950> to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
called water resistant next is two to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.470 
called water resistant next is two to
three-day<00:01:24.280> battery<00:01:24.820> life<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.240> battery

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
three-day battery life so the battery

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.940 
three-day battery life so the battery
life<00:01:25.600> has<00:01:25.750> improved<00:01:25.900> from<00:01:26.290> being<00:01:26.500> an<00:01:26.620> average

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950

of one day to one to two days now two to
three<00:01:30.700> days<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:32.140> improvement<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.980> I<00:01:33.370> think

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
three days good improvement and I think

can remove the straps the other thing of

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.880 
can remove the straps the other thing of
course<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:31.330> front<00:02:31.720> camera<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.740> is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
course is the front camera so this is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.890 
course is the front camera so this is
where<00:02:33.070> its<00:02:33.220> distinguish<00:02:33.760> over<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.780> have

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
where its distinguish over here we have

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.410 
where its distinguish over here we have
a<00:02:34.930> front<00:02:35.260> camera<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:36.420> so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
a front camera over here we do not so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.070 
a front camera over here we do not so
this<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.290> gear<00:02:39.040> 2<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.420> neo

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this is the gear 2 and this is the neo

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.830 
this is the gear 2 and this is the neo
so<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.250> neo<00:02:42.460> does<00:02:42.760> not<00:02:42.910> have<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> front<00:02:43.450> camera

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
so the neo does not have a front camera

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.580 
so the neo does not have a front camera
however<00:02:44.680> they<00:02:44.890> both<00:02:45.220> do<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:46.030> an<00:02:46.360> IR<00:02:46.990> blaster

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
however they both do have an IR blaster

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
however they both do have an IR blaster
that's<00:02:48.040> because<00:02:48.340> you'll<00:02:48.490> be<00:02:48.580> able<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.850> control

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
that's because you'll be able to control

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140 
that's because you'll be able to control
your<00:02:49.660> TV<00:02:49.930> with<00:02:50.290> both<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.560> these<00:02:50.800> devices<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.030> on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
you can still take a front-facing camera

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.030 
you can still take a front-facing camera
or<00:03:15.400> rear<00:03:15.670> facing<00:03:15.910> camera<00:03:16.330> should<00:03:16.390> say<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.830> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
or rear facing camera should say and the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.370 
or rear facing camera should say and the
biggest<00:03:18.310> thing<00:03:18.580> for<00:03:19.060> number<00:03:19.900> six<00:03:20.140> is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
biggest thing for number six is

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.830 
biggest thing for number six is
definitely<00:03:20.800> this<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.220> going<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.520> have<00:03:21.700> ties<00:03:22.510> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
definitely this is going to have ties in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.380 
definitely this is going to have ties in
on<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.040> will<00:03:24.130> be<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> Tizen<00:03:24.790> OS<00:03:24.910> not

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
on it so this will be the Tizen OS not

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.449 
on it so this will be the Tizen OS not
android<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:26.860> will<00:03:26.980> no<00:03:27.070> longer<00:03:27.100> be

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
android so this will no longer be

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.540 
android so this will no longer be
Android<00:03:27.970> which<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.300> really<00:03:28.720> interesting<00:03:29.550> for

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
Android which is really interesting for

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.520 
Android which is really interesting for
the<00:03:30.640> fact<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.000> for<00:03:31.660> number<00:03:31.870> six<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.260> does

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
the fact that for number six this does

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.810 
the fact that for number six this does
have<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.770> really<00:03:33.100> interesting<00:03:33.250> twist<00:03:33.640> because

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
have a really interesting twist because

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.870 
have a really interesting twist because
the<00:03:34.630> reason<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.230> would<00:03:35.860> say<00:03:36.250> from<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.670> business

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
the reason I would say from a business

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.110 
the reason I would say from a business
standpoint<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.920> now<00:03:38.920> for<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.790> know<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
standpoint is that now for you know a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.080 
standpoint is that now for you know a
two<00:03:40.300> hundred<00:03:40.360> fifty<00:03:40.600> dollar<00:03:40.870> device<00:03:41.260> or<00:03:42.090> $150

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
two hundred fifty dollar device or $150

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
device and this is why i think the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760 
device and this is why i think the
samsung<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.180> doing<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.630> however<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.590> app

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770

samsung is doing it however the app
support<00:04:03.489> is<00:04:03.670> definitely<00:04:04.150> what's<00:04:04.360> going<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.720> be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
support is definitely what's going to be

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.860 
support is definitely what's going to be
questionable<00:04:05.410> here<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.420> remains<00:04:07.600> to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
questionable here so that it remains to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.240 
questionable here so that it remains to
be<00:04:07.900> seen<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.440> we<00:04:08.530> will<00:04:08.709> see<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.100> from

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
price point this is the one thing we do

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.890 
price point this is the one thing we do
not<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.590> yet<00:05:56.889> but<00:05:57.310> if<00:05:57.880> I<00:05:58.120> word<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:58.449> if<00:05:58.630> i<00:05:58.780> were

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
not have yet but if I word it if i were

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.290 
not have yet but if I word it if i were
to<00:05:58.990> estimate<00:05:59.409> i<00:05:59.650> would<00:05:59.889> say<00:06:00.159> that<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.759> gear<00:06:01.090> 2

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
to estimate i would say that the gear 2

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.050 
to estimate i would say that the gear 2
is<00:06:01.539> going<00:06:01.599> to<00:06:01.719> be<00:06:01.870> 2<00:06:02.199> 49<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:03.009> the<00:06:03.070> gear<00:06:03.880> neo

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
is going to be 2 49 and the gear neo

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.580 
is going to be 2 49 and the gear neo
would<00:06:04.330> be<00:06:04.479> one<00:06:04.690> friday<00:06:04.960> night<00:06:05.139> now<00:06:05.289> this<00:06:05.440> is

would be one friday night now this is

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.890 
would be one friday night now this is
just<00:06:05.620> me<00:06:05.979> estimating<00:06:06.639> and<00:06:06.759> speculating<00:06:07.419> but

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
just me estimating and speculating but

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.520 
just me estimating and speculating but
this<00:06:08.080> is<00:06:08.229> why<00:06:08.409> um<00:06:09.509> obviously<00:06:10.509> Samsung<00:06:11.199> did<00:06:11.349> get

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
this is why um obviously Samsung did get

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.920 
this is why um obviously Samsung did get
some<00:06:11.680> feedback<00:06:11.949> from<00:06:12.909> the<00:06:13.150> first<00:06:13.419> one<00:06:13.630> being

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
some feedback from the first one being

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.219 
some feedback from the first one being
that<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.349> gear<00:06:14.919> itself<00:06:15.250> was<00:06:15.520> too<00:06:15.759> expensive

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
that the gear itself was too expensive

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.290 
that the gear itself was too expensive
but<00:06:17.229> you<00:06:17.590> don't<00:06:17.889> want<00:06:18.039> to<00:06:18.099> go<00:06:18.219> too<00:06:18.280> much<00:06:18.909> lower

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
but you don't want to go too much lower

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.439 
but you don't want to go too much lower
if<00:06:20.110> your<00:06:20.289> Samsung<00:06:20.740> because<00:06:21.219> you<00:06:21.490> know<00:06:21.639> if

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449

SmartWatch<00:06:24.280> if<00:06:24.639> you're<00:06:24.820> too<00:06:25.180> much<00:06:25.360> cheaper

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
SmartWatch if you're too much cheaper

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.149 
SmartWatch if you're too much cheaper
