00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
to take a little top of this and you'll
see<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:26.970> flowy<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.380> big

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
see how flowy it really is it's very big

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
see how flowy it really is it's very big
and<00:01:28.890> flowy<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> crisscross

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and flowy and we're going to crisscross

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
and flowy and we're going to crisscross
over<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> run<00:01:33.570> across<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> other<00:01:34.259> side<00:01:34.380> over

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
over and run across the other side over

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880 
over and run across the other side over
like<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.290> took<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> really

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
like that and then I just took a really

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.280 
like that and then I just took a really
stretchy<00:01:38.460> belt<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> little

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
stretchy belt like this it's a little

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.530 
stretchy belt like this it's a little
silver<00:01:40.560> studded<00:01:40.920> belt<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.520> i<00:01:42.270> am<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
silver studded belt and i am just

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
silver studded belt and i am just
cinching<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.369> waist<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> you'll

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cinching it right at the waist so you'll

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880 
cinching it right at the waist so you'll
see<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.320> smallest<00:01:49.320> part<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
see it's at the smallest part of the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
see it's at the smallest part of the
waste<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.189> i<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.430> pinching<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> then

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
waste that i was pinching it and then

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.460 
waste that i was pinching it and then
because<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> top<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.820> flowy<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.049> pull<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
because the top is so flowy if I pull it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
because the top is so flowy if I pull it
out<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.219> over<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> top<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.149> these

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
out a little bit over the top of these

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.170 
out a little bit over the top of these
creates<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> peasant<00:01:58.560> style

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
creates the peasant style

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.610 
creates the peasant style
because<00:01:59.480> it<00:01:59.630> has<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> little<00:01:59.960> bit<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> ruffle

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
because it has a little bit of ruffle

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.470 
because it has a little bit of ruffle
and<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.220> little<00:02:01.430> bit<00:02:01.610> longer<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.150> works

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
and it is a little bit longer it works

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.600 
and it is a little bit longer it works
now<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> shorter<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.010> if<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.400> top

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
now you can do a shorter one if the top

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.790 
now you can do a shorter one if the top
is<00:02:04.640> shorter<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.360> sent<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.380> you're

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
is shorter and you sent it here you're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.080 
is shorter and you sent it here you're
just<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.250> small<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.610> little<00:02:07.940> bit

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
just going to have a small a little bit

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.639 
just going to have a small a little bit
of<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.390> bottom<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> top<00:02:09.110> sticking<00:02:09.530> out

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
of the bottom of the top sticking out

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.220 
of the bottom of the top sticking out
and<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.580> works<00:02:10.820> well<00:02:11.120> too<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.630> wouldn't<00:02:12.080> say

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and that works well too I wouldn't say

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
and that works well too I wouldn't say
go<00:02:12.380> anything<00:02:12.620> more<00:02:12.950> than<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.610> want<00:02:13.850> to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
go anything more than this you want to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.670 
go anything more than this you want to
still<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.540> able<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> tight<00:02:15.320> fitted

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
still be able to see the tight fitted

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.160 
still be able to see the tight fitted
skirt<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.220> bottom<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.450> get<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.930> file

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
skirt on the bottom so you get the file

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.860 
skirt on the bottom so you get the file
but<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.670> could<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.270> little<00:02:20.480> bit<00:02:20.600> sure

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
but you could do it a little bit sure

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.240 
but you could do it a little bit sure
that<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.440> do<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.920> peplum

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
that you want to do for that peplum

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.940 
that you want to do for that peplum
which<00:02:22.820> would<00:02:23.030> stick<00:02:23.300> out<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.720> actually<00:02:23.950> be

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
which would stick out and actually be

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.800 
which would stick out and actually be
careful<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.730> makes<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.090> back<00:02:26.300> when

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
careful because it makes the back when

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960 
careful because it makes the back when
right<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.980> would<00:02:28.100> be<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> little<00:02:28.459> bit<00:02:28.700> more

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
right here it would be a little bit more

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.210 
right here it would be a little bit more
attention<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.870> back<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:30.950> be
