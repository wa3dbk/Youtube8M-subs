00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.530
 I get up and go straight from the shower. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.839
 The first time I step in is to turn the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.289
 computer will prepare a coffee of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.810

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 adrian is this work, I keep doing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.679
 - from my friends 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.090
 it seems that we created a formula 7 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.640
 repeats these formulas without 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 Think is like you had a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.860
 recipe for how things work out 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 for your day we follow a recipe 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.950
 in life we ​​have to follow the recipe 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.500
 this is primordial 4 tablespoons of flour 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.180
 frame of the game getting half 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 way and I need everything to be 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 organized to follow the steps of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 step we met it ended juca 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 invited us to take part in the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 kitchen standards and was hit by the oea when 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 I was there, I was kind of watching Carol. 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.809
 to see if she also had a routine 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 inside the kitchen it seems that Carol 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 need to concentrate a lot when she 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.540
 is cooking very concentrated to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.900
 do because I do not know how to cook 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.610
 Truth this is a truth then so 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 if I'm there cooking dunga me 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.790
 ask me something because you said 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.159
 calls all day 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 the favor duca or now is the moment of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.540
 make a deal and I need to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 concentration even though it is very 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.450
 simple and having few ingredients voice 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.590
 I can not pass that pope's 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.590
 free pass 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.430
 is the pan to then record sometimes 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.430
 his presence there can keep quiet 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.880
 but nothing has got in the way after 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.720
 a while you do not even think more in 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.920
 recipe 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.790
 I think really only 0.0000 good 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 It is what we do rationally 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 people have to think in detail everything 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 that we do in all actions and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.950
 analyze and calculate the distance only jean 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.910
 kind of honoring the brain in two hours 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:13.400
 under the bus driver they think 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.600
 deals with those little lips in the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.990
 routine failure in which he will train 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.450
 Madrid repeats the same street and works in 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.980
 a machine in no way the routine of who 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.960
 You know the route you have to know where you have it. 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.940
 as it can stop where it can not be 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.560
 Someone wants to climb up and down 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.620
 if the buyer says something to be 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.750
 hallway mirror is it has a lot 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.700
 to think from the third day 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650
 imagine the guy is talking about football 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 with the collector there doing all the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.410
 other things automatic calm 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.660
 they tell the pictures the total brain knows the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.420
 time to enter the automatic for each 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.970
 author defends an event of the parador gave 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.700
 to me on behalf thing that happens 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.350
 does the human body have such thing has the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.040
 routine itself the recipe that it goes 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.080
 To continue completing does not 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.580
 began to stir put where together with 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.920
 that stop I do not even know she's going 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.850
 there work with the survey the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.220
 to plant potato 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.200
 maybe and asked for complete or ready 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.280
 take and even reward the result 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 Last 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.870
 To summarize, we follow the whole recipe. 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.220
 day without even realizing the first time 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.440
 we do something, it gets very 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.270
 concentrate when it starts to repeat 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.980
 Our brain catches the Saint John is 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.560
 brother's automatic geek 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.000
 but if you have something different everything changes if the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.880
 dunga enters the kitchen for example we 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.980
 in carol reserve to change or create 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.690
 a habit to analyze the revenues that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.980
 we do and try to change some 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.700
 ingredients to get a taste 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 different 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 the new habit there speaking in favor of a 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.510
 also look in the kitchen for 2 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.670
 people were campaigning together 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.280
 with the channel and Lucas and has rain 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.920
 there's still k that in one thing only then 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.140
 because it also signs the channel for 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.210
 know when you have new video and this is 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.210
 more than good
