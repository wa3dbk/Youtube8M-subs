00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.390 
you're here for days when we got these
back<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.690> character<00:02:18.140> designs<00:02:19.040> thought<00:02:19.370> I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
back so the character designs thought I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.250 
back so the character designs thought I
was<00:02:19.640> very<00:02:19.850> similar<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.570> color<00:02:20.810> palettes

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
was very similar but the color palettes

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.710 
was very similar but the color palettes
different<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:21.980> mentioned<00:02:22.510> much<00:02:23.510> less

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
different and as I mentioned much less

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
different and as I mentioned much less
lighting<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.880> was<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.300> really<00:02:26.780> fun<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
lighting but it was just really fun to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.240 
lighting but it was just really fun to
go<00:02:28.580> into<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.180> kind<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.660> mythic<00:02:30.610> history<00:02:32.380> so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.980 

about<00:02:37.250> experience<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.450> balance<00:02:38.810> between

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
about experience and the balance between

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.080 
about experience and the balance between
the<00:02:39.560> physical<00:02:39.740> world<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.310> spirit<00:02:40.670> world<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
the physical world the spirit world and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.740 
the physical world the spirit world and
so<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:41.810> see<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.020> person<00:02:42.320> who<00:02:42.530> has<00:02:42.830> been

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
so here you see a person who has been

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.949 
so here you see a person who has been
altered<00:02:44.750> by<00:02:44.870> spirits<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.660> had<00:02:47.780> it

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
altered by spirits and we just had it

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.660 
altered by spirits and we just had it
was<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.290> much<00:02:48.410> fun<00:02:48.470> designing<00:02:49.130> all<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.550> these

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670

and<00:04:17.590> stuff<00:04:17.799> but<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.070> was<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.669> was<00:04:18.820> really<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.180> big

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
and stuff but it was it was really a big

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.960 
and stuff but it was it was really a big
channel<00:04:19.659> because<00:04:20.139> in<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.220> way<00:04:21.340> we<00:04:21.370> had<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.759> pull

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
channel because in a way we had to pull

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.180 
channel because in a way we had to pull
back<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.479> all<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:22.720> stuff<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.169> we<00:04:23.259> do<00:04:23.440> try<00:04:24.159> to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
back and all the stuff that we do try to

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.939 
back and all the stuff that we do try to
make<00:04:24.310> shots<00:04:24.639> dynamic<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.590> really<00:04:26.800> had<00:04:26.919> to

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
make shots dynamic so we really had to

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.710 
make shots dynamic so we really had to
focus<00:04:27.159> a<00:04:27.490> lot<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.669> our<00:04:27.820> compositions<00:04:28.509> and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
focus a lot on our compositions and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.260 
focus a lot on our compositions and
again<00:04:28.930> like<00:04:29.349> Brian<00:04:30.130> was<00:04:30.340> saying<00:04:30.370> these<00:04:31.090> are

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
again like Brian was saying these are

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.510 
again like Brian was saying these are
the<00:04:31.740> staging<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.830> all<00:04:32.949> of<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.340> almost

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the staging of all of this is almost

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.399 
the staging of all of this is almost
based<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.120> these<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.449> old<00:04:34.690> wood<00:04:34.900> block

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
based on these like old wood block

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.249 
based on these like old wood block
prints<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:37.180> was<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.690> was<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:38.080> was<00:04:38.199> a

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
prints so it was it was it was a

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.050 
prints so it was it was it was a
challenge<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.710> was<00:04:38.800> almost<00:04:38.949> like<00:04:39.310> we<00:04:39.820> really

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
challenge it was almost like we really

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.089 
challenge it was almost like we really
had<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.210> just<00:04:40.419> focus<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:41.099> complete

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
had to just focus on complete

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.740 
had to just focus on complete
composition<00:04:42.699> and<00:04:42.849> not<00:04:42.970> really<00:04:43.240> worry<00:04:43.449> about

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
composition and not really worry about

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.409 
composition and not really worry about
oh<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.560> know<00:04:44.889> he's<00:04:45.039> gonna<00:04:45.130> start<00:04:46.060> really

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
oh you know he's gonna start really

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.770 
oh you know he's gonna start really
close<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.750> camera<00:04:47.110> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
close to camera and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.420 
close to camera and
and<00:04:47.930> then<00:04:48.080> get<00:04:48.740> away<00:04:48.889> from<00:04:48.950> camera<00:04:49.310> really

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
and then get away from camera really

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.100 
and then get away from camera really
fast<00:04:49.700> in<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.880> dynamic<00:04:50.330> way<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.690> none<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.020> that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
fast in a dynamic way that none of that

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.950 
fast in a dynamic way that none of that
stuff<00:04:51.380> really<00:04:51.500> applied<00:04:52.420> so<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:53.660> was<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.870> huge

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
stuff really applied so it was a huge

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.770 
stuff really applied so it was a huge
challenge<00:04:54.230> in<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.860> will<00:04:55.070> say<00:04:55.250> beyond<00:04:55.820> just

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
challenge in that I will say beyond just

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.659 
challenge in that I will say beyond just
working<00:04:57.200> on<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.410> show<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.620> was<00:04:57.919> when<00:04:58.520> these
