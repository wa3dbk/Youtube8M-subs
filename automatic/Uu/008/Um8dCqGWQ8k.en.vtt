00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and especially in black ops 2 recently

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.940 
and especially in black ops 2 recently
there's<00:02:40.569> been<00:02:40.629> quite<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.959> bit<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.230> guess<00:02:41.620> sort<00:02:41.860> of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
there's been quite a bit I guess sort of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.039 
there's been quite a bit I guess sort of
hackers<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:42.489> more<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.269> glitter<00:02:43.629> side

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
hackers but more on the glitter side

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.020 
hackers but more on the glitter side
where<00:02:44.739> what<00:02:45.190> they<00:02:45.340> would<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.700> they'd<00:02:45.879> go

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
where what they would do is they'd go

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.520 
where what they would do is they'd go
into<00:02:46.239> theater<00:02:46.599> mode<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> they<00:02:47.079> view<00:02:47.410> an

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
into theater mode and they view an

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.289 
into theater mode and they view an
edited<00:02:47.980> clip<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.400> somewhat<00:02:48.790> had<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.000> guess

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
edited clip that somewhat had I guess

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.900 
edited clip that somewhat had I guess
sort<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.660> tempered<00:02:50.140> with<00:02:50.319> temper<00:02:51.160> tantrum<00:02:51.700> not

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
sort of tempered with temper tantrum not

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.250 
sort of tempered with temper tantrum not
temper<00:02:52.209> tantrum<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:52.629> just<00:02:52.780> tempered<00:02:53.140> with

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
temper tantrum but just tempered with

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.650 
temper tantrum but just tempered with
and<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:54.340> would<00:02:54.459> actually<00:02:54.819> give<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.420> level

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660

prestige and then you could rewatch the

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.729 
prestige and then you could rewatch the
clip<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.450> would<00:03:04.540> set<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.989> first

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
procedure 55 you could do that again

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.900 
procedure 55 you could do that again
prestige<00:03:07.930> second<00:03:08.379> prestige<00:03:08.530> 55<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.549> overall

prestige second prestige 55 and overall

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.240 
prestige second prestige 55 and overall
basically<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.599> 9th<00:03:10.900> prestige<00:03:11.170> 55<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:11.829> guess

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
basically have 9th prestige 55 I guess

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.229 
basically have 9th prestige 55 I guess
there<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.489> something<00:03:12.760> wrong<00:03:12.879> with<00:03:12.940> being

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
there was something wrong with being

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.270 
there was something wrong with being
10th<00:03:13.450> prestige<00:03:13.799> but<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:14.920> would<00:03:15.010> set<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.250> up

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
10th prestige but it would set you up

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.159 
10th prestige but it would set you up
all<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.730> way<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.000> high<00:03:16.150> basically<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
all the way that high basically the

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.690 
all the way that high basically the
highest<00:03:17.560> or<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:17.739> least<00:03:17.889> almost<00:03:18.130> high<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.639> you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
highest or at least almost high so you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.770 
highest or at least almost high so you
can<00:03:18.849> go<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> game<00:03:19.299> without<00:03:19.419> hitting

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.229 
can go in the game without hitting

without doing anything it really affects

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.000 
without doing anything it really affects
them<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:16.930> at<00:04:16.989> least<00:04:17.139> on<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.349> inside<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.680> course

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
them or at least on the inside of course

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.409 
them or at least on the inside of course
it<00:04:18.130> doesn't<00:04:18.280> affect<00:04:18.639> them<00:04:18.729> on<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:18.940> outside<00:04:19.389> I

prestiging as much as

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.590 
prestiging as much as
possible<00:04:27.130> like<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.699> modern<00:04:27.970> warfare<00:04:28.150> 3<00:04:28.300> you

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
possible like in modern warfare 3 you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.300 
possible like in modern warfare 3 you
could<00:04:28.810> go<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.930> 20th<00:04:29.500> prestige<00:04:29.710> which

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
could go to 20th prestige which

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.040 
could go to 20th prestige which
definitely<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.850> lot<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.210> people<00:04:31.330> did<00:04:31.600> not<00:04:31.810> hit

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
definitely a lot of people did not hit

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.600 
definitely a lot of people did not hit
that<00:04:32.229> right<00:04:32.410> off<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.620> bat<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.100> know<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.520> few

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that right off the bat I know a few

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.430 
that right off the bat I know a few
people<00:04:33.820> got<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.360> 10th<00:04:34.570> prestige<00:04:34.750> pretty<00:04:35.229> fast

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
people got to 10th prestige pretty fast

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.320 
people got to 10th prestige pretty fast
and<00:04:35.650> black<00:04:35.830> ops<00:04:36.039> 2<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:36.490> my<00:04:36.550> opinion<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.300> think

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
and black ops 2 in my opinion I think

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.180 
and black ops 2 in my opinion I think
black<00:04:37.690> ops<00:04:37.900> who's<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> little<00:04:38.410> bit<00:04:38.560> easier<00:04:38.770> to

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
black ops who's a little bit easier to

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.310 
black ops who's a little bit easier to
sort<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.820> level<00:04:40.120> up<00:04:40.360> than<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.169> previous

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
sort of level up than in the previous

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.779 
sort of level up than in the previous
Call<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.770> Duty's<00:04:42.009> like<00:04:42.130> modern<00:04:42.430> warfare<00:04:42.610> 3

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
Call of Duty's like modern warfare 3

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.240 
Call of Duty's like modern warfare 3
black<00:04:43.479> ops<00:04:43.750> modern<00:04:44.110> warfare<00:04:44.259> two<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.800> some

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
black ops modern warfare two for some

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.070 
black ops modern warfare two for some
reason<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.580> found<00:04:45.789> modern<00:04:46.060> warfare<00:04:46.210> 2<00:04:46.509> really

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
reason I found modern warfare 2 really

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.689 
reason I found modern warfare 2 really
really<00:04:47.500> hard<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.889> level<00:04:48.130> up<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.400> maybe<00:04:48.520> just

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
really hard to level up and maybe just

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.040 
really hard to level up and maybe just
because<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:48.940> wasn't<00:04:49.240> too<00:04:49.600> good<00:04:49.750> at<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:49.990> game

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
because I wasn't too good at that game

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.450 
because I wasn't too good at that game
because<00:04:50.259> I<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:50.560> about<00:04:50.740> two<00:04:50.889> years<00:04:50.919> ago<00:04:51.190> when<00:04:51.430> I

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
because I was about two years ago when I

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.279 
because I was about two years ago when I
played<00:04:51.699> that<00:04:51.729> pretty<00:04:52.060> avidly<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.990> hope<00:04:53.169> you

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289
