 just say we pack them together 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.820
 So the packaging looks like it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 nice and well packaged and there we have 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.719
 a few more features what the whole 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 So here we can have it here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.110
 Let's say we pack and I start 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:56.059
 time down here 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:56.059
 there is a sticker once the change 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:09.479
 here 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:11.369
 Ok, so it looks like more is not there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 are so to speak but here is already 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 I have some things here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 This happy end is a high quality thing 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 you can see it too you can do it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.259
 relatively far against those are loud 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.150
 manufacturer really unbeatable so you 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.810
 that can really bend completely there 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.720
 happened really nothing nice came 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 herres logo here on the inside only 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.950
 on the left side here again 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 appearances for right and left and above 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.750
 we have this nice from lena that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.850
 republic logo feels nice and soft 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.420
 and underneath me a little 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 suede or velvet-like lena feels 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 Overall, very nice 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 also soft padded overall beautiful 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.490
 quality 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.159
 what do we have here yet and indeed 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 here are the speakers we take 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:04.990
 let's get out of the question how is that okay 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 is that just pull out times 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.810
 and we see the two are here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.069
 interchangeable as if one broke 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 go or something you know again 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.349
 individually to buy and this plate 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.989
 here with the as well as public logo the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.810
 is made of brushed aluminum resp 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.330
 metal feels beautiful high quality 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.410
 also nice and cool now where the straight 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.630
 fresh delivered 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.040
 here comes the link cable 1 here comes 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.780
 the right winery that's her name 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.090
 You can also replace the cables 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 And if the cable breaks, it's easy 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.880
 another cable in and that's it 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.880
 as soon as here it would be if its 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:53.200
 and then the headphones are so to speak 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:56.260
 finished exactly and so you know that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.580
 also optimally on your head and on 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 set your ears 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.340
 and yes the inside here is good 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.620
 fed feels very very nice 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.290
 soft on nice leather here or 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.609
 artificial leather depending on the really very 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.630
 very soft and feels very much 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.640
 high quality 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.150
 otherwise what else do I have here in the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:25.420
 packaging we probably have here 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.310
 a few cables exactly that is not 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.540
 that is to say it can 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.609
 Now let's look more closely 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.609
 what a cable is 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.620
 and we have an adapter here 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.330
 two and a half millimeters on the big one 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 plug and then we have the here 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.870
 small plugs that come in each case 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.240
 The headphones Rhein are two and a half 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.390
 millimeter plug and that will come 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.580
 here in the smartphone or whatever 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.070
 what you have music that comes because 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.420
 we have an ipod or iphone here 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.890
 volume control that works too 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.510
 you will not go far with that android 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.760
 Of course you can come here with us 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.530
 the big button on pause and play 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.090
 check in and we should also enter here 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.550
 I have installed the microphone 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.750
 can also make phone calls 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.040
 okay, what else do we have here in the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020
 packaging and I think that was still 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.440
 not everything 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.870
 yes have a cable here and that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 the really thick studio cable that still 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.440
 times thicker and here you can the adapter 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.560
 unscrew it again in ordinary 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.630
 the smartphone stuck if you do because 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.490
 volt and there you can then the adapter 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.710
 it does not happen again 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.500
 At the moment I need a cool one 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.540
 Idea in any case and I like it completely 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.350
 good and then screw it back on 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.030
 So would use amplifier or something 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.500
 it's just thought the cable is 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.390
 really very stable and as thick as her 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.920
 it can also be seen 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.930
 which are two meters long or something 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.420
 really nice quality cable 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.190
 so that you are listening to music 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.610
 can produce for that are the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.910
 yes thought and we have a few 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.290
 leigh fletcher from the coast of calvin 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.580
 harrison sticker and a bag there 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.950
 can you come in the headphones and 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.680
 yes it is now nicely lined from the inside 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.150
 a bit of rain and water from the outside 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.980
 fall off looks pretty good 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.940
 and definitely one of the tg sowas 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.860
