side mark of the light bulb there it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.099 
side mark of the light bulb there it
goes<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> side<00:00:55.379> marker<00:00:55.770> out

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.029 

light<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> light<00:01:01.559> bulb

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
light up the light bulb

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.719 
light up the light bulb
now<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.280> take<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.580> latch<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:07.729> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
now we need to take this latch out it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
now we need to take this latch out it's
going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:08.970> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> hard<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.689> off<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
going to be kind of hard to take off I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
going to be kind of hard to take off I
mean<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.439> necessarily<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.250> hard<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
mean not necessarily very hard but you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
mean not necessarily very hard but you
will<00:01:12.930> need<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:14.270> screwdriver<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:16.610> something

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
will need a screwdriver or something

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
will need a screwdriver or something
small<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.909> underneath<00:01:21.740> right

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
small that you can get underneath right

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.520 
small that you can get underneath right
here<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:24.270> probably<00:01:24.540> need<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> pry<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.049> play

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
here you probably need to pry it play

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
here you probably need to pry it play
around<00:01:25.799> from<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.150> sides<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> then

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
around from here and the sides and then

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
around from here and the sides and then
pull<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:29.390> because<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.920> holds<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pull it up because it holds on to the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
pull it up because it holds on to the
sides<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sides right here as you can see so this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
sides right here as you can see so this
is<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:39.259> I'm<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.290> going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is what I'm going to do I'm just going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.639 
is what I'm going to do I'm just going
to<00:01:40.680> pry<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> sides<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> go

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
to pry it from the sides and there we go

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.899 
to pry it from the sides and there we go
we<00:01:49.649> got<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.009> office<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:52.850> now<00:01:53.850> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
we got this office right here now you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
we got this office right here now you
just<00:01:54.390> gently<00:01:58.159> pull<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.189> out<00:02:00.320> there<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
just gently pull it out there we go

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.930 
just gently pull it out there we go

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
you got the light bulb

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.910 
you got the light bulb
here<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.050> is<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.990> lightbulb<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.440> already<00:02:08.770> in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
here it is the lightbulb is already in

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.600 
here it is the lightbulb is already in
there<00:02:09.960> what<00:02:10.960> we<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.350> do<00:02:11.560> what<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.460> is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
there what we can do what I can do is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.040 
there what we can do what I can do is
just<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.900> option<00:02:14.320> one<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:16.050> place

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just with option one you can just place

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.150 
just with option one you can just place
it<00:02:17.230> back<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:19.270> top<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.980> can

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
it back in and on top of that you can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.490 
it back in and on top of that you can
take<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.610> metal<00:02:22.470> at<00:02:23.470> latch<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:25.090> place<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:26.470> top

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
take the metal at latch in place on top

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.580 
take the metal at latch in place on top
but<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.450> easier<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.080> me<00:02:29.230> for

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
but what I think is easier for me for

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.650 
but what I think is easier for me for
myself<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.720> would<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.930> less<00:02:32.110> work<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:33.660> I'm

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
myself and it would be less work is I'm

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.720 
myself and it would be less work is I'm
going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.840> take<00:02:34.930> out<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> light<00:02:35.380> bulb<00:02:35.730> then

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
going to take out the light bulb then

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.720 
going to take out the light bulb then
I'm<00:02:36.850> going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.060> place<00:02:38.070> place<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:41.460> back<00:02:42.460> in

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
I'm going to place place it in back in

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.090 
I'm going to place place it in back in
there<00:02:42.940> without<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.290> side<00:02:44.500> marker<00:02:47.100> alright

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
there without the side marker alright

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
there without the side marker alright
it's<00:02:48.460> in<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:50.310> take<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.460> latch<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.970> it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's in then take the latch and put it

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.210 
it's in then take the latch and put it
on<00:02:55.420> top<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:59.200> way<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.710> be<00:02:59.770> easier

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
on top that way it's going to be easier

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.950 
on top that way it's going to be easier
to<00:03:00.460> put<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.450> latch<00:03:01.600> on<00:03:02.140> top<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.390> got<00:03:04.540> more

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
to put the latch on top and you got more

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.270 
to put the latch on top and you got more
room<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.200> play<00:03:05.530> around<00:03:05.770> with<00:03:06.010> all<00:03:10.350> right<00:03:11.350> there

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
room to play around with all right there

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.000 
room to play around with all right there
we<00:03:12.400> go<00:03:12.550> with<00:03:13.450> one<00:03:13.690> side<00:03:13.930> in
