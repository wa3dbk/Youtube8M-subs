00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
and I really am liking it but I realized

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.640 
and I really am liking it but I realized
it<00:02:13.480> actually<00:02:13.780> wasn't<00:02:13.959> really<00:02:14.200> what<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.350> wanted

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
because as much as it was a nice light

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.320 
because as much as it was a nice light
color<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.930> wasn't<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> matte<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.430> I'm<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.880> picked
