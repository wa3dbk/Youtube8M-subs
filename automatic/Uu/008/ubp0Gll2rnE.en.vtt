onions a few garlic that I could take
out<00:00:38.269> it<00:00:38.420> would<00:00:38.510> make<00:00:38.629> for<00:00:38.659> a<00:00:38.839> really<00:00:38.989> nice

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
out it would make for a really nice

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.229 
out it would make for a really nice
clean<00:00:39.589> bed<00:00:39.890> but<00:00:40.339> I'd<00:00:40.489> rather<00:00:40.670> leave<00:00:40.940> them<00:00:41.089> in

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
clean bed but I'd rather leave them in

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.750 
clean bed but I'd rather leave them in
there<00:00:41.420> because<00:00:41.600> then<00:00:42.019> I<00:00:42.050> have<00:00:42.550> just<00:00:43.550> more

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
there because then I have just more

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.399 
there because then I have just more
biodiversity<00:00:44.149> in<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.690> garden<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:48.019> next

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
biodiversity in the garden the next

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.989 
biodiversity in the garden the next
important<00:00:48.829> step<00:00:48.859> here<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.339> to<00:00:49.370> take<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.789> hard

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
important step here is to take the hard

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.719 
important step here is to take the hard
rake<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.649> level<00:00:51.649> everything<00:00:52.129> out<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.399> the

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
rake and level everything out and the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.950 
rake and level everything out and the
cool<00:00:52.909> thing<00:00:52.940> about<00:00:53.149> doing<00:00:53.389> that<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.659> when<00:00:53.870> you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
cool thing about doing that is when you

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.629 
cool thing about doing that is when you
do<00:00:54.139> it<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:54.679> almost<00:00:54.889> like<00:00:55.039> you're<00:00:55.190> tailing<00:00:55.429> to

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
do it it's almost like you're tailing to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:56.979 
do it it's almost like you're tailing to
half<00:00:55.819> an<00:00:55.999> inch<00:00:56.149> because<00:00:56.479> you're<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.749> kind<00:00:56.929> of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
half an inch because you're just kind of

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.660 
half an inch because you're just kind of
lightly<00:00:57.559> using<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.039> rake<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.429> makes<00:00:58.579> a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
lightly using the rake and it makes a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.369 
lightly using the rake and it makes a
really<00:00:58.819> nice<00:00:59.059> place<00:00:59.359> to<00:00:59.600> put<00:00:59.749> your<00:00:59.870> seeds<00:01:00.139> into

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
really nice place to put your seeds into

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.959 
really nice place to put your seeds into
so<00:01:00.679> that's<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:00.949> I'm<00:01:01.039> gonna<00:01:01.129> do<00:01:01.339> now<00:01:01.519> making

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
so that's what I'm gonna do now making

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.369 
so that's what I'm gonna do now making
everything<00:01:02.149> nice<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:02.629> level<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.959> mulch<00:01:03.199> is

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
on now and you can see I actually put a

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.820 
on now and you can see I actually put a
reasonably<00:01:05.690> thick<00:01:05.960> layer<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.260> just<00:01:06.650> have<00:01:06.740> to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
make sure wherever I put seeds that I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.730 
make sure wherever I put seeds that I
don't<00:01:08.450> have<00:01:08.540> too<00:01:08.750> thick<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.140> layer<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.500> straw

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
don't have too thick of a layer of straw

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.560 
don't have too thick of a layer of straw
another<00:01:10.580> thing<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.850> was<00:01:10.940> gonna<00:01:11.060> mention<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.510> I

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
another thing I was gonna mention is I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.320 
another thing I was gonna mention is I
like<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.810> water<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.010> garden<00:01:13.190> before<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:13.880> plant

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
like to water the garden before I plant

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.880 
like to water the garden before I plant
not<00:01:14.660> right<00:01:15.020> before<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:15.590> don't<00:01:15.740> want

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
not right before because you don't want

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.590 
not right before because you don't want
to<00:01:15.950> be<00:01:16.040> working<00:01:16.160> in<00:01:16.370> really<00:01:16.610> mucky<00:01:16.940> soil<00:01:17.180> but

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
to be working in really mucky soil but

like an hour before or the night before

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.710 
like an hour before or the night before
it<00:01:19.430> really<00:01:19.550> makes<00:01:19.820> planting<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.270> lot<00:01:20.360> easier

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
all gonna be alive and to prepare the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.310 
all gonna be alive and to prepare the
planting<00:01:59.480> hole<00:01:59.510> here<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.020> could<00:02:00.170> use<00:02:00.200> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
planting hole here you could use a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.110 
planting hole here you could use a
little<00:02:00.530> trowel<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:01.430> thing<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.700> often<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.090> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
little trowel one thing I often like to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.360 
little trowel one thing I often like to
use<00:02:02.330> as<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.540> fork<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.590> just<00:02:03.770> kind<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.070> dig<00:02:04.250> up

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
use as a fork and I just kind of dig up

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.949 
use as a fork and I just kind of dig up
the<00:02:04.520> whole<00:02:04.670> soil<00:02:05.800> not<00:02:06.800> too<00:02:07.100> deep<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:07.550> just

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
the whole soil not too deep but just

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.020 
the whole soil not too deep but just
deep<00:02:08.959> enough<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.319> loosen<00:02:09.679> everything<00:02:10.030> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
deep enough to loosen everything and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.259 
deep enough to loosen everything and
that<00:02:11.930> gives<00:02:12.139> a<00:02:12.260> nice<00:02:12.849> planting<00:02:13.849> bed<00:02:13.999> and<00:02:14.209> it

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
that gives a nice planting bed and it

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.429 
that gives a nice planting bed and it
makes<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> really<00:02:14.629> easy<00:02:14.719> for<00:02:14.930> me<00:02:15.109> to<00:02:15.139> plant

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
makes it really easy for me to plant

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.140 
makes it really easy for me to plant
with<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.799> my<00:02:15.920> hands<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.519> always<00:02:16.909> want<00:02:17.120> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
with just my hands you always want to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.710 
with just my hands you always want to
remove<00:02:17.389> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
remove the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.910 
remove the
when<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.050> plant<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.440> think<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:18.740> pretty

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
when you plant I think that's pretty

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.620 
when you plant I think that's pretty
obvious<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.550> plastic<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.150> even<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.510> have

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
obvious for plastic but even if you have

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.020 
obvious for plastic but even if you have
any<00:02:20.780> kind<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.050> burlap<00:02:21.560> or<00:02:21.950> fiber<00:02:22.310> pod<00:02:22.640> or<00:02:22.850> even

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
any kind of burlap or fiber pod or even

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.270 
any kind of burlap or fiber pod or even
like<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.260> biodegradable<00:02:24.260> pot<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:24.950> they<00:02:25.130> might

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
like a biodegradable pot as they might

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.890 
like a biodegradable pot as they might
call<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.910> always<00:02:26.090> want<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.420> remove<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
call it you always want to remove it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.420 
call it you always want to remove it
because<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.650> really<00:02:27.830> doesn't<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.340> in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
because it really doesn't want to be in

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.010 
because it really doesn't want to be in
there<00:02:28.580> with<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.790> plant<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.510> spray<00:02:29.810> them

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
there with the plant they spray them

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.380 
there with the plant they spray them
with<00:02:30.230> effective<00:02:31.160> microorganisms<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.090> kelp

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
with effective microorganisms and kelp

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.730 
with effective microorganisms and kelp
sea<00:02:32.810> minerals<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.380> these<00:02:33.530> kind<00:02:33.710> of

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
sea minerals all these kind of

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.410 
sea minerals all these kind of
biostimulants<00:02:34.400> I've<00:02:34.490> talked<00:02:34.700> about<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
biostimulants I've talked about on the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.410 
biostimulants I've talked about on the
root<00:02:35.570> ball<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:37.340> spray<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> leaves<00:02:37.730> too<00:02:38.030> and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
root ball get spray the leaves too and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.670 
root ball get spray the leaves too and
while<00:02:38.570> I'm<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.080> take<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:39.440> bit<00:02:39.560> of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
while I'm at it I take a little bit of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.190 
while I'm at it I take a little bit of
my<00:02:39.830> mycorrhizal<00:02:40.580> fungal<00:02:41.120> powder<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:42.050> rub

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
my mycorrhizal fungal powder I just rub

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.540 
my mycorrhizal fungal powder I just rub
that<00:02:42.350> onto<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.740> roots<00:02:42.950> doesn't<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.430> go

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
that onto the roots doesn't have to go

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.400 
that onto the roots doesn't have to go
everywhere<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.180> plant<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.630> now<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.290> just

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
everywhere to plant it now I can just

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.320 
everywhere to plant it now I can just
dig<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.800> my<00:02:45.950> hands<00:02:46.190> basically<00:02:46.520> kind<00:02:47.300> of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
dig with my hands basically kind of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.860 
dig with my hands basically kind of
remove<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.780> clumps<00:02:49.210> put<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.300> down<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.660> there

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
remove the clumps put it down in there

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.030 
remove the clumps put it down in there
and<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.290> something<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.950> just

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
and with something like this you just

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.650 
and with something like this you just
want<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.370> top<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.210> be<00:02:53.300> level<00:02:53.570> with

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
want the top of this to be level with

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.990 
want the top of this to be level with
the<00:02:53.780> top<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.200> your<00:02:54.320> soil<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.850> want

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
the top of your soil and then you want

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.430 
the top of your soil and then you want
to<00:02:56.060> fill<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.360> back<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.930> same<00:02:57.200> soil

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
to fill it back in with the same soil

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.170 
to fill it back in with the same soil
that's<00:02:57.680> already<00:02:57.860> there<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.700> doesn't<00:02:58.850> look

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
that's already there it doesn't look

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.730 
that's already there it doesn't look
like<00:02:59.210> that<00:02:59.420> exciting<00:02:59.960> of<00:03:00.080> soil<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.500> know<00:03:00.590> I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
like that exciting of soil but I know I

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.290 
like that exciting of soil but I know I
amended<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.280> with<00:03:01.400> compost<00:03:01.760> about<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> month

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
amended it with compost about a month

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.980 
amended it with compost about a month
ago<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.720> know<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.730> good<00:03:04.880> shape

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
ago so I know that it's in good shape

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.630 
ago so I know that it's in good shape
and<00:03:05.990> same<00:03:06.560> with<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.770> fertilizers<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.370> put<00:03:07.550> in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and same with the fertilizers I put in

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.540 
and same with the fertilizers I put in
there<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.300> want<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.570> press<00:03:08.990> it<00:03:09.140> down<00:03:09.550> not

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
there I really want to press it down not

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.130 
there I really want to press it down not
that<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.940> compact<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> soil<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.020> it

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
that I want to compact the soil but it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.480 
that I want to compact the soil but it
needs<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.560> good<00:03:12.590> soil<00:03:12.980> around<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.370> I'm

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
needs to have good soil around it I'm

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.970 
needs to have good soil around it I'm
gonna<00:03:13.670> plant<00:03:13.910> for<00:03:14.240> corns<00:03:14.720> per<00:03:14.960> hole<00:03:15.200> about<00:03:15.650> six

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
gonna plant for corns per hole about six

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.980 
gonna plant for corns per hole about six
inches<00:03:16.250> apart<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.180> diamond<00:03:17.630> shape<00:03:17.840> and

inches apart just in a diamond shape and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.590 
inches apart just in a diamond shape and
that's<00:03:18.830> one<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.430> ways<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.360> tree

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
that's one of the ways that the tree

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.880 
that's one of the ways that the tree
sisters<00:03:20.960> are<00:03:21.080> put<00:03:21.260> together<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.680> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
sisters are put together like that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.440 
sisters are put together like that
gently<00:03:22.430> very<00:03:22.970> gently<00:03:23.560> kind<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:25.090> squeeze<00:03:26.090> on

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
gently very gently kind of squeeze on

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.900 
gently very gently kind of squeeze on
the<00:03:27.380> bottom<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.830> container<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.370> push<00:03:28.640> the

the bottom of the container and push the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.560 
the bottom of the container and push the
plant<00:03:29.120> out<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:31.580> try<00:03:31.820> not<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.090> pull<00:03:32.300> on<00:03:32.330> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
plant out and you try not to pull on the

plant out and you try not to pull on the
stem<00:03:32.840> other<00:03:33.140> than<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.500> guiding<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.070> with<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
stem other than just guiding it with the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.160 
stem other than just guiding it with the
stem<00:03:36.220> especially<00:03:37.220> today<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.489> have<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.820> be<00:03:38.170> very

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
stem especially today I have to be very

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.970 
stem especially today I have to be very
careful<00:03:39.650> yay<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:42.080> we<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> plant<00:03:42.650> here<00:03:42.860> now

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
careful yay so we have a plant here now

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.530 
careful yay so we have a plant here now
this<00:03:43.100> was<00:03:43.250> one<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.610> taller<00:03:43.820> ones<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.360> it's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
this was one of the taller ones so it's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.760 
this was one of the taller ones so it's
probably<00:03:45.050> going<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> better<00:03:45.560> root

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
probably going to have a better root

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.740 
probably going to have a better root
system<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:46.310> at<00:03:46.670> least<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:47.060> came<00:03:47.300> out<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.570> one

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
system but at least that came out in one

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.310 
system but at least that came out in one
piece

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
piece

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.560 
piece
I<00:03:48.350> don't<00:03:48.769> need<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.980> spray<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.489> any<00:03:49.670> of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
I don't need to spray this with any of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.750 
I don't need to spray this with any of
my<00:03:50.959> liquid<00:03:51.320> or<00:03:51.620> mycorrhizal<00:03:52.010> fungi<00:03:52.430> because<00:03:52.700> I

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
my liquid or mycorrhizal fungi because I

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.190 
my liquid or mycorrhizal fungi because I
did<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.239> seeded<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.900> I've<00:03:54.019> been

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
did that when I seeded and I've been

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.840 
did that when I seeded and I've been
watering<00:03:54.560> with<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.040> liquid

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
watering with the liquid

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.759 
watering with the liquid
throughout<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.570> week<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.230> it's<00:03:57.410> all<00:03:57.500> ready<00:03:57.680> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
throughout the week so it's all ready to

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:06.050 
throughout the week so it's all ready to
go

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.380 

one<00:04:06.690> corn<00:04:07.020> down<00:04:07.290> 47<00:04:08.069> more<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:08.910> we're<00:04:09.180> on

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
one corn down 47 more to go now we're on

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.660 
one corn down 47 more to go now we're on
to<00:04:09.630> sowing<00:04:10.230> seeds<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.040> first<00:04:11.280> thing<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.610> do

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
to sowing seeds and the first thing I do

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.820 
to sowing seeds and the first thing I do
before<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:12.240> sow<00:04:12.569> seeds<00:04:12.930> as<00:04:13.140> I've<00:04:13.290> said<00:04:13.470> before

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
before I sow seeds as I've said before

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.250 
before I sow seeds as I've said before
is<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.490> soak<00:04:14.819> them<00:04:15.120> first<00:04:15.360> for<00:04:15.720> about<00:04:15.870> six<00:04:16.200> to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
is I soak them first for about six to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.710 
is I soak them first for about six to
twelve<00:04:16.590> hours<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:18.000> could<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.480> water

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
twelve hours in it could be just water

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.900 
twelve hours in it could be just water
but<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.290> usually<00:04:19.500> include<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.250> liquid<00:04:20.639> kelp

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
but I usually include some liquid kelp

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.140 
but I usually include some liquid kelp
and<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.870> some<00:04:22.650> liquid<00:04:22.950> sea<00:04:23.520> minerals<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
and or some liquid sea minerals and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.520 
and or some liquid sea minerals and
that's<00:04:24.450> gonna<00:04:24.570> give<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.990> seeds<00:04:25.230> some

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
that's gonna give the seeds some

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.860 
that's gonna give the seeds some
minerals<00:04:25.980> for<00:04:26.310> when<00:04:26.430> they<00:04:26.550> sprout<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.600> know

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
minerals for when they sprout you know

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.030 
minerals for when they sprout you know
so<00:04:28.080> they<00:04:28.200> have<00:04:28.320> all<00:04:28.410> these<00:04:28.530> trace<00:04:28.800> minerals

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so they have all these trace minerals

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800 
so they have all these trace minerals
they<00:04:29.310> need<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.970> kelp<00:04:30.210> gives<00:04:30.480> them<00:04:30.630> some

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
they need and the kelp gives them some

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.330 
they need and the kelp gives them some
natural<00:04:31.260> plant<00:04:31.500> growth<00:04:31.740> hormones<00:04:32.190> that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
well if they have their nitrogen fixing

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.340 
well if they have their nitrogen fixing
inoculant<00:04:47.850> on<00:04:48.000> them<00:04:48.240> there<00:04:48.600> may<00:04:48.870> be<00:04:48.900> some<00:04:49.260> of

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
inoculant on them there may be some of

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.840 
inoculant on them there may be some of
those<00:04:49.440> bacteria<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.160> soil<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:50.580> there<00:04:50.730> may

those bacteria in the soil but there may

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.850 
those bacteria in the soil but there may
not<00:04:51.060> be<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.780> if<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:52.080> take<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.320> little<00:04:52.590> bit<00:04:52.800> of

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
put on all the seeds is my mycorrhizal

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.020 
put on all the seeds is my mycorrhizal
inoculant<00:05:01.290> which<00:05:02.160> again<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.550> in<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.820> powder

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.719 
inoculant which again is in a powder
form<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.600> just<00:05:03.810> sprinkle<00:05:04.200> it<00:05:04.260> on<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.710> can<00:05:05.610> put

and now these are unoccupied a plant my

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.250 
and now these are unoccupied a plant my
seed<00:05:15.919> place<00:05:16.919> it<00:05:17.130> down<00:05:17.340> in<00:05:18.180> there<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:19.080> just

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
seed place it down in there and just

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.990 
seed place it down in there and just
cover<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.590> up<00:05:19.710> with<00:05:19.770> nice<00:05:20.070> powdery<00:05:20.550> soil<00:05:20.820> so
