00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
having to get to know each other from

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.710 
having to get to know each other from
nothing<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.619> bet<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.790> few<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
nothing I bet very few of them would be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.270 
nothing I bet very few of them would be
coming<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> same<00:01:28.500> towns<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> I've

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
coming from the same towns and I've

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
coming from the same towns and I've
already<00:01:29.520> known<00:01:29.790> each<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.420> pet<00:01:30.600> that's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
already known each other at a pet that's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530 
already known each other at a pet that's
probably<00:01:31.200> kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.590> rare<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.640> being<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
probably kind of rare so being in a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
probably kind of rare so being in a
house<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.079> good<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.619> camaraderie<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.520> for
