this time it'll be a dot rar file so
you'll<00:02:41.750> need<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:43.160> windows<00:02:43.990> RAR<00:02:44.990> download

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you'll need to have windows RAR download

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949 
you'll need to have windows RAR download
on<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.370> computer<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:47.150> order<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.570> extract

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
on your computer in order to extract

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.970 
on your computer in order to extract
this<00:02:48.520> but<00:02:49.520> once<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.560> then<00:02:51.560> just

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
this but once you have that then just

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.610

and the finished file will look like

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.350 
and the finished file will look like
this<00:02:57.980> once<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:58.580> done<00:02:58.730> extracting<00:03:00.850> then<00:03:01.850> need

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
this once it's done extracting then need

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.800 
this once it's done extracting then need
to<00:03:02.390> open<00:03:02.989> up<00:03:03.080> iTunes<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:05.060> make<00:03:05.390> sure<00:03:05.420> your

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
ipod is connected at this point

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.270 
ipod is connected at this point
go<00:03:09.740> into<00:03:10.190> your<00:03:10.340> ipod
