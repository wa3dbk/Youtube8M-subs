hey everybody this is Brett and today
I'm<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> teach<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.160> can

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
I'm going to teach you how you can

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.919 
I'm going to teach you how you can
increase<00:00:06.120> your<00:00:06.240> iron<00:00:06.839> absorption<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
increase your iron absorption and

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
increase your iron absorption and
recently<00:00:09.929> I've<00:00:10.139> been<00:00:10.380> studying<00:00:10.800> articles<00:00:11.670> on

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
recently I've been studying articles on

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.970 
recently I've been studying articles on
the<00:00:12.030> Internet<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> couple<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the Internet and I had a couple of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.349 
the Internet and I had a couple of
nutritional<00:00:14.839> analysis<00:00:15.839> done<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:16.710> blood

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
nutritional analysis done on my blood

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.970 
nutritional analysis done on my blood
for<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> iron<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.439> came<00:00:20.250> out<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> level<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.980> 96

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
for the iron I came out at a level of 96

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.269 
for the iron I came out at a level of 96
and<00:00:24.650> acceptable<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:26.130> between<00:00:26.960> 45<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.279> 170

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and acceptable was between 45 and 170

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.260 
and acceptable was between 45 and 170
and<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and so that was okay but it was on the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.290 
and so that was okay but it was on the
lower<00:00:33.510> end<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.760> know<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.120> could

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
lower end of that and you know it could

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.490 
lower end of that and you know it could
definitely<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:37.050> better<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.790> also<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
definitely be better and also just to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.630 
definitely be better and also just to
throw<00:00:40.739> something<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:43.399> fairly<00:00:44.399> low

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
throw something in I was also fairly low

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080 
throw something in I was also fairly low
kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> middle<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:46.110> zinc

kind of right in the middle with zinc

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
kind of right in the middle with zinc
you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> black<00:00:48.750> dot<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you can see the black dot there in the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.049 
you can see the black dot there in the
center<00:00:50.100> shows<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.879> where<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> came<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
center shows that where I came out in

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
center shows that where I came out in

zinc as far as vegetable quality foods
are<00:01:07.470> concerned<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.250> found<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.240> beans<00:01:09.720> legumes

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
are concerned are found in beans legumes

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.539 
are concerned are found in beans legumes
and<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> learned<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.409> long<00:01:13.770> time<00:01:13.830> ago

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and you know I learned a long time ago

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.719 
and you know I learned a long time ago
when<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> first<00:01:15.930> started<00:01:16.350> studying

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
when I first started studying

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.730 
when I first started studying
macrobiotics<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> need<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.900> soak<00:01:19.350> your

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
macrobiotics that you need to soak your

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
macrobiotics that you need to soak your
beans<00:01:20.780> and/or<00:01:21.780> grains<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:24.090> what

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
beans and/or grains and so that what

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
beans and/or grains and so that what
that<00:01:24.360> does<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.290> there's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.100> substance<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that does is there's a substance in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.740 
that does is there's a substance in
beans<00:01:27.450> called<00:01:27.900> phytic<00:01:28.560> acid<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.750> phytic

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
beans called phytic acid and that phytic

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
beans called phytic acid and that phytic
acid<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.579> prevents<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.850> body<00:01:32.909> from

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
acid it prevents your body from

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.590 
acid it prevents your body from
absorbing<00:01:34.340> nutrients<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.610> iron<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.570> zinc

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
absorbing nutrients like iron and zinc

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.789 
absorbing nutrients like iron and zinc
and<00:01:37.350> calcium<00:01:37.950> etc<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> when<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> reduce

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and calcium etc and that when you reduce

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
and calcium etc and that when you reduce
that<00:01:41.159> phytic<00:01:41.700> acid<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.630> you'll<00:01:42.869> increase

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that phytic acid then you'll increase

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.719 
that phytic acid then you'll increase
your<00:01:43.590> absorption<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.299> nutrients<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.729> you

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
your absorption of the nutrients and you

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.940 
your absorption of the nutrients and you
know<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.210> years<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
know for years I did that in the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
know for years I did that in the
beginning<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> started<00:01:51.750> learning

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
beginning and then I started learning

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
beginning and then I started learning
more<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> more<00:01:52.799> about<00:01:53.040> cleansing<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
more and more about cleansing and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
more and more about cleansing and
detoxing<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.590> life

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
detoxing and I had all these life

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.209 
detoxing and I had all these life
changes<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.439> plate<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:59.040> full

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
changes that and and my plate was full

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.139 
changes that and and my plate was full
and<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> stopped<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.890> stopped

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and so I stopped I stopped

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.499 
and so I stopped I stopped
soaking<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.170> beans<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.909> grains<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
soaking the beans and the the grains and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.040 
soaking the beans and the the grains and
I<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:08.039> tired<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.270> didn't<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.750> enough

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
I just was tired or I didn't have enough

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.389 
I just was tired or I didn't have enough
time

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
time

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.270 
time
I am<00:02:10.549> for<00:02:10.849> whatever<00:02:11.060> reason<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.110> didn't<00:02:12.890> do<00:02:13.099> it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
I am for whatever reason I didn't do it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.899 
I am for whatever reason I didn't do it
and<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:14.769> today<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:15.799> was<00:02:16.129> reading<00:02:16.370> another

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
and so today I was reading another

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.759 
and so today I was reading another
article<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.629> talked<00:02:18.079> about<00:02:18.290> how<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
article that talked about how the

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.589 
article that talked about how the
phytates<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:20.299> have<00:02:20.510> benefits<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
phytates actually have benefits and so

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.319 
phytates actually have benefits and so
and<00:02:23.599> those<00:02:23.840> benefits<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:25.120> preventing<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
and those benefits of preventing the

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.259 
and those benefits of preventing the
absorption<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.109> iron<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:28.430> actually<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.239> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
absorption of iron can actually be a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.349 
absorption of iron can actually be a
benefit<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.049> iron<00:02:30.560> has<00:02:31.069> certain<00:02:31.640> cancer

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
to something I don't remember exactly
what<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.390> article<00:02:38.959> said<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.769> talked

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
what the article said but it talked

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.339 
what the article said but it talked
about<00:02:40.159> several<00:02:40.819> different<00:02:41.269> benefits<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
about several different benefits of the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.059 
about several different benefits of the
phytates

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
phytates

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.059 
phytates
and<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.639> then<00:02:43.849> I<00:02:43.879> thought<00:02:44.209> well<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.599> know

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
and so then I thought well you know

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.430 
and so then I thought well you know
everything<00:02:46.069> works<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:47.060> perfect<00:02:47.659> succession

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
everything works in perfect succession

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.430 
everything works in perfect succession
and<00:02:49.000> everything<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.629> way<00:02:50.659> it's<00:02:50.989> supposed

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
and everything is the way it's supposed

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.520 
and everything is the way it's supposed
to<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.879> past<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.780> past<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
to be and the past is the past and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.050 
to be and the past is the past and
everything<00:02:54.980> that's<00:02:55.129> happened<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:55.939> past

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
everything that's happened in the past

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.390 
everything that's happened in the past
is<00:02:56.629> exactly<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:57.439> was<00:02:57.590> supposed<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:58.189> have

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
is exactly what was supposed to have

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.750 
is exactly what was supposed to have
happened<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.090> so<00:03:01.180> now<00:03:02.180> though<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:03.260> I'm

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
happened and so now though now I'm

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.030 
happened and so now though now I'm
thinking<00:03:04.760> better<00:03:05.510> I'm<00:03:05.870> feeling<00:03:06.560> better

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
thinking better I'm feeling better

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.059 
thinking better I'm feeling better
and<00:03:07.220> I'm<00:03:07.639> desiring<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.480> increase<00:03:09.170> my<00:03:09.409> nutrient

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
and I'm desiring to increase my nutrient

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.360 
and I'm desiring to increase my nutrient
content<00:03:10.879> in<00:03:11.180> my<00:03:11.599> blood<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:13.040> start

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
content in my blood and to start

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.170 
content in my blood and to start
rebuilding<00:03:14.109> instead<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.290> breaking<00:03:15.919> down<00:03:16.180> my

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
rebuilding instead of breaking down my

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.530 
rebuilding instead of breaking down my
body<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.799> just<00:03:18.919> time<00:03:19.489> for<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.209> now

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
body and so it's just time for that now

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.970 
body and so it's just time for that now
and<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> that's<00:03:24.019> what<00:03:24.230> I'm<00:03:24.349> doing<00:03:24.379> I<00:03:24.859> am

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and so that's what I'm doing I am

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.300 
and so that's what I'm doing I am
soaking<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.489> beans<00:03:25.639> and<00:03:25.909> I'm<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:27.310> stand

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
soaking the beans and I'm not a stand

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.659 
soaking the beans and I'm not a stand
I'm<00:03:28.909> getting<00:03:29.329> more<00:03:29.510> protein<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.590> tastes<00:03:31.579> that

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
I'm getting more protein it tastes that

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.280 
I'm getting more protein it tastes that
way<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.150> me<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:33.220> more<00:03:34.220> nutrients<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.290> six

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
way to me and more nutrients and in six

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.649 
way to me and more nutrients and in six
months<00:03:36.409> I'll<00:03:36.859> do<00:03:37.010> another<00:03:37.250> nutrient<00:03:37.909> analysis

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
months I'll do another nutrient analysis

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.039 
months I'll do another nutrient analysis
and<00:03:38.930> take<00:03:39.409> a<00:03:39.440> look<00:03:39.709> at<00:03:39.829> it<00:03:39.979> again<00:03:40.419> so<00:03:41.419> thanks<00:03:41.959> so

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
read said that if you soak the beans in

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.050 
read said that if you soak the beans in
water<00:03:49.879> at<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> hundred<00:03:51.169> and<00:03:51.409> forty<00:03:51.829> degrees<00:03:52.060> for

water at a hundred and forty degrees for
three<00:03:53.540> hours<00:03:53.889> that<00:03:54.889> will<00:03:55.250> reduce<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.790> phytate

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
three hours that will reduce the phytate

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.949 
three hours that will reduce the phytate
content<00:03:57.260> by<00:03:57.919> about<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.609> same<00:03:58.639> amount<00:03:58.959> fifty

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
content by about the same amount fifty

content by about the same amount fifty
to<00:04:00.109> sixty<00:04:00.290> percent<00:04:00.729> reduction<00:04:01.760> as<00:04:01.909> if<00:04:02.479> you

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
to sixty percent reduction as if you

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.719 
to sixty percent reduction as if you
were<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.900> soak<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.379> beans<00:04:03.560> for<00:04:04.099> eighteen

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
were to soak the beans for eighteen

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.199 
were to soak the beans for eighteen
hours<00:04:05.139> now<00:04:06.139> what<00:04:06.349> you<00:04:06.500> do<00:04:06.680> is<00:04:06.949> you<00:04:07.729> either<00:04:07.849> soak

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
hours now what you do is you either soak

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.149 
hours now what you do is you either soak
the<00:04:08.389> beans<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.989> long<00:04:09.139> time<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.919> in

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
the beans for a long time like that in

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.430 
the beans for a long time like that in
cold<00:04:10.400> water<00:04:10.699> and<00:04:10.940> then<00:04:11.599> dump<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.079> water<00:04:12.260> out

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
cold water and then dump the water out

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.309 
cold water and then dump the water out
rinse<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.549> beans<00:04:13.729> fill<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.690> with<00:04:14.840> water<00:04:15.109> again

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
rinse the beans fill it with water again

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.610 
rinse the beans fill it with water again
and<00:04:15.530> then<00:04:15.829> cook<00:04:16.130> or<00:04:16.479> you<00:04:17.479> soak<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:18.019> beans<00:04:18.169> in

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
and then cook or you soak the beans in

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.610 
and then cook or you soak the beans in
water<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:19.459> about<00:04:19.579> 140<00:04:20.570> degrees<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.409> might

water at about 140 degrees and you might

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.180 
water at about 140 degrees and you might
use<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.159> low<00:04:22.430> temperature

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
use the low temperature

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.600 
use the low temperature
on<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.310> slow<00:04:23.640> cooker<00:04:24.200> for<00:04:25.200> three<00:04:25.590> hours<00:04:25.980> once

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.420 
on a slow cooker for three hours once
again<00:04:26.940> dump<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.570> water<00:04:27.750> rinse<00:04:28.680> dump<00:04:29.280> the

water fill with water again and then
cook<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.630> that's<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:35.220> learned<00:04:35.550> and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
cook so that's what I have learned and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.360 
cook so that's what I have learned and
that<00:04:36.270> will<00:04:36.450> reduce<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.900> phytate<00:04:37.500> content<00:04:38.100> by

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
that will reduce the phytate content by

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.090 
that will reduce the phytate content by
fifty<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.150> sixty<00:04:39.360> percent<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:40.320> graduate<00:04:41.040> and
