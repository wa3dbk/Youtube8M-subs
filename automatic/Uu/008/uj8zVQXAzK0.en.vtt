00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
top and you can do a lot of other stuff
like<00:01:10.140> overclocking<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> CPU<00:01:15.740> processor<00:01:17.000> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like overclocking the CPU processor it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
like overclocking the CPU processor it
has<00:01:18.060> set<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.420> minimum<00:01:18.960> speed<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.920> maximum

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
has set the minimum speed or the maximum

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
has set the minimum speed or the maximum
speed<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.330> overclock<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.319> to<00:01:22.440> one

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
speed you can overclock it up to one

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.840 
speed you can overclock it up to one
point<00:01:22.800> four<00:01:23.069> gigahertz

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
point four gigahertz

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
point four gigahertz
I<00:01:23.970> recommend<00:01:24.659> overclocking<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> point

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I recommend overclocking it at one point

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
I recommend overclocking it at one point
to<00:01:26.819> because<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.869> point<00:01:28.080> four<00:01:28.289> consumes<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.159> lot

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
to because one point four consumes a lot

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.080 
to because one point four consumes a lot
of<00:01:29.729> battery<00:01:30.240> battery<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.340> sometimes<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
of battery battery and sometimes the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.830 
of battery battery and sometimes the
system<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.569> overheat<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.319> bit<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.069> no

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
system can overheat a little bit but no

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
system can overheat a little bit but no
performance<00:01:36.840> issues<00:01:37.170> whatsoever

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
performance issues whatsoever

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.089 
performance issues whatsoever
the<00:01:39.330> ROM<00:01:39.539> comes<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.080> plenty<00:01:40.319> of<00:01:40.500> apps

I<00:01:41.450> then<00:01:42.450> stalled<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.899> apps<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:43.440> extra

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I then stalled some apps here extra

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.040
