never been a study that shows that

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.079 
never been a study that shows that
hormones<00:00:12.750> produce<00:00:13.230> cancer<00:00:13.830> okay<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> there

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
hormones produce cancer okay and there

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
hormones produce cancer okay and there
the<00:00:15.360> more<00:00:15.570> times<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.139> study<00:00:16.470> hormones<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the more times they study hormones the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.529 
the more times they study hormones the
more<00:00:17.369> information<00:00:17.970> we're<00:00:18.119> learning<00:00:18.270> about

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
more information we're learning about

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
more information we're learning about
hormones<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.619> more<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.070> finding<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
hormones the more we're finding that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.630 
hormones the more we're finding that
hormones<00:00:21.150> make<00:00:21.420> people<00:00:21.900> healthier<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.640> it's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
hormones make people healthier and it's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
hormones make people healthier and it's
a<00:00:23.760> huge<00:00:23.970> discrepancy<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.869> run<00:00:25.080> into<00:00:25.199> this

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
a huge discrepancy and I run into this

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
a huge discrepancy and I run into this
every<00:00:25.740> day<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.670> patients

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
every day because a lot of my patients

when'd<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.640> those<00:01:02.820> diseases<00:01:03.149> happen<00:01:03.780> they

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
when'd of those diseases happen they

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
when'd of those diseases happen they
happen<00:01:04.260> we're<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:04.860> older<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> 50<00:01:05.790> 60<00:01:06.210> s<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
happen we're more older the 50 60 s and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
happen we're more older the 50 60 s and
that's<00:01:06.689> exactly<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.560> time<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.100> was

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that's exactly the same time so it was
