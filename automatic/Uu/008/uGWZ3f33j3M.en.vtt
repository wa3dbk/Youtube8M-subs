00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.670 
not it's not necessarily different from
anything<00:02:22.670> else<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.780> vanilla<00:02:24.500> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
anything else it's just a vanilla and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.449 
anything else it's just a vanilla and
chocolate<00:02:24.829> ice<00:02:25.069> cream

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
chocolate ice cream

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.300 
chocolate ice cream
honestly<00:02:25.880> swirl<00:02:26.209> together<00:02:26.389> and<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.190> had

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
honestly swirl together and if it had

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.860 
honestly swirl together and if it had
more<00:02:28.489> cake<00:02:28.700> pieces<00:02:29.090> or<00:02:29.239> if<00:02:29.359> we<00:02:29.480> run<00:02:29.660> across

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
more cake pieces or if we run across

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.750 
more cake pieces or if we run across
cake<00:02:30.230> pieces<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:30.889> that<00:02:31.130> may<00:02:31.250> change<00:02:31.489> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
cake pieces then that may change the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.250 
cake pieces then that may change the
flavor<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.239> bit<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:32.959> those

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.400
