all<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.609> run<00:00:17.910> around<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.240> map<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.570> an

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
all I do is run around the map like an

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
all I do is run around the map like an
idiot<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> then<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
idiot and then a little like it at this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.640

bottom of screen and says Supply Drop
earned<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.350> something<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.010> that's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

all<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.869> open

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
all I really know about it then I open

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
all I really know about it then I open
it<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:29.220> enlisted<00:00:29.910> knee<00:00:30.150> pads

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it and then I get enlisted knee pads

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
it and then I get enlisted knee pads
like<00:00:30.630> 10<00:00:30.840> times<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> 10<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.769> hopefully

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
like 10 times out of 10 so hopefully

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780 
like 10 times out of 10 so hopefully
today<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.160> stick<00:00:35.640> our

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
today we can kind of you know stick our

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.670 
today we can kind of you know stick our
toe<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.300> water<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.960> bit<00:00:37.170> more<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
toe in the water a little bit more and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
toe in the water a little bit more and
figure<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.210> bit<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.510> about

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
figure out a little bit more about

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.270 
figure out a little bit more about
supply<00:00:40.020> drops<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.739> understand

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
supply drops and we can all understand

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000 
supply drops and we can all understand
it<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.610> hopefully<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:43.110> works<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.860> can

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it and hopefully if all works out we can

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
it and hopefully if all works out we can
find<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.489> some<00:00:44.760> ways<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> increase<00:00:45.450> our

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
find out some ways to increase our

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
find out some ways to increase our
chances<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.289> doubtful<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.070> going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
chances it's doubtful but we're going

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.500 
chances it's doubtful but we're going
we're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.360> some

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
we're going to take a look at some

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
we're going to take a look at some

like that we're going to take a look at

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.960 
like that we're going to take a look at
that<00:02:14.500> right<00:02:14.740> here<00:02:15.010> now<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.490> guns<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that right here now so guns are a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.760 
that right here now so guns are a
35-percent<00:02:16.780> chances<00:02:17.350> you're<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:17.710> a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
35-percent chances you're going to get a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.380 
35-percent chances you're going to get a
weapon<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.850> know<00:02:18.940> whether<00:02:19.120> being

an elite weapon I don't really know

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.330 
an elite weapon I don't really know
obviously<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.590> kind<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.920> rolling

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
obviously this is kind of like rolling

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.840 
obviously this is kind of like rolling
two<00:02:24.580> dice<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> first<00:02:25.420> ice<00:02:26.460> it's<00:02:27.460> obviously

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
two dice the first ice it's obviously

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.060 
two dice the first ice it's obviously
extremely<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.570> weighted<00:02:29.020> dice<00:02:29.200> enlist<00:02:29.920> is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
extremely like weighted dice enlist is

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.310 
extremely like weighted dice enlist is
going<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.370> fifty<00:02:30.730> five<00:02:30.940> percent<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:32.200> it's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
going to be fifty five percent but it's

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.630 
going to be fifty five percent but it's
kind<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.710> first<00:02:32.920> dice<00:02:33.130> roll<00:02:33.400> since

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
kind of like the first dice roll since

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.310 
kind of like the first dice roll since
he<00:02:33.760> forget<00:02:34.030> enlisted<00:02:34.420> professional<00:02:34.930> or<00:02:35.050> elite

he forget enlisted professional or elite
and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:36.160> once<00:02:36.670> that's<00:02:36.880> decided<00:02:37.540> it'll<00:02:37.780> roll

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then once that's decided it'll roll

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.020 
and then once that's decided it'll roll
for<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> guns<00:02:38.470> reinforcements<00:02:39.460> or<00:02:39.550> apparel

for the guns reinforcements or apparel

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.550 
for the guns reinforcements or apparel
and<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.300> eventually<00:02:40.510> it'll<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:40.990> like<00:02:41.140> okay

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and that eventually it'll be like okay

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.500 
and that eventually it'll be like okay
he<00:02:41.710> gotten<00:02:41.980> an<00:02:42.040> enlisted<00:02:42.580> apparel<00:02:43.090> here's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
but you know point is that's kind of

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.890 
but you know point is that's kind of
like<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.610> concept<00:02:49.000> behind<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.390> like<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.690> said

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
like the concept behind it like I said

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.810 
like the concept behind it like I said
obviously<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.530> dice<00:02:50.710> is<00:02:50.950> extremely<00:02:51.460> waited

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
obviously the dice is extremely waited

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.490 
obviously the dice is extremely waited

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
if the enlisted can be fifty five

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.880 
if the enlisted can be fifty five
percent<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.190> elite<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.910> only<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.180> 15<00:02:55.630> so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
percent and the elite can only be 15 so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.260 
percent and the elite can only be 15 so
anyway<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.070> reinforcement<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.910> twenty

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
wanted to think about this because if

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.980 
wanted to think about this because if
there's<00:04:31.000> an<00:04:31.090> eleven<00:04:31.389> percent<00:04:31.630> chance<00:04:31.840> of

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
there's an eleven percent chance of

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.780 
there's an eleven percent chance of
getting<00:04:32.229> an<00:04:32.380> elite<00:04:32.650> weapon<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.430> Supply<00:04:33.729> Drop

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
getting an elite weapon in a Supply Drop

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.420 
getting an elite weapon in a Supply Drop
and<00:04:34.240> there<00:04:35.080> are<00:04:35.229> like<00:04:35.440> let's<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.340> say

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
and there are like let's just say

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.040 
and there are like let's just say
they're<00:04:36.580> forty<00:04:36.970> guns<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.389> game<00:04:37.570> there's

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
they're forty guns in the game there's

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.830 
they're forty guns in the game there's
no<00:04:38.320> way<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:38.979> I<00:04:39.100> get<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.669> forty<00:04:40.210> percent

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
no way that if I get that forty percent

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.469 
no way that if I get that forty percent
or<00:04:41.229> know<00:04:41.410> that<00:04:41.560> eleven<00:04:41.949> percent<00:04:42.340> 40<00:04:43.210> times

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
or know that eleven percent 40 times

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.659 
or know that eleven percent 40 times
that<00:04:43.690> I'm<00:04:43.780> going<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> get<00:04:44.050> every<00:04:44.320> single<00:04:44.669> elite

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
that I'm going to get every single elite

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.730 
that I'm going to get every single elite
weapon<00:04:46.120> in<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.389> game<00:04:46.540> because<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:47.169> definitely

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
weapon in the game because I definitely

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.500 
weapon in the game because I definitely
think<00:04:48.010> there<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.340> something<00:04:48.790> in<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.060> game<00:04:49.270> or

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
think there is something in the game or

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.090 
think there is something in the game or
something<00:04:49.780> that<00:04:49.870> makes<00:04:50.020> better<00:04:50.410> weapons<00:04:50.949> or

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
something that makes better weapons or

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.280 
something that makes better weapons or
better<00:04:51.340> elite<00:04:51.699> guns<00:04:51.940> rare<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:52.810> more

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
better elite guns rare and more

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.830 
better elite guns rare and more
difficult<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:54.130> get<00:04:54.510> than<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.660> traditional

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
difficult to get than the traditional

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.279 
difficult to get than the traditional
like<00:04:57.120> elite<00:04:58.120> crossbows<00:04:58.750> or<00:04:58.960> something<00:04:59.199> like

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
like elite crossbows or something like

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.689 
like elite crossbows or something like
that<00:04:59.350> that<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.680> showcase<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.220> my<00:05:00.310> video<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
that that I showcase to my video the

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.129 
that that I showcase to my video the
other<00:05:00.760> day<00:05:00.850> because<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.240> feel<00:05:01.419> like<00:05:01.449> Italy

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
other day because I feel like Italy

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.650 
other day because I feel like Italy
cross<00:05:02.410> for<00:05:02.650> an<00:05:02.740> elite<00:05:02.919> launcher<00:05:03.460> or<00:05:03.660> some

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
cross for an elite launcher or some

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.750 
cross for an elite launcher or some
elite<00:05:05.139> s<00:05:05.320> 12<00:05:05.770> shotgun<00:05:06.160> or<00:05:06.370> something<00:05:06.699> like

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
elite s 12 shotgun or something like

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270 
elite s 12 shotgun or something like
that<00:05:06.820> is<00:05:07.120> way<00:05:07.720> more<00:05:07.990> popular<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.949> you're

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
that is way more popular and if you're

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.560 
that is way more popular and if you're
going<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.550> get<00:05:09.669> an<00:05:09.760> elite<00:05:10.030> gun<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.419> like

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
going to get an elite gun it's like

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.420 
going to get an elite gun it's like
ninety<00:05:10.930> percent<00:05:11.080> going<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.500> be<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.039> like

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
ninety percent going to be that and like

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.860 
ninety percent going to be that and like
point<00:05:12.789> five<00:05:13.060> percent<00:05:13.479> going<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.720> be<00:05:13.810> an

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
point five percent going to be an

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.480 
point five percent going to be an
obsidian<00:05:14.139> steed<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:14.710> not<00:05:14.919> really<00:05:15.100> sure<00:05:15.370> how

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
obsidian steed so not really sure how

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.010 
obsidian steed so not really sure how
that<00:05:15.669> works<00:05:15.789> or<00:05:16.000> what<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.180> probability<00:05:16.780> is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
that works or what that probability is

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.659 
that works or what that probability is
that<00:05:17.289> would<00:05:17.710> obviously<00:05:17.800> be<00:05:18.130> an<00:05:18.220> extremely

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
that would obviously be an extremely

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.820 
that would obviously be an extremely
long<00:05:19.030> and<00:05:19.090> like<00:05:19.449> difficult<00:05:19.720> study<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.560> figure

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
long and like difficult study to figure

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.760 
long and like difficult study to figure
out<00:05:20.949> you<00:05:21.850> know<00:05:21.880> what<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.300> actual<00:05:22.960> probability

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
out you know what the actual probability

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.860 
out you know what the actual probability
of<00:05:23.860> getting<00:05:24.039> an<00:05:24.370> obsidian<00:05:24.760> ste<00:05:25.270> dracut<00:05:25.720> I'll

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
of getting an obsidian ste dracut I'll

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.540 
of getting an obsidian ste dracut I'll
rip<00:05:26.050> it<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.229> Supply<00:05:26.470> Drop<00:05:26.530> but<00:05:27.099> I<00:05:27.130> definitely

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
rip it a Supply Drop but I definitely

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.010 
rip it a Supply Drop but I definitely
think<00:05:27.789> there<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.120> something<00:05:28.450> in<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.810> game

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
think there is something in the game

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.080 
think there is something in the game
that<00:05:29.470> makes<00:05:29.680> you<00:05:29.950> no<00:05:30.039> better<00:05:30.070> weapons<00:05:30.820> like

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
that makes you no better weapons like

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.920 
that makes you no better weapons like
the<00:05:31.389> ASM<00:05:31.900> one<00:05:32.200> for<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.889> VA<00:05:33.070> el<00:05:33.250> 27<00:05:33.849> or<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.300> k-12

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
the ASM one for the VA el 27 or a k-12

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.290 
the ASM one for the VA el 27 or a k-12
way<00:05:35.710> more<00:05:36.099> difficult<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.669> get<00:05:36.789> elite<00:05:37.000> weapons

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
way more difficult to get elite weapons

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.060 
way more difficult to get elite weapons
for<00:05:37.479> other<00:05:37.900> than<00:05:38.050> something<00:05:38.229> like<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.500> crossbow

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
for other than something like a crossbow

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.129 
for other than something like a crossbow
or<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.700> know<00:05:39.789> bad<00:05:40.090> shotgun<00:05:40.389> or<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.690> secondary

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
or you know bad shotgun or a secondary

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.570 
or you know bad shotgun or a secondary
pistol<00:05:41.530> or<00:05:41.590> something<00:05:41.860> like<00:05:41.950> that<00:05:42.010> so<00:05:42.340> like<00:05:42.490> I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
pistol or something like that so like I

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.890 
pistol or something like that so like I
said<00:05:42.639> I<00:05:42.970> can't<00:05:43.360> really<00:05:43.539> test<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.870> out

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
said I can't really test that out

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.960 
said I can't really test that out
because<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.260> is<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.410> lot<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.770> lot<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.520> work<00:05:45.760> and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
because that is a lot of lot of work and

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.150 
because that is a lot of lot of work and
you<00:05:46.690> literally<00:05:47.020> need<00:05:47.200> like<00:05:47.410> thousands<00:05:48.039> of

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
you literally need like thousands of

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.100 
you literally need like thousands of
supply<00:05:48.460> drops<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:49.090> you<00:05:49.450> know<00:05:49.539> conduct<00:05:49.990> an

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
supply drops that you know conduct an

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.710 
supply drops that you know conduct an
accurate<00:05:50.620> study<00:05:50.919> so<00:05:51.880> that's<00:05:52.090> obviously<00:05:52.360> not

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
accurate study so that's obviously not

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.659 
accurate study so that's obviously not
possible<00:05:53.260> just<00:05:53.289> by<00:05:53.530> myself<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:54.220> maybe<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.520> can

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
possible just by myself so maybe I can

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.100 
possible just by myself so maybe I can
work<00:05:54.760> on<00:05:54.849> that<00:05:55.000> for<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.150> future<00:05:55.330> if<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.020> guys

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
work on that for a future if you guys

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.210 
work on that for a future if you guys
did<00:05:56.320> enjoy<00:05:56.380> this<00:05:56.620> video<00:05:56.710> if<00:05:56.919> you<00:05:57.010> could<00:05:57.099> go
