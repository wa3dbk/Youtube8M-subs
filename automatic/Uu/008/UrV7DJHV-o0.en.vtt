00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
trimmers from Westcott this first one is

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.439 
trimmers from Westcott this first one is
a<00:00:19.589> trim<00:00:20.099> error<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.550> they<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> trimmers

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a trim error now they have the trimmers

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.759 
a trim error now they have the trimmers
smaller<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:21.990> which<00:00:22.140> I've<00:00:22.320> shown<00:00:22.349> you<00:00:22.650> before

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
smaller one which I've shown you before

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.169 
smaller one which I've shown you before
but<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.759> is<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> new<00:00:24.300> 18<00:00:25.140> inch<00:00:25.470> long<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.789> 18

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
but this is the new 18 inch long one 18

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.040 
but this is the new 18 inch long one 18
inches<00:00:27.419> this<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.779> 10<00:00:28.109> inches<00:00:28.499> across<00:00:30.050> put

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
inches this way 10 inches across put

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.840 
inches this way 10 inches across put
your<00:00:31.199> paper<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.030> press<00:00:33.330> down

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.930 

and<00:00:38.850> cut<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.440> trimmer<00:00:41.310> can<00:00:41.490> do

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and cut now this trimmer can do

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.110 
and cut now this trimmer can do
something<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.540> 15<00:00:43.500> pages<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> 20<00:00:44.820> pound

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
something like 15 pages of the 20 pound

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.470 
something like 15 pages of the 20 pound
paper<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> most<00:00:46.650> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> paper<00:00:47.330> you'll<00:00:48.330> be

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
paper but most of the paper you'll be

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.820 
paper but most of the paper you'll be
cutting<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.990> would<00:00:49.170> probably<00:00:49.470> be<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.770> than

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
cutting with would probably be more than

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:58.550 
cutting with would probably be more than
that<00:00:50.810> however<00:00:55.310> it<00:00:56.310> will<00:00:56.580> cut<00:00:56.970> I'm<00:00:57.570> thinking<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
that however it will cut I'm thinking it

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.710 
that however it will cut I'm thinking it
should<00:00:58.830> cut<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.250> three<00:00:59.820> pieces<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.690> let's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
should cut about three pieces so let's

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.400 
should cut about three pieces so let's
test<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:03.890> they<00:01:04.890> cut<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.180> third<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.110> so

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
test it they cut to the third one not so

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.200 
test it they cut to the third one not so
so<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.250> cutting<00:01:08.550> multiples<00:01:09.060> I'd

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so if you were cutting multiples I'd

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.360 
so if you were cutting multiples I'd
probably<00:01:09.600> stick<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:10.050> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> cardstock<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
probably stick to this is cardstock I

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.060 
probably stick to this is cardstock I
would<00:01:12.060> probably<00:01:12.270> stick<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.900> cutting<00:01:13.320> two

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
would probably stick to just cutting two

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.630 
would probably stick to just cutting two
pieces<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:15.380> cardstock<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.800> a<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.460> had

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
pieces of cardstock at a time if you had

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570 
pieces of cardstock at a time if you had
to<00:01:17.760> cut<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.020> piece<00:01:19.260> at<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.470> time<00:01:19.580> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to cut more than one piece at a time and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
to cut more than one piece at a time and
that<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.240> you'll<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> really

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that way you know you'll get a really

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.010 
that way you know you'll get a really
nice<00:01:22.440> cut<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> other<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.330> too<00:01:24.510> is<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.840> has

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
nice cut the other thing too is it has

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
nice cut the other thing too is it has
blade<00:01:25.350> storage<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.490> front<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
blade storage over here in the front so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
blade storage over here in the front so
if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.230> extra<00:01:28.260> blades<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:29.100> fits<00:01:29.370> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
if you had some extra blades it fits a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
if you had some extra blades it fits a
couple<00:01:29.760> blades<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:31.940> so<00:01:32.940> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.630> nice

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
couple blades in there so this is a nice

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
couple blades in there so this is a nice
trimmer<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.770> need<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> space<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.820> store<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
trimmer you need the space to store it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
trimmer you need the space to store it

that<00:02:20.440> way<00:02:20.620> your<00:02:20.980> blade<00:02:21.430> isn't<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.060> flying

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
that way your blade isn't just flying

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.440

it cut three now this one the other one
was<00:03:00.850> was<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:02.010> 15<00:03:03.010> pages<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.790> 20-pound<00:03:04.240> this<00:03:04.510> one

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
was was it 15 pages of 20-pound this one

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.310 
was was it 15 pages of 20-pound this one
is<00:03:04.840> Posey<00:03:05.110> 30<00:03:05.709> pages<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.490> 20-pound<00:03:07.320> but

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
is Posey 30 pages of 20-pound but

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.270 
is Posey 30 pages of 20-pound but
cardstock<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.860> course<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.490> heavier<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.040> there

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
cardstock of course is heavier but there

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.690 
cardstock of course is heavier but there
we<00:03:12.459> had<00:03:12.959> six<00:03:13.959> pieces<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.620> cardstock<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.489> it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
we had six pieces of cardstock and it

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.790 
we had six pieces of cardstock and it
was<00:03:15.820> cut<00:03:16.060> through<00:03:16.360> all<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.170> think

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
was cut through all of it I think

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.270 
was cut through all of it I think
basically<00:03:18.190> if<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.000> fits<00:03:19.950> through<00:03:20.950> this

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
basically if it fits through this

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.729 
basically if it fits through this
plastic<00:03:22.030> once<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.600> get<00:03:22.780> start<00:03:23.140> getting<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.530> lot

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
plastic once you get start getting a lot

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.250 
plastic once you get start getting a lot
there<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.040> wouldn't<00:03:24.670> do<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> think<00:03:25.989> if<00:03:26.110> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
there I wouldn't do it but I think if it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.870 
there I wouldn't do it but I think if it
fits<00:03:26.500> under<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.830> plastic<00:03:27.400> it'll<00:03:27.550> probably

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
fits under the plastic it'll probably

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.390 
fits under the plastic it'll probably
cut<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.110> two<00:03:29.350> little<00:03:29.620> pieces<00:03:29.800> here<00:03:30.160> now

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
cut it I have two little pieces here now

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.140 
cut it I have two little pieces here now
to<00:03:31.390> try<00:03:31.630> but<00:03:32.560> again<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.340> you're<00:03:33.580> doing<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.910> lot
