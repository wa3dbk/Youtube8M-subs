from their body and healthy meal

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.780 
from their body and healthy meal
them<00:02:08.399> naturally<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.629> easily<00:02:10.099> also<00:02:11.099> clay<00:02:11.670> has

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
them naturally and easily also clay has

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.849 
them naturally and easily also clay has
been<00:02:11.969> shown<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.390> help<00:02:12.510> pull<00:02:12.870> radiation<00:02:13.680> and

heavy metals and other toxins from the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
heavy metals and other toxins from the
body<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.409> really<00:02:16.590> makes<00:02:16.950> sense<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.609> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
body so it really makes sense as a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
body so it really makes sense as a
simple<00:02:18.599> straightforward<00:02:19.519> cleansing<00:02:20.519> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

issue eat early water is helpful and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160 
issue eat early water is helpful and
especially<00:02:39.239> with<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.480> clay<00:02:39.689> because<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.930> has

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
especially with the clay because it has

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.759 
especially with the clay because it has
an<00:02:40.349> absorbent<00:02:40.829> action<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.989> in

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
an absorbent action and it's really in

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.410 
an absorbent action and it's really in
the<00:02:43.980> essential<00:02:44.340> part<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.730> process<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the essential part of the process so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.409 
the essential part of the process so
secondary<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.859> clay<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.459> supportive<00:02:48.269> to

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
secondary to the clay and supportive to

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.809 
secondary to the clay and supportive to
the<00:02:48.540> clay<00:02:48.750> would<00:02:49.049> also<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.530> large<00:02:50.220> doses<00:02:50.790> of

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
the clay would also be large doses of

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.360 
the clay would also be large doses of
probiotics<00:02:51.980> especially<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.099> there<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
probiotics especially if there is a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.490 
probiotics especially if there is a
bacterial<00:02:54.120> imbalance<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.109> system

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bacterial imbalance in the system

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.520 
bacterial imbalance in the system
getting<00:02:56.129> large<00:02:56.489> doses<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.409> probiotics<00:02:58.409> or

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
getting large doses of probiotics or

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.129 
getting large doses of probiotics or
beneficial<00:02:59.129> bacteria<00:02:59.280> is<00:03:00.209> extremely<00:03:00.900> helpful

beneficial bacteria is extremely helpful

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.429 
beneficial bacteria is extremely helpful
and<00:03:01.319> extremely<00:03:01.680> beneficial<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> what<00:03:03.689> I<00:03:03.720> don't

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
and extremely beneficial so what I don't

just take a capsule that'll help

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.259 
just take a capsule that'll help
in<00:03:10.379> reality<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.159> need<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> take<00:03:11.549> half<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
in reality you need to take half the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.270 
in reality you need to take half the
puddle<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.440> way<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.949> entire

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
puddle all the way up to that entire

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
puddle all the way up to that entire
bottle<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.209> make<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.389> real<00:03:15.720> significant

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
bottle to make a real significant

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.349 
bottle to make a real significant
difference<00:03:16.859> if<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.609> think<00:03:17.790> about<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.150> it's

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
difference if you think about it it's

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.210 
difference if you think about it it's
usually<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.930> twenty<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.379> thirty<00:03:19.650> dollars<00:03:20.010> which

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
usually a twenty or thirty dollars which

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.759 
usually a twenty or thirty dollars which
is<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.729> not<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:20.909> much<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.720> contrast<00:03:22.560> with

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
is really not that much in contrast with

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.520 
is really not that much in contrast with
how<00:03:23.040> horrible<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.970> usually<00:03:24.389> feel<00:03:24.690> when<00:03:25.290> going

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
how horrible we usually feel when going

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
how horrible we usually feel when going
through<00:03:25.650> these<00:03:25.949> sort<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.310> things<00:03:26.489> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
through these sort of things and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.849 
through these sort of things and
especially<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.169> start<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
especially if it can really start to

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.289 
especially if it can really start to
restore<00:03:29.040> balance<00:03:29.430> pretty<00:03:29.849> quickly<00:03:30.090> and

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
restore balance pretty quickly and

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.390 
restore balance pretty quickly and
easily<00:03:30.479> so<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.440> really<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.949> the<00:03:31.979> two

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
easily so that's really the the two

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.759 
easily so that's really the the two
simple<00:03:32.819> strategies<00:03:33.269> number<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:33.769> meant

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
simple strategies number one meant

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.159 
simple strategies number one meant
tonight<00:03:34.889> clay<00:03:35.340> which<00:03:35.609> I<00:03:35.729> said<00:03:36.000> again<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.989> can

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
tonight clay which I said again you can

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.349 
tonight clay which I said again you can
get<00:03:37.349> really<00:03:37.859> cheaply<00:03:38.220> really<00:03:38.819> easily<00:03:39.150> and

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
get really cheaply really easily and

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.050 
get really cheaply really easily and
it's<00:03:39.449> good<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:39.959> around<00:03:40.639> number<00:03:41.639> two

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
it's good to just have around number two

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's good to just have around number two
high<00:03:42.419> doses<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:43.049> probiotics<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.489> even<00:03:44.729> just

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
high doses of probiotics so even just

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.490 
high doses of probiotics so even just
those<00:03:45.120> two<00:03:45.359> things<00:03:45.540> together<00:03:45.810> can<00:03:46.199> really

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
those two things together can really

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.349 
those two things together can really
help<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.829> restore<00:03:47.159> balance<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.819> system

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
help to restore balance to the system

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.899 
help to restore balance to the system
something<00:03:48.930> I've<00:03:49.229> used<00:03:49.609> actually<00:03:50.609> in<00:03:50.760> this

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
something I've used actually in this

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.969 
something I've used actually in this
past<00:03:51.239> week<00:03:51.510> for<00:03:51.780> some<00:03:51.989> reason<00:03:52.379> there<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.680> just

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
past week for some reason there was just

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.860 
past week for some reason there was just
something<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.340> was<00:03:53.579> going<00:03:53.879> around<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.689> would

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
something that was going around it would

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.629 
something that was going around it would
didn't<00:03:55.109> really<00:03:55.290> affect<00:03:55.349> me<00:03:55.709> too<00:03:55.919> majorly<00:03:56.370> it

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
just had some minor imbalances that

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.649 
just had some minor imbalances that
arose<00:03:59.040> whereas<00:03:59.340> other<00:03:59.549> people<00:03:59.879> were<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.540> know

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
arose whereas other people were you know

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.390 
arose whereas other people were you know
knocked<00:04:00.930> out<00:04:01.169> for<00:04:01.439> days<00:04:01.620> or<00:04:01.859> laid<00:04:02.010> out<00:04:02.159> for

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.159 
knocked out for days or laid out for
days<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.939> was<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> good<00:04:03.329> thing<00:04:03.569> but<00:04:04.109> I

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
days so that was a good thing but I

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.659 
days so that was a good thing but I
noticed<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.620> was<00:04:04.709> just<00:04:04.859> kind<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.069> annoying<00:04:05.370> how

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
noticed it was just kind of annoying how

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.490 
noticed it was just kind of annoying how
dealing<00:04:06.030> with<00:04:06.150> imbalance<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.259> it<00:04:07.319> took<00:04:07.439> some

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
dealing with imbalance so it took some

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.729 
dealing with imbalance so it took some
clay<00:04:07.919> after<00:04:08.639> couple<00:04:09.120> doses<00:04:09.389> things<00:04:10.290> got<00:04:10.530> back

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
clay after couple doses things got back

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.679 
clay after couple doses things got back
to<00:04:10.769> normal<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.400> now<00:04:11.609> today<00:04:11.939> everything<00:04:12.509> is
