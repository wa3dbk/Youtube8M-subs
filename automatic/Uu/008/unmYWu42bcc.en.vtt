working as you can see i'm running
resonable<00:00:11.340> remake<00:00:12.889> only<00:00:13.889> problem<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.460> runs

resonable remake only problem is it runs

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.660 
resonable remake only problem is it runs
epically<00:00:15.719> slow<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:17.430> know<00:00:17.490> how

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
epically slow like you don't know how

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.310 
epically slow like you don't know how
slow<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.119> running<00:00:20.449> before<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.630> had<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.260> really

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
slow is running before I had like really

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560 
slow is running before I had like really
really<00:00:22.680> weird<00:00:23.240> models<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.390> were<00:00:24.449> all

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
really weird models they were all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.240 
really weird models they were all
stretched<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> everything<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:25.830> looking

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
stretched and everything it was looking

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.300 
stretched and everything it was looking
awful<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> fixed<00:00:27.960> might<00:00:28.920> post<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
awful I got that fixed might post a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.770 
awful I got that fixed might post a
video<00:00:29.460> about<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.289> anyways<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> see

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
video about it anyways I you can see

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.500 
video about it anyways I you can see
that<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> doorknob<00:00:34.440> comes<00:00:34.739> right<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:34.950> here

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
that the doorknob comes right off here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.180 
that the doorknob comes right off here
and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.309> cosine<00:00:38.309> coming<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> door

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
and the cosine coming to the door

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
and the cosine coming to the door
strange<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.640> shading<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.120> nearly<00:00:42.360> rate<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
strange the shading is nearly rate and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.569 
strange the shading is nearly rate and
you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.200> Chris<00:00:43.860> looks<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> just

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

walked<00:00:44.910> through<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.210> pillar<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:46.170> almost

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
walked through the pillar it almost

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
walked through the pillar it almost
looks<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.610> version<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.180> residue<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
looks like my version of residue a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.310 
looks like my version of residue a
remake<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> ps1<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.590> computer<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:55.230> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
remake on ps1 for my computer you can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.779 
remake on ps1 for my computer you can
see<00:00:55.440> he's<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.620> phasing<00:00:56.160> through<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> stuff

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
see he's just phasing through the stuff

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.319 
see he's just phasing through the stuff
and<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:58.739> looks<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:01:00.030> better

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and it looks a lot like a lot better

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.980 
and it looks a lot like a lot better
than<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> gamecube<00:01:05.880> version

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.570 

with<00:01:09.990> doorknob<00:01:10.439> comes<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.890> everything<00:01:11.460> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
with doorknob comes off everything is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320 
with doorknob comes off everything is
slow<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.180> mean<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> game<00:01:14.610> only<00:01:14.790> runs<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> little

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
slow I mean the game only runs a little

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.969 
slow I mean the game only runs a little
bit<00:01:15.509> faster<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:16.020> certain<00:01:16.350> parts<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.860> that's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
bit faster at certain parts but that's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
bit faster at certain parts but that's
because<00:01:17.070> i'm<00:01:17.250> recording<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> slows<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because i'm recording it slows it down a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.140 
because i'm recording it slows it down a
little<00:01:19.220> anyways<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.640> Chris<00:01:20.939> faces

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
little anyways you can see Chris faces

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.780 
little anyways you can see Chris faces
through<00:01:21.750> stuff<00:01:25.369> right<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.729> gonna

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
through stuff right here you're gonna

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.230 
through stuff right here you're gonna
walking<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> foot<00:01:27.810> goes<00:01:27.990> over<00:01:28.229> top<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:29.240> was

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
walking so the foot goes over top I was

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.789 
walking so the foot goes over top I was
looking<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:30.990> pedestal<00:01:31.409> thing

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
looking for the little pedestal thing

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.350

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.710 
demonstration to show that I got it
working<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.240> possible<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
working and that it is possible to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.900 
working and that it is possible to
emulate<00:02:34.140> gamecube<00:02:34.620> games<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.220> computer

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
emulate gamecube games on your computer

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
emulate gamecube games on your computer
you<00:02:36.090> need<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> good<00:02:36.750> computer<00:02:37.020> if<00:02:37.200> i

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you need to have a good computer if i

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.480 
you need to have a good computer if i
had<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> better<00:02:37.560> computer<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.100> probably

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
had a better computer would probably

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.790 
had a better computer would probably
look<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> lot<00:02:38.970> better<00:02:39.180> i<00:02:39.510> might<00:02:40.500> run<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> little

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
look a lot better i might run a little

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.430 
look a lot better i might run a little
faster<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.270> yeah<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:45.960> checking<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
faster so yeah I was just checking that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.520 
faster so yeah I was just checking that
it<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.620> equipped<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:50.580> quipped<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.350> know<00:02:52.350> what

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it was equipped it's quipped I know what

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.100 
it was equipped it's quipped I know what
happens<00:02:52.860> here

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
happens here

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.050 
happens here
follow<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.890> didn't<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.490> was

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
follow I didn't know at the time was
