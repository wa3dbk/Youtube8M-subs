00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
well with the other key change which is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
well with the other key change which is
this<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.720> first<00:01:30.930> boat<00:01:31.259> designed<00:01:31.680> from<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this the first boat designed from the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.910 
this the first boat designed from the
ground<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:33.060> IPS<00:01:33.720> powered<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.770> that

ground up to be IPS powered now that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
ground up to be IPS powered now that
means<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> boat<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.759> achieve<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.689> quite

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
means this boat can achieve really quite

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.149 
means this boat can achieve really quite
impressive<00:01:37.590> 32<00:01:38.220> knots<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> pair<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:40.159> 435

really<00:01:44.250> good<00:01:44.369> performance

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
really good performance

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.190 
really good performance
I<00:01:46.700> guess<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.880> there's<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.300> word<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.930> would

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I guess if there's one word you would

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.740 
I guess if there's one word you would
have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> pick<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.760> describe<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.330> experience

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
have to pick to describe the experience

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
have to pick to describe the experience
of<00:01:51.810> driving<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> fare<00:01:52.440> line<00:01:52.620> Targa<00:01:52.980> 48<00:01:53.400> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
of driving the fare line Targa 48 it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.720 
of driving the fare line Targa 48 it
would<00:01:54.330> be<00:01:54.570> easygoing

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
would be easygoing

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.650 
would be easygoing
everything<00:01:56.730> about<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.150> driving<00:01:57.390> experience

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
everything about the driving experience

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.470 
everything about the driving experience
on<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.260> boat<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.620> very<00:01:59.060> relaxing<00:02:00.060> and

course its maneuverability is extremely
good<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.050> dive<00:02:08.540> quickly<00:02:09.540> into<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> turns

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
good you can dive quickly into the turns

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.340 
good you can dive quickly into the turns
but<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:12.540> never<00:02:12.720> feel<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.050> though<00:02:13.170> you've<00:02:13.320> been

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
but you never feel as though you've been

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.949 
but you never feel as though you've been
thrown<00:02:13.890> about<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.520> thrown<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.300> seat

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.660 

like<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> said<00:02:22.829> about<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.250> feels<00:02:23.430> very

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
like I said about that feels very

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.880 
like I said about that feels very
relaxing<00:02:24.379> one<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.560> things<00:02:25.709> that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
relaxing one of the things that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.550 
relaxing one of the things that
contributes<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.609> is<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.629> visibility

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
contributes to that is the visibility

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.259 
contributes to that is the visibility
from<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.859> boat<00:02:29.069> which<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.280> extraordinarily

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
from this boat which is extraordinarily

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.140 
from this boat which is extraordinarily
good<00:02:30.930> even<00:02:31.739> without<00:02:31.829> any<00:02:32.280> use<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.549> trim<00:02:32.909> tabs

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
good even without any use of trim tabs

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.800 
good even without any use of trim tabs
at<00:02:33.329> all

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
at all

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.899 
at all
the<00:02:34.109> climb<00:02:34.379> onto<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> plane<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.219> very<00:02:35.340> gentle

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
the climb onto the plane is very gentle

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.780 
the climb onto the plane is very gentle
and<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.989> always<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.469> a<00:02:37.739> whole<00:02:38.400> heap<00:02:38.639> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
and you can always see a whole heap of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.520 
and you can always see a whole heap of
horizon<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.450> front<00:02:39.719> of<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.139> never<00:02:40.319> feel

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
horizon in front of you you never feel

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.319 
horizon in front of you you never feel
as<00:02:40.680> though<00:02:40.799> you're<00:02:41.040> missing<00:02:41.819> anything<00:02:42.060> in

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
as though you're missing anything in

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.339 
as though you're missing anything in
front<00:02:42.599> at<00:02:42.870> all

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349

on<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.430> boat<00:02:44.609> this<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.939> a<00:02:44.969> few<00:02:45.239> sports

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
on this boat this one a few sports

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.690 
on this boat this one a few sports
cruises<00:02:45.959> I've<00:02:46.079> driven<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.219> sort<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.459> size

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
cruises I've driven of this sort of size

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.819 
cruises I've driven of this sort of size
where<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.299> instinct<00:02:48.719> is<00:02:48.840> not<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.170> stand<00:02:49.560> up

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
where the instinct is not to stand up

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.920 
where the instinct is not to stand up
and<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.579> because<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.030> visibility<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.719> so

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and that is because the visibility is so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.679 
and that is because the visibility is so
good<00:02:52.170> however<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.129> want<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.459> do<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.819> you

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
good however if you want to do that you

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.849 
good however if you want to do that you
can<00:02:55.430> slide<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.730> seat<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.750> stand<00:02:58.379> and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
can slide back the seat and stand and

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.589 
can slide back the seat and stand and
hear<00:02:59.129> clearly<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.329> through<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.319> opening

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599
