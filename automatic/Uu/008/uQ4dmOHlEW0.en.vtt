when<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.759> compared<00:01:22.209> with<00:01:22.359> rpm<00:01:22.899> one<00:01:23.109> it's<00:01:23.409> nearly

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
when I compared with rpm one it's nearly

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.830 
when I compared with rpm one it's nearly
identical<00:01:23.950> I<00:01:24.520> mean<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.819> design<00:01:24.999> is<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.749> little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
identical I mean the design is a little

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.099 
identical I mean the design is a little
bit<00:01:26.439> different<00:01:26.859> but<00:01:26.979> not<00:01:27.249> by<00:01:27.490> much<00:01:27.850> but<00:01:28.240> before

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
bit different but not by much but before

last<00:02:10.179> thing<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.689> is<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:11.110> run<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.439> wires

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
last thing to do is to run the wires

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
last thing to do is to run the wires
through<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.159> shock<00:02:12.370> tower<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.879> reattach<00:02:13.120> the

and<00:02:14.000> put<00:02:14.600> back<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.140> fin<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.620> there<00:02:16.190> you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and put back on the fin and there you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.360 
and put back on the fin and there you
have<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.880> am<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.450> done<00:02:17.920> next<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
have it I am all done next this is a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.240 
have it I am all done next this is a
first<00:02:19.840> rpm<00:02:20.840> rear<00:02:21.020> shock<00:02:21.320> tower<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.950> has<00:02:22.220> a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
first rpm rear shock tower that has a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.710 
first rpm rear shock tower that has a
fin<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.690> very<00:02:24.290> very<00:02:25.250> stable<00:02:25.820> way<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.480> mean

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
fin in a very very stable way I mean

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.960 
fin in a very very stable way I mean
look<00:02:26.960> at<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.140> that's<00:02:27.620> not<00:02:27.860> going<00:02:28.070> anywhere

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
look at that that's not going anywhere

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.000 
look at that that's not going anywhere
now<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.690> extra<00:02:30.050> thing<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.470> did<00:02:30.680> was<00:02:30.860> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
now one extra thing that I did was I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.040 
now one extra thing that I did was I
used<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.430> wire<00:02:31.640> tied<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.180> hold<00:02:32.360> down<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.630> cables

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
used a wire tied to hold down the cables

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.350 
used a wire tied to hold down the cables
mainly<00:02:33.800> due<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.100> fact<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.460> since<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.270> have

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
mainly due to the fact that since I have

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.870 
mainly due to the fact that since I have
a<00:02:35.390> battery<00:02:35.630> expansionpak<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.890> does<00:02:37.370> push<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
a battery expansionpak it does push the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.960 
a battery expansionpak it does push the
esc<00:02:38.360> rather<00:02:38.600> high<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:40.010> wires<00:02:40.220> tend<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.790> rub

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
esc rather high so the wires tend to rub

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.760 
esc rather high so the wires tend to rub
up<00:02:41.090> against<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> body<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.410> makes

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
up against the body and then it makes

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.740 
up against the body and then it makes
the<00:02:42.830> body<00:02:43.100> pop<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:43.880> bit<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.630> now

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the body pop up a little bit but now

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.450 
the body pop up a little bit but now
that<00:02:44.960> I<00:02:44.990> have<00:02:45.230> them<00:02:45.380> tied<00:02:45.620> down<00:02:45.800> like<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.250> I

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
that I have them tied down like that I

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.730 
that I have them tied down like that I
don't<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.910> worry<00:02:47.120> about<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.510> anymore<00:02:47.900> so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
don't have to worry about it anymore so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.050 
don't have to worry about it anymore so
there's<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.040> couple<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.400> things<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.790> should<00:02:49.970> go

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
there's a couple of things I should go

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.340 
there's a couple of things I should go
ahead<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.300> mention<00:02:50.570> if<00:02:50.990> you<00:02:51.020> plan<00:02:51.320> on

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
ahead and mention if you plan on

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.620 
ahead and mention if you plan on
installing<00:02:51.680> an<00:02:52.190> RPM<00:02:52.700> rear<00:02:52.880> shock<00:02:53.150> tower<00:02:53.180> on

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
installing an RPM rear shock tower on

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.410 
installing an RPM rear shock tower on
your<00:02:53.840> banded<00:02:54.290> realize<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.790> will<00:02:55.940> not<00:02:56.180> be

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
your banded realize that you will not be

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.200 
your banded realize that you will not be
able<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.840> attach<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.530> stock<00:02:57.890> wing<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
able to attach the stock wing to it the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.810 
able to attach the stock wing to it the
reason<00:02:59.390> why<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.080> stock<00:03:00.410> wing<00:03:00.680> uses<00:03:01.400> two

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
reason why is the stock wing uses two

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.210 
reason why is the stock wing uses two
metal<00:03:02.390> rods<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:03.050> go<00:03:03.110> into<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.710> middle<00:03:04.010> of

doesn't have a thick part for you to
drill<00:03:08.750> holes<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.710> could<00:03:09.980> not<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.400> that

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
drill holes so you could not do that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.270 
drill holes so you could not do that
modification<00:03:10.990> now<00:03:11.990> if<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.500> do<00:03:12.860> want<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.160> go

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
modification now if you do want to go

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.920 
modification now if you do want to go
ahead<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.610> do<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.030> get<00:03:14.240> rid<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.660> fin

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
ahead and do it and get rid of the fin

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.590 
ahead and do it and get rid of the fin
well<00:03:15.860> then<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.400> should<00:03:16.550> work<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.730> fine<00:03:17.030> I've

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
well then it should work just fine I've

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.720 
well then it should work just fine I've
had<00:03:18.080> no<00:03:18.440> problems<00:03:18.860> installing<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.640> the

Bandit it's a bit of modified just
because<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.370> wing<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.760> everything<00:03:23.180> but

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
because of the wing and everything but

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.660 
because of the wing and everything but
overall<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:24.020> think<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.560> looks<00:03:24.800> really<00:03:25.010> really

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
overall I think it looks really really

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.290 
overall I think it looks really really
good

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
good

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.050 
good
and<00:03:26.570> it's<00:03:27.140> always<00:03:27.350> nice<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:28.130> have<00:03:28.310> an<00:03:28.580> RPM

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.870 
and it's always nice to have an RPM
