remember that the paint should be

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.790 
remember that the paint should be
acrylic<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.990> bought<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.380> stuff<00:02:28.560> from<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800

acrylic and I bought this stuff from the
dollar<00:02:28.980> store<00:02:29.070> doesn't<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> be

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
dollar store doesn't have to be

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.170 
dollar store doesn't have to be
expensive<00:02:30.570> stuff<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.250> buy<00:02:32.430> any

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
expensive stuff just just go buy any

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.810

kind of acrylic paint and so I'm

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.910 
kind of acrylic paint and so I'm
probably<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.450> gonna<00:02:36.540> start<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.650> dress

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
probably I'm gonna start with the dress

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.230 
probably I'm gonna start with the dress
because<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.490> thing<00:02:38.670> that's<00:02:38.850> where<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
because the thing that's where I want to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.070 
because the thing that's where I want to
start<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.570> I'm<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.750> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> make<00:02:40.020> it

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
start and I'm just going to make it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.110 
start and I'm just going to make it
rainbow<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.710> say<00:02:40.920> we're<00:02:41.070> starting<00:02:41.460> with<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
rainbow like say we're starting with the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.810 
rainbow like say we're starting with the
red<00:02:42.300> on<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> base<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:44.280> red

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
red on the base because I like red

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:57.190 
red on the base because I like red
lifesavers<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.750> best

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.900 

and<00:02:57.590> I'm<00:02:57.980> gonna<00:02:58.069> have<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> few<00:02:58.670> coats

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
and I'm gonna have to do a few coats

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.809 
and I'm gonna have to do a few coats
because<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.510> brown<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> darker<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
because the brown is darker so the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.330 
because the brown is darker so the
colors<00:03:02.120> aren't<00:03:02.390> gonna<00:03:02.510> stay<00:03:02.810> on

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
colors aren't gonna stay on

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.449 
colors aren't gonna stay on
