00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.950
 the one that passes on youtube and others a video 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.010
 tutorial of the vega this video of 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.429
 white pokemon 2 and what will it consist 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.799
 is how to get a gable ching and a 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:19.260
 that that's a bit like a black grade 2 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.260
 or a drag team and without that year 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.090
 and you have a little flight and have 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.410
 unlocked this city the pokémon 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.660
 black that is what I have I would be the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.690
 black city in white I imagine that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.280
 it would be white city or white forest 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.760
 wood flying up there that seems to me 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.160
 it seems that you have to pass the league 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.900
 Ok then once they are here and 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.420
 appear in the pokemon center and we 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.010
 we direct 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.449
 to this building that is up here that 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.359
 it is called the black pokemon 2 the 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.820
 black skyscraper or the white and they are 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.609
 will call white skyscrapers I suppose and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.780
 good good puts badly gardée have to have 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.579
 because I put enough level 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 they have to have six so they can 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.710
 pass without difficulty and good the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.820
 black skyscraper has ten zones 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.290
 We will accept challenges and you will have zones 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.299
 first they start at 1 and then 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 unlock the 2 the 3 the dessert and so 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.740
 successively when they reach the diet and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.979
 is the boss waiting is the leader who 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.560
 it will be the son of the dead who is the hair 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.560
 red and once you win Jce will give you 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 a multicolored goat or without that the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.540
 black pokémon 2 or a mouse and without that 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.650
 be on target 2 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 once you pass you will give it to you 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.640
 pretty strong for fighting against me such 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.890
 but what happens is that you will have to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.140
 have a free space to catch the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 pokemon but good nothing happens because 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.220
 they can 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.960
 they can not go after anything 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.690
 youtube psoe on the behind of this 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.950
 video and so live is enough 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.560
 well his second evolution is gabi and his 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.870
 latest evolution is garzon then the one of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 drag team and it's like a blue snake and 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 white then evolves back to the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.460
 second version that I do not remember which 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.590
 was and the third is dragon and from that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.500
 He is also a dragon and they are pretty 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.300
 well because they are quite strong and they are 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.910
 singles that are very few in 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.040
