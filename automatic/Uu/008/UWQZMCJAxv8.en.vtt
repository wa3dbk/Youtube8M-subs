00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
for a viewfinder when I'm setting up

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.470 
for a viewfinder when I'm setting up
some<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.210> these<00:00:24.270> shots<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.640> with<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> grip<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
gonna go through the whole grip build

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
gonna go through the whole grip build
with<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.880> already<00:00:42.030> did<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
with you because I already did that in a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.020 
with you because I already did that in a
previous<00:00:42.780> video<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> tripod<00:00:45.300> came<00:00:46.230> from

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
previous video the tripod came from

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200 
previous video the tripod came from
monoprice<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.750> mini<00:00:48.989> pocket<00:00:49.590> tripod<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
monoprice this mini pocket tripod and I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
monoprice this mini pocket tripod and I
started<00:00:51.510> thinking<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.500> cell<00:00:52.770> phone

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
started thinking it has this cell phone

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.540 
started thinking it has this cell phone
cradle<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.530> turns<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.219> actually

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cradle in it and turns out it's actually

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
cradle in it and turns out it's actually
perfect<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.590> piece

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
perfect this is kind of just a piece

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
perfect this is kind of just a piece
that<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.399> figured<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.820> wasn't<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> use<00:01:00.480> but

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that I figured I wasn't going to use but

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
that I figured I wasn't going to use but
actually<00:01:01.829> works<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.489> well<00:01:02.840> what<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
actually works really really well what I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.209 
actually works really really well what I
did<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.680> made<00:01:05.609> a<00:01:05.639> little<00:01:05.939> bracket<00:01:07.069> and<00:01:08.069> this

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
did was I made a little bracket and this

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.639 
did was I made a little bracket and this
gets<00:01:08.429> sandwiched<00:01:08.819> in<00:01:08.999> between<00:01:09.029> the<00:01:09.649> tripod

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
gets sandwiched in between the tripod

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.849 
gets sandwiched in between the tripod
adapter<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.459> the<00:01:11.729> cap<00:01:12.029> just<00:01:15.560> screw<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.709> on

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
adapter and the cap just screw it on

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:24.270 
adapter and the cap just screw it on
like<00:01:17.429> normal<00:01:17.639> with<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.119> plate<00:01:18.359> in<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:18.659> middle

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.650 

and<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:25.580> after<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:26.300> stick<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:28.630> stick<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
and then after that stick the stick the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.930 
and then after that stick the stick the
grip<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.110> just<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.580> regular

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
build video and tighten it down and then

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.690 
build video and tighten it down and then
you've<00:01:40.010> got<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.190> platform<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:41.030> mount<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:41.960> on

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
you've got a platform to mount this on

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.940 
you've got a platform to mount this on
it's<00:01:43.700> got<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> quarter<00:01:44.450> 20<00:01:44.810> threaded<00:01:45.470> insert

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
it's got a quarter 20 threaded insert

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.990 
it's got a quarter 20 threaded insert
down<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.560> only<00:01:48.790> bolt<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:49.970> I

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
down here this is the only bolt that I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
down here this is the only bolt that I
head<00:01:50.180> around<00:01:50.420> I've<00:01:50.810> got<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.050> get<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.200> better

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
head around I've got to get a better

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.330 
head around I've got to get a better
looking<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.250> but<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:54.370> screws<00:01:55.370> on<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:57.340> like

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
looking one but just screws on here like

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.050 
looking one but just screws on here like
that<00:01:59.260> and<00:02:00.490> then<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.670> can<00:02:03.460> attach<00:02:04.460> your<00:02:04.670> phone

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that and then you can attach your phone

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.080 
that and then you can attach your phone
in<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.750> cradle<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.250> got<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.730> GoPro

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
in the cradle so you got the the GoPro

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.600 
in the cradle so you got the the GoPro
in<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.270> front<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.649> phone<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.399> rear

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
in the front and the phone in the rear

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.310 
in the front and the phone in the rear
so<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:11.630> kind<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.900> use<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.170> as<00:02:12.260> a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
so you can kind of use it as a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.710 
so you can kind of use it as a
viewfinder<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:14.300> know<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:14.630> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
viewfinder you know you have to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.420 
viewfinder you know you have to
recognize<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.470> GoPro<00:02:16.010> app<00:02:16.190> has<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
recognize that the GoPro app has a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.090 
recognize that the GoPro app has a
little<00:02:16.700> bit<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.970> lag<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:18.650> great<00:02:18.890> for

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
little bit of a lag but it's great for

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.770 
little bit of a lag but it's great for
setting<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:19.670> shots<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.300> keeping<00:02:20.720> your

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
setting up shots and keeping your

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.590 
setting up shots and keeping your
hands-free

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
hands-free

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
hands-free
it<00:02:23.600> makes<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.230> whole<00:02:24.740> rig<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.100> little<00:02:25.670> bit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
