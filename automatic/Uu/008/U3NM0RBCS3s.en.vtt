um efforts going to be able to start

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.110 
um efforts going to be able to start
producing<00:00:01.620> mutant<00:00:02.129> now<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.460> if<00:00:02.520> it<00:00:02.639> becomes<00:00:02.939> a

producing mutant now and if it becomes a

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.789 
producing mutant now and if it becomes a
micro<00:00:03.480> battle<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:03.990> could<00:00:04.140> be<00:00:04.290> trouble<00:00:04.529> for

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
micro battle this could be trouble for

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.460 
micro battle this could be trouble for
men<00:00:04.980> saw<00:00:05.190> actually<00:00:05.670> now<00:00:05.850> menthol<00:00:06.270> has<00:00:06.470> decided

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
men saw actually now menthol has decided

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.690 
men saw actually now menthol has decided
to<00:00:07.500> go<00:00:07.649> ahead<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.890> start<00:00:08.069> harvesting<00:00:08.280> from

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
to go ahead and start harvesting from

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.060 
to go ahead and start harvesting from
that<00:00:08.910> expansion<00:00:09.420> from<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> mineral<00:00:10.740> part<00:00:10.950> of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
that expansion from the mineral part of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459 
that expansion from the mineral part of
his<00:00:11.190> expansion<00:00:11.580> anyways<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.509> producing<00:00:13.469> more

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
his expansion anyways and producing more

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.910 
his expansion anyways and producing more
muta<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.480> both<00:00:15.480> players<00:00:15.960> look<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> being<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
muta so both players look to being a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.529 
muta so both players look to being a
pretty<00:00:17.220> similar<00:00:17.730> position<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.510> now

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
pretty similar position right now

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
pretty similar position right now
actually<00:00:19.260> almost<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:20.070> ever<00:00:20.279> its<00:00:20.460> position

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
actually almost like ever its position

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.160 
actually almost like ever its position
better<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.840> fact<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
better just because of the fact that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
better just because of the fact that
he's<00:00:22.350> already<00:00:22.560> got<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.100> his<00:00:23.220> air<00:00:23.760> defense

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
he's already got all of his air defense

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.679 
he's already got all of his air defense
up<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:25.019> his<00:00:25.140> base<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.180> menthol<00:00:27.180> obviously

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
up it's at his base so menthol obviously

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.200 
up it's at his base so menthol obviously
no<00:00:27.900> no<00:00:28.349> anti<00:00:28.740> air<00:00:28.980> although<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.820> looks<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.119> he

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
no no anti air although it looks like he

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
no no anti air although it looks like he
does<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> pretty<00:00:30.960> sizable<00:00:31.650> force<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
does have a pretty sizable force of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
does have a pretty sizable force of
mutant<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:32.489> those<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.880> multiplied<00:00:33.390> really

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
mutant now those have multiplied really

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
mutant now those have multiplied really
quickly<00:00:34.350> looks<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.130> he's<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.670> 12

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
quickly looks like he's got about 12

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.010 
quickly looks like he's got about 12
probably<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> full<00:00:37.140> control<00:00:37.440> group<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> muta

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
probably a full control group of muta

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
probably a full control group of muta
where<00:00:40.020> effort<00:00:40.320> has<00:00:41.450> 24<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.739> five

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
where effort has 24 I don't know five

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
where effort has 24 I don't know five
muta<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.879> Menzel<00:00:45.239> does<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> large<00:00:46.289> air

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
muta out so Menzel does have a large air

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010 
muta out so Menzel does have a large air
advantage<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:48.989> not

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
advantage right now but I'm not

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.360 
advantage right now but I'm not
convinced<00:00:49.320> efforts<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.340> able

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
convinced efforts not going to be able

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.060 
convinced efforts not going to be able
to<00:00:50.640> produce<00:00:51.800> pretty<00:00:52.800> close<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.430> many<00:00:53.579> muta

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
to produce pretty close to as many muta

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.470 
to produce pretty close to as many muta
at<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.280> point<00:00:56.550> especially<00:00:56.730> again<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
at this point especially again with that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
at this point especially again with that
defense<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.170> he<00:00:58.260> wants<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> sit<00:00:58.800> back<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.039> just

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
defense if he wants to sit back and just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
defense if he wants to sit back and just
build<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.780> seems<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> might<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
build up it seems like that might be a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.640 
build up it seems like that might be a
smart<00:01:02.010> play<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.520> point<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.750> let<00:01:04.379> mints

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
smart play at this point what let mints

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.100 
smart play at this point what let mints
all<00:01:04.799> come<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> him<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.110> uses

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all come to him a little bit and uses

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.429 
all come to him a little bit and uses
his<00:01:07.470> defense<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.070> his<00:01:08.189> advantage<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:10.290> again

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
his defense to his advantage then again

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
his defense to his advantage then again
again<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.729> not<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> pro

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
again what do I know I'm not the pro

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
again what do I know I'm not the pro
here<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.659> i<00:01:12.689> guess<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.140> may<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.590> better<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> keep

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
here so i guess it may be better to keep

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.200 
here so i guess it may be better to keep
men<00:01:14.369> salon<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> defense<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.780> he<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:17.210> again

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
men salon on the defense if he can again

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
men salon on the defense if he can again
men<00:01:18.750> cells<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.619> upgrade<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.369> his<00:01:20.460> muta<00:01:20.820> an

men cells got one upgrade to his muta an

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.149 
men cells got one upgrade to his muta an
armor<00:01:21.450> upgrade<00:01:21.840> already<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> glaive

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
armor upgrade already so the glaive

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.770 
armor upgrade already so the glaive

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this point is going to take out that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.959 
this point is going to take out that
sport<00:02:00.930> colony<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> efforts<00:02:01.890> pulling<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
sport colony and efforts pulling is the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
sport colony and efforts pulling is the
rest<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.390> what's<00:02:03.659> left<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> his<00:02:04.200> Air<00:02:04.380> Force<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
rest that what's left of his Air Force I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
rest that what's left of his Air Force I
guess<00:02:05.009> back<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.969> his<00:02:06.119> main<00:02:06.390> he's<00:02:06.930> basically

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
guess back to his main he's basically

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.990 
guess back to his main he's basically
letting<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.670> guess<00:02:08.849> we're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
letting this go and I guess we're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
letting this go and I guess we're
probably<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> GG<00:02:10.020> from<00:02:10.200> effort

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
probably going to see a GG from effort

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.580 
probably going to see a GG from effort
here<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
here and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.940 
here and
miracle<00:02:12.489> happens<00:02:12.910> because<00:02:13.319> menthols<00:02:14.319> now

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
miracle happens because menthols now

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that first sport colony and he's also

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.070 
that first sport colony and he's also
almost<00:02:21.519> taken<00:02:21.970> out<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> evo<00:02:22.480> chamber<00:02:22.870> he's

almost taken out the evo chamber he's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.259 
almost taken out the evo chamber he's
just<00:02:23.290> deciding<00:02:23.890> he<00:02:24.190> can't<00:02:24.610> even<00:02:24.790> decide<00:02:25.060> what

going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.379> fall<00:02:35.620> here<00:02:36.150> he's<00:02:37.150> trying<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.480> do<00:02:37.660> a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
going to fall here he's trying to do a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.600 
going to fall here he's trying to do a
little<00:02:37.900> harassment<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.560> his<00:02:38.709> own<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.190> men<00:02:39.430> saw

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
little harassment of his own but men saw

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.729 
little harassment of his own but men saw
another<00:02:39.940> five<00:02:40.330> meters<00:02:40.840> six<00:02:41.110> meters<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.620> is

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
another five meters six meters that is

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.370 
another five meters six meters that is
based<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.340> defend<00:02:42.940> against<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.390> year<00:02:43.720> plus

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
based to defend against this year plus

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.440 
based to defend against this year plus
the<00:02:44.590> armor<00:02:44.890> upgrade<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.880> going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.239> too

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
the armor upgrade it's going to be too

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.300 
the armor upgrade it's going to be too
much<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.690> effort<00:02:47.170> here<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.620> I'm<00:02:47.739> gonna<00:02:47.860> expect

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
much for effort here so I'm gonna expect

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.910 
much for effort here so I'm gonna expect
to<00:02:48.430> see<00:02:48.579> a<00:02:48.610> GG<00:02:49.090> from<00:02:49.269> effort<00:02:49.660> shortly<00:02:50.110> he<00:02:50.709> does

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
to see a GG from effort shortly he does

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.339 
to see a GG from effort shortly he does
have<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.549> punches<00:02:52.209> for<00:02:52.450> colonies<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:53.110> up<00:02:53.230> at

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
have a punches for colonies going up at

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.460 
have a punches for colonies going up at
his<00:02:53.440> main<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:54.280> we'll<00:02:54.849> see<00:02:55.060> we'll<00:02:55.750> see<00:02:55.780> how<00:02:56.110> men

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
his main but we'll see we'll see how men

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.619 
his main but we'll see we'll see how men
cells<00:02:56.709> Nita's<00:02:57.280> fare<00:02:57.519> against<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.940> here<00:03:00.629> and

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
cells Nita's fare against this here and

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.819 
cells Nita's fare against this here and
it<00:03:01.750> looks<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.989> they<00:03:02.140> make<00:03:02.319> quick<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.560> of

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
it looks like they make quick work of

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.650 
it looks like they make quick work of
the<00:03:02.950> first<00:03:03.280> spore<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.000> he's<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:04.269> gonna<00:03:04.420> want

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
the first spore but he's not gonna want

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.360 
the first spore but he's not gonna want
to<00:03:04.750> go<00:03:04.900> he's<00:03:05.650> not<00:03:05.860> going<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.099> want<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.310> go

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
to go he's not going to want to go

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.309 
to go he's not going to want to go
against<00:03:07.090> three<00:03:07.329> spores<00:03:07.629> at<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> same<00:03:08.079> time

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
against three spores at the same time

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.229 
against three spores at the same time
here<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.650> men<00:03:09.549> cells<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.879> to<00:03:09.970> pull<00:03:10.209> out

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
here so men cells going to pull out

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.210 
here so men cells going to pull out
until<00:03:10.720> he<00:03:10.810> brings<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.260> rest<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.650> his<00:03:11.709> muta<00:03:12.069> in

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
until he brings the rest of his muta in

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.640 
until he brings the rest of his muta in
and<00:03:12.400> now<00:03:12.549> you'll<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.750> take<00:03:14.349> off<00:03:14.500> these

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
and now you'll want to take off these

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.949 
and now you'll want to take off these
four<00:03:14.890> colonies<00:03:15.310> one<00:03:15.519> at<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.730> time<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.299> efforts

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
four colonies one at a time and efforts

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.360 
four colonies one at a time and efforts
not<00:03:17.079> going<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.350> have<00:03:17.470> anything<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:18.160> defend

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
not going to have anything to defend

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.520 
not going to have anything to defend
here<00:03:18.850> he's<00:03:19.450> gonna<00:03:19.600> throw<00:03:19.900> some<00:03:20.079> zerglings

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
here he's gonna throw some zerglings

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.870 
here he's gonna throw some zerglings
over<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:20.920> just<00:03:21.100> for<00:03:21.220> good<00:03:21.370> measure<00:03:21.430> but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
over there just for good measure but

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.530 
over there just for good measure but
it's<00:03:22.030> gonna<00:03:22.239> make<00:03:22.480> absolutely<00:03:23.049> no<00:03:23.170> difference

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
it's gonna make absolutely no difference

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.729 
it's gonna make absolutely no difference
it's<00:03:25.540> all<00:03:25.720> has<00:03:25.810> more<00:03:26.049> than<00:03:26.139> enough<00:03:26.200> at<00:03:26.620> his
