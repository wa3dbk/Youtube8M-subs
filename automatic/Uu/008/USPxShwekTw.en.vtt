hi I'm Rex from polar parts Orlando and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.039 
hi I'm Rex from polar parts Orlando and
about<00:00:10.759> how<00:00:11.150> to<00:00:11.210> pick<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.480> right<00:00:11.509> shot<00:00:11.840> for

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
about how to pick the right shot for

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.799 
about how to pick the right shot for
your<00:00:12.139> vehicle<00:00:12.519> if<00:00:13.519> your<00:00:13.670> vehicle<00:00:14.030> is<00:00:14.240> lighter

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
your vehicle if your vehicle is lighter

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.880 
your vehicle if your vehicle is lighter
weight<00:00:15.049> such<00:00:15.530> as<00:00:15.769> AG<00:00:16.160> mini<00:00:17.150> truck<00:00:17.710> came<00:00:18.710> with

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
weight such as AG mini truck came with

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.830 
weight such as AG mini truck came with
hydraulic<00:00:19.759> shocks<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.060> begin<00:00:20.270> with<00:00:20.419> the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
hydraulic shocks to begin with the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.800 
hydraulic shocks to begin with the
pro/con<00:00:21.349> 3000<00:00:22.009> is<00:00:22.099> fantastic<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:23.240> is<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.539> 10

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
pro/con 3000 is fantastic it is a 10

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.300 
pro/con 3000 is fantastic it is a 10
stage<00:00:24.050> velocity-sensitive<00:00:24.619> valve<00:00:25.009> shock

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
stage velocity-sensitive valve shock

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.359 
stage velocity-sensitive valve shock
which<00:00:25.849> means<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:26.419> automatically<00:00:27.290> adjusts<00:00:27.829> its

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
which means it automatically adjusts its

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.130 
which means it automatically adjusts its
dampening<00:00:28.969> based<00:00:29.599> on<00:00:29.869> load<00:00:30.619> if<00:00:31.579> it's<00:00:31.790> the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
dampening based on load if it's the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.660 
dampening based on load if it's the
heavier<00:00:33.140> vehicle<00:00:33.530> where<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:33.980> have<00:00:34.280> maybe<00:00:34.520> a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
heavier vehicle where you have maybe a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.450 
heavier vehicle where you have maybe a
3/4<00:00:35.210> ton<00:00:35.360> truck<00:00:35.829> factory<00:00:36.829> truck<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.280> came

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
3/4 ton truck factory truck that came

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.270 
3/4 ton truck factory truck that came
with<00:00:37.700> nitrogen<00:00:38.450> charged<00:00:38.690> shocks<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.500> 9000

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
with nitrogen charged shocks the 9000

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.279 
with nitrogen charged shocks the 9000
series<00:00:40.430> shock<00:00:40.789> would<00:00:41.270> be<00:00:41.480> perfect<00:00:42.110> for<00:00:42.200> your

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
series shock would be perfect for your

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.890 
series shock would be perfect for your
vehicle<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.400> also<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.910> 10<00:00:44.300> stage<00:00:44.510> velocity

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
vehicle it also is 10 stage velocity

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.080 
vehicle it also is 10 stage velocity
sensitive<00:00:45.290> valve<00:00:45.579> but<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:46.700> is<00:00:46.760> also

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
sensitive valve but it is also

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.290 
sensitive valve but it is also
pressurized<00:00:47.840> which<00:00:48.079> means<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.590> will<00:00:49.300> push

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
pressurized which means it will push

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.050 
pressurized which means it will push
back<00:00:50.570> against<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.050> suspension<00:00:51.560> to<00:00:52.160> give<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:52.970> a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
back against the suspension to give it a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.370 
back against the suspension to give it a
little<00:00:53.210> firmer<00:00:53.540> ride<00:00:53.810> a<00:00:54.050> little<00:00:54.170> better

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
little firmer ride a little better

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.760 
little firmer ride a little better
control<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.579> next<00:00:55.880> step<00:00:56.270> up<00:00:56.450> is<00:00:56.770> an

adjustable<00:00:58.280> shock<00:00:58.550> such<00:00:58.970> as<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.480> MX<00:01:00.260> 6<00:01:00.560> which

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
adjustable shock such as the MX 6 which

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.979 
adjustable shock such as the MX 6 which
has<00:01:01.370> six<00:01:01.940> different<00:01:02.120> points<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.570> adjustment

way to extremely firm which means you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.590 
way to extremely firm which means you

a reservoir the dampening characters are

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.660 
a reservoir the dampening characters are
the<00:01:20.720> same<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.590> have<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> reservoir<00:01:22.370> with

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the same but you have a reservoir with

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.630 
the same but you have a reservoir with
additional<00:01:23.090> oil<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:24.080> give<00:01:25.010> it<00:01:25.040> better<00:01:25.340> cooling

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
additional oil to give it better cooling

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.149 
additional oil to give it better cooling
and<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.540> also<00:01:26.690> looks<00:01:27.110> extremely<00:01:27.470> trekking<00:01:28.070> and
