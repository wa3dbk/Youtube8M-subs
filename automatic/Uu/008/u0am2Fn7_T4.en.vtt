00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.840
 vertebra door scale opens 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 the trigger starts that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.440
 Why only with I put I understand on the board 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.440
 the beach 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:45.090
 good afternoon my dear young craftsmen 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:50.370
 hello friends and it looks like order 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 what kind of rubbish is it not rubbish friends is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.070
 very useful ornamental material you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.510
 even broken clothespins are now all 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.430
 learn let's start our lesson 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.380
 so today we will work with you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 waste material that is with the fact that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 usually throw away and broken clothespins 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 and plastic cup used 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.140
 These are but we are now 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.030
 craftsmen truth and we can find the unusual 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.030
 application even for seemingly quite 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 not exactly the right things we can of course 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.630
 if we make a stand out of it 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240
 for pencils 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.520
 we will also need a two-way 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.299
 duct tape 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 napkin tassel glass with water 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.920
 scissors gouache paint and bright 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 ribbon 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.750
 let's start now with the fact that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.799
 paint the halves of wooden clothespins 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.360
 bright colored paints that he all 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.340
 we will paint 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.439
 no, first we calculate how much 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.040
 half to we will need and then them 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.040
 let's color 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.350
 the concept of a cup we will paste over 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.420
 pegs halves up tooth 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.770
 and the more diverse and brighter the colors will be 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.770
 the more interesting it will turn out our crafts 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:00.530
 so 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:04.790
 ready and they are not similar to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.290
 garbage is just the same for no reason 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.819
 Now let's do the preparation of the basics and 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.440
 the tip of the tour is exactly 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.239
 and how will we prepare it for us 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.070
 need to glue the outer surface 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.070
 cup double sided tape 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.860
 neatly glue it in a circle 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:39.050
 near the rim 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:48.590
 cut off the excess side by side 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:51.260
 one more strip and I already figured it out 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.480
 then we will sing and stick our 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.209
 colorful clothespins 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.769
 quite right now remove the protective 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:07.910
 there is no film from our adhesive tape 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.860
 trying after all this is not easy tape very 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.030
 sticky 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.370
 but that means ours well 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.370
 the halves of the pegs hold tight 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:34.010
 now gently holding a cup 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.930
 for the edge and bottom one by one we put 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.960
 its surfaces are halves of clothespins and 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.900
 press harder and which side 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.350
 attach clothespins 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.940
 put a smoother side 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:53.020
 cup surface alternate colors 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.440
 can proceed from your imagination 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.280
 glue so that the bottom was tight 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.280
 not very upstairs 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.530
 it turns out well, that's the whole surface 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.650
 cup closed 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:21.480
 Now you need as tight as possible to press 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:30.990
 our halves of clothespins to the cup here 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:34.410
 so see what we got left 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:39.680
 tie the last touch around 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:43.250
 our pencil stand here 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.250
 where is the groove 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.670
 all is ready 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.930
 I would think what kind of garbage 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.990
 the beauty will and no doubt 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.509
 I also did not doubt this stand yet 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.360
 and how I use the vase 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.719
 Well, of course you can come up with a variety 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.719
 applications for our craft on now 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.620
 it's time to say goodbye to the guys before 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.610
 new meetings 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.610
 shishkin and school
