00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.080
It’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.319
Today, we are going to show you how to change
the water line on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:06.899
It’s a really easy job.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.640
All we are going to need is a 5/16ths nut
driver, a pair of slip joint pliers and a

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.980
sharp utility knife.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.189
You should pick yourself up a 5/16ths union
as well.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.789
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.340
Now to do this repair, we will need to access
the back of refrigerator.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.480
So we are going to have to pull it away from
the wall, disconnect the power and turn off

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.869
the water supply and disconnect it from the
back of the water route.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.630
Now with the back panel removed here and the
water line disconnected, so next we are going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:42.090
to remove the 5/16ths screw that holds that
water valve to the side of the cabinet.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:55.570
We will pull that valve out and we can get
out it.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.960
Disconnect the wire harness from the feeding
tube, gain a little more access.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.720
Now your valve may have the thread-on type
connectors such as this one does or may be

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720
the push-on style.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.690
Either way disconnect the 5/16ths one, then
make a little water come into that valve.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.630
We can set that aside now and if yours has
the thread-on connector, you can actually

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.930
pull that off of the tubing.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.270
Now typically this tubing cracks from heat
from the compressor tubing, so it is either

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.240
going to be cracked in this area here or right
in this area.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.860
So we have got enough good tubing where it
enters the refrigerator, we will just cut

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.740
it there and we will put our union in that
position.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.150
We will put it in that position.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.460
Now if the tubing is dried, it would crack
right up through to the floor and actually

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.670
put the union inside the refrigerator compartment.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.680
We just removed the two bottom crispers and
the reservoir being that area, we will just

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.760
cut it there and put the union in that spot.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.180
So with a sharp utility knife, we are just
going to cut that tubing and to make sure

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.140
that we had a nice straight cut.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:47.740
Now we have cut that tubing, we need to make
sure that we have a nice straight cut-out.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.840
So pull any excess on through the hole that
you can get and taking knife with a block

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.840
of wood, make a nice straight cut.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.209
Now before we pull this tubing out of the
way, thread it underneath the machine compartment

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.100
here in a rather tight channel.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.070
So it is best if you can connect the new tubing
to the old tubing.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.630
What I have done is taking the rather large
self-tapping screw and I have cut it to about

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.770
an inch in length.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.680
You could probably use a three-and-a-half
inch nail, something like that and cut the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.630
tube about an inch in length and slide one
end into one of the tubing and take the new

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.491
tubing, slide it on to the other end.

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:42.680
And then we will take the two pieces together
with a little bit of electrical tape, the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.739
metal screw just provides a little support
at that joint so that it doesn’t flex.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.390
Now we can feed that tubing through.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:03.830
You can pull on one side and push in the other,
until we pulled it through and we will unravel

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.700
our tape.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.120
We can discard the old tubing.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.449
We will position the new water tubing, so
that it is not going to be against the refrigeration

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.419
tubing where it can gain some heat and just
caution when working around that tubing, because

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.520
it is fragile enough that we don’t want
to kink it.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.370
We will position it so that it is enough when
you touch it.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.100
And then we can install the union.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:48.569
So we will slide the nut on to each side and
will push the tubing right until the bottom

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:58.310
is out in the union and then we will tighten
that nut.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:27.830
Same on the opposite end and we will tighten
both of those nuts securely, so that we don’t

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:36.379
get any leaks.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:54.270
Next, we will need to determine what length
that we need to cut that tubing off and then

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.620
using a sharp utility knife blade and a block
of wood, so that we protect our floor.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:11.169
We will just make a nice straight cut down
through that tubing and discard the old tubing.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:20.949
Next, we will install the compression nut
on the end of that new portion of tubing.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:30.439
Make sure we leave lots of it protruding,
so that we can insert it into the valve and

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:37.909
use the bottom out completely.

00:06:37.909 --> 00:07:02.409
Now tighten that nut just a little extra with
the pliers and reconnect the wire harness

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:09.229
and then reposition the valve and mount it
to the side of the cabinet, with the tab in

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:32.759
the locating hole and reinstall that 5/16ths
Hex head screw.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:41.379
Now make sure that the tubing is not binding
up against anything or leaning up against

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:43.710
the refrigeration tubing.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.800
We are ready to reinstall the back panel and
reconnect the inlet water supply.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.870
I told you it was an easy job.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.229
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
