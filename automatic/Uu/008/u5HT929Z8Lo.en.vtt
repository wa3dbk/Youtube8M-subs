00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
will say take the Strand on the right

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.510 
will say take the Strand on the right
lay<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> over<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:49.050> toward<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> left<00:00:49.860> like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
lay it over the top toward the left like

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.529 
lay it over the top toward the left like
so<00:00:51.379> then<00:00:52.379> take<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so then take your right one to take it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.650 
so then take your right one to take it
over<00:00:55.160> around<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> back<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> through<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
over around the back and through the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.950 
over around the back and through the
loop<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.879> tie<00:01:00.120> those<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.690> nice

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
loop and then just tie those down nice

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.370 
loop and then just tie those down nice
and<00:01:00.989> tight<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:07.409> there's<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.770> starting<00:01:08.189> loop

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
and tight and there's your starting loop

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
and tight and there's your starting loop
and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> front<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.640> where

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and then right in the front there where

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.170 
and then right in the front there where
you<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.810> ear<00:01:13.350> over<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.180> if

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you see you have your ear over and if

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.340 
you see you have your ear over and if
you<00:01:15.270> flip<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you flip it over you have one on the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.820 
you flip it over you have one on the
back<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:18.470> take<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.799> side<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:21.830> over

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
back to take the right side again over

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
back to take the right side again over
the<00:01:22.950> front<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.610> take<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.090> left<00:01:24.479> side

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the front and then take your left side

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
the front and then take your left side
put<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> over<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.710> through<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> loop<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
put it over that through the loop on the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.109 
put it over that through the loop on the
back<00:01:27.270> again<00:01:28.189> tighten<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.000> then

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
back again tighten that off and then

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.880 
back again tighten that off and then
give<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.479> tug<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.640> then<00:01:32.640> stick<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
give it a tug and then stick with that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
give it a tug and then stick with that
take<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> right<00:01:35.189> side<00:01:35.460> again<00:01:35.790> put<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> over

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
take the right side again put it over

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.700 
take the right side again put it over
around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:38.540> through<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
around the back through you have to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.819 
around the back through you have to
adjust<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.750> comes<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.229> looking<00:01:43.500> normal

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
adjust it so it comes out looking normal

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.050 
adjust it so it comes out looking normal
because<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> being<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.520> angle<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because of it being on an angle it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.859 
because of it being on an angle it
doesn't<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.470> tight<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> should<00:01:50.869> but

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
doesn't get as tight as it should but

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
doesn't get as tight as it should but
you<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.170> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> flip<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> around<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.220> all

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you don't want to flip it around at all

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.660 
you don't want to flip it around at all
you<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.119> keep<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:54.960> way

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
you just want to keep going the same way

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
you just want to keep going the same way
the<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the right side again it's not going to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.120 
the right side again it's not going to
be<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> left<00:01:59.460> side<00:01:59.700> ever<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.130> right

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
be the left side ever for this right

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.690 
be the left side ever for this right
side<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.799> repeat<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.430> process

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
side again and just repeat this process

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.260 
side again and just repeat this process
until<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:08.520> run<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.910> cord

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
until you run out of cord

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.800 
until you run out of cord
just<00:02:10.780> keep<00:02:10.960> doing<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.380> right<00:02:11.530> side<00:02:15.510> I'll<00:02:16.510> just

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
just keep doing the right side I'll just

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.160 
just keep doing the right side I'll just
finish<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.290> whole<00:02:17.440> thing<00:02:18.420> better<00:02:19.420> final<00:02:19.960> I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
finish the whole thing better final I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380 
finish the whole thing better final I
slow<00:02:20.620> down<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.860> guess<00:02:21.070> when<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.520> talk<00:02:21.850> not

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
slow down I guess when I talk not

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.270 
slow down I guess when I talk not
necessarily<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:26.440> wasn't<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.860> whole<00:02:27.040> five

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
necessarily but this wasn't a whole five

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.520 
necessarily but this wasn't a whole five
feet<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.480> use<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> five<00:02:29.050> foot<00:02:29.290> length

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
feet so if you use a five foot length
