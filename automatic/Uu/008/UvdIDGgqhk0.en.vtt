there's<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.790> lot<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.030> folio<00:02:13.510> cases<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.200> cover

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
there's a lot of folio cases that cover

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.370 
there's a lot of folio cases that cover
the<00:02:14.650> bezel<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> don't<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.140> because

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
the bezel but I don't like that because

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.320 
the bezel but I don't like that because
when<00:02:17.950> you're<00:02:18.100> using<00:02:18.280> leather<00:02:18.610> leather<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
when you're using leather leather is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.950 
when you're using leather leather is
very<00:02:19.390> firm<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.740> lot<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.100> times<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
very firm so a lot of times the the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.430 
very firm so a lot of times the the
cover<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.650> bezel<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.490> never<00:02:25.390> flush<00:02:25.930> with

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
cover for the bezel is never flush with

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.260 
cover for the bezel is never flush with
the<00:02:26.470> actual<00:02:26.860> screen<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.880> you're<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.210> to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
the actual screen so you're going to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.470 
the actual screen so you're going to
find<00:02:28.510> little<00:02:28.900> gaps<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:30.550> some<00:02:30.760> people<00:02:31.060> this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
find little gaps and to some people this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.960 
find little gaps and to some people this
might<00:02:31.660> not<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.990> problem<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.800> me<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.250> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
might not be a problem but to me it is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.680 
might not be a problem but to me it is
because<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> dog<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.240> fur<00:02:37.240> goes<00:02:37.480> in

case is that it actually has a stand and
there's<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.390> lot<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.630> cases<00:02:59.080> with<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.590> similar

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
there's a lot of cases with this similar

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.460 
there's a lot of cases with this similar
style<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> how<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.330> works<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.020> pop<00:03:02.260> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
style and how this works is you pop it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.460 
style and how this works is you pop it
out<00:03:02.590> with<00:03:02.830> these<00:03:02.980> corners<00:03:04.050> let's<00:03:05.050> try<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> get

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
out with these corners let's try to get

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
out with these corners let's try to get
it<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:08.550> once<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:09.700> popped

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
it out here and then once it's popped

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.780 
it out here and then once it's popped
out<00:03:10.210> you<00:03:10.780> pull<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.380> up<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.920> then<00:03:12.460> if<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.670> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
out you pull it up and then if you can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
out you pull it up and then if you can
see<00:03:13.060> here<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:14.080> kind<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.410> pull<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:16.270> ipad<00:03:16.570> like

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
see here you kind of pull the ipad like

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.260 
see here you kind of pull the ipad like
this<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.160> part<00:03:18.370> over<00:03:18.550> here<00:03:18.910> bends

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
this and then this part over here bends

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.680 
this and then this part over here bends
and<00:03:20.520> then<00:03:21.520> here<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.850> go<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.060> stick<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.600> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
and then here you go you stick it in the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.120 
and then here you go you stick it in the
notches<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.290> that's<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> notches<00:03:23.860> are

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
notches and that's what the notches are

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.030 
notches and that's what the notches are
for<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.360> angle<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.890> have<00:03:27.010> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
for so you have this angle you have a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.610 
for so you have this angle you have a
little<00:03:27.370> lower<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:28.000> then<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.050> have<00:03:29.320> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
little lower and then you have the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
little lower and then you have the
typing<00:03:30.040> angle<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:31.239> when<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.600> type<00:03:31.959> um<00:03:32.640> it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
typing angle now when you type um it

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.400 
typing angle now when you type um it
does<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.090> little<00:03:34.209> give<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.810> that's<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
does have a little give and that's the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.960 
does have a little give and that's the
leather<00:03:35.620> because<00:03:36.040> right<00:03:36.310> now<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.610> not<00:03:36.670> being

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
leather because right now it's not being

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.930 
leather because right now it's not being
supported<00:03:37.360> by<00:03:37.390> notch<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.370> fold<00:03:39.790> of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
supported by notch it's on the fold of

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.199 
supported by notch it's on the fold of
the<00:03:40.000> leather<00:03:40.239> itself<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.880> when<00:03:42.880> I<00:03:42.910> actually

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
the leather itself but when I actually

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.860 
the leather itself but when I actually
use<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:45.580> type<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.209> I'm<00:03:46.450> going<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.660> try<00:03:46.840> to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
use it to type and I'm going to try to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.890 
use it to type and I'm going to try to
do<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.110> quick<00:03:47.290> demo<00:03:48.090> let's<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.360> this<00:03:49.570> in

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
do a quick demo let's get this in

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.040 
do a quick demo let's get this in
landscape<00:03:50.830> mode

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.650 

come<00:03:57.050> on<00:03:58.090> here<00:03:59.090> we<00:03:59.210> go<00:03:59.390> so<00:04:01.150> when<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.240> do<00:04:02.420> it

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
come on here we go so when you do it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:14.340 
come on here we go so when you do it
it's<00:04:03.380> not<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.560> bad

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.810 

and<00:04:15.350> it's<00:04:16.160> pretty<00:04:16.400> good<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:19.340> that's<00:04:19.670> a

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
and it's pretty good and so that's a

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.490 
and it's pretty good and so that's a
very<00:04:20.000> typical<00:04:20.180> style<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.840> cases<00:04:21.170> it's<00:04:21.320> very

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
very typical style of cases it's very

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.740 
very typical style of cases it's very
popular<00:04:21.800> online<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.090> there<00:04:23.240> are<00:04:23.390> several

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.460 
this similar style of stand and case are
you<00:04:31.850> bow<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.570> while<00:04:34.720> scroll<00:04:35.720> Shore<00:04:36.110> something

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
you bow a while scroll Shore something

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.620 
you bow a while scroll Shore something
like<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:38.090> yeah<00:04:38.210> it's<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.450> very

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
like that and so yeah it's a very

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.750 
like that and so yeah it's a very
popular<00:04:38.900> style<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.770> reason<00:04:39.950> why<00:04:40.310> I

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
popular style but the reason why I

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.630 
popular style but the reason why I
bought<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.840> bar<00:04:42.080> where<00:04:42.350> one<00:04:42.590> is<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:43.220> one<00:04:43.400> it's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
bought the bar where one is for one it's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.490 
bought the bar where one is for one it's
available<00:04:43.940> at<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> apple<00:04:44.600> store<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.080> if<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.290> had

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
available at the apple store so if I had

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.950 
available at the apple store so if I had
any<00:04:45.710> problem<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.160> can<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.460> return<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.150> to

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
any problem I can just return it and to

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.890 
any problem I can just return it and to
a<00:04:48.260> lot<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.800> cases<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:50.150> notch<00:04:50.390> is<00:04:50.420> over

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
a lot of the cases the notch is over

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.550 
a lot of the cases the notch is over
here<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.260> actually<00:04:51.590> really<00:04:52.370> loose<00:04:52.760> so<00:04:53.750> they

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
here I actually really loose so they

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.440 
here I actually really loose so they
don't<00:04:54.770> actually<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.610> ipad<00:04:55.970> doesn't<00:04:56.120> snap

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
don't actually the ipad doesn't snap

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.130 
don't actually the ipad doesn't snap
into<00:04:56.750> them<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.260> kind<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:57.980> rests<00:04:58.430> in<00:04:58.580> there

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
into them it kind of just rests in there

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.690 
into them it kind of just rests in there
and<00:05:00.140> it's<00:05:00.290> just<00:05:00.500> protection<00:05:01.100> but<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.370> this

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
and it's just protection but in this

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.110 
and it's just protection but in this
case<00:05:01.970> it<00:05:02.240> actually<00:05:02.530> clasps<00:05:03.530> in<00:05:03.740> there<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:04.790> I

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
case it actually clasps in there so I

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.370 
case it actually clasps in there so I
can<00:05:05.240> do<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:07.430> as<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.570> can<00:05:08.720> see<00:05:08.750> it's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
can do this and and as you can see it's

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.650 
can do this and and as you can see it's
not<00:05:09.560> falling<00:05:10.010> out<00:05:10.160> from<00:05:10.400> those<00:05:10.670> from<00:05:11.480> these

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
not falling out from those from these

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.730 
not falling out from those from these
notches<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:13.750> yeah<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:14.930> that's<00:05:15.080> also<00:05:15.350> good

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
notches and yeah and that's also good

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.110 
notches and yeah and that's also good
and<00:05:15.920> another<00:05:16.190> thing<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.580> lot<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:16.820> people

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
and another thing is a lot of people

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.580 
and another thing is a lot of people
have<00:05:17.210> concerns<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.780> when<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.170> hold<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.560> like

the cover kind of flaps and that to me
is<00:05:34.550> really<00:05:34.940> irritating<00:05:35.380> but<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.890> all<00:05:37.190> the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
is really irritating but in all the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.160 
is really irritating but in all the
cases<00:05:37.520> leave<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:38.090> loose<00:05:38.270> but<00:05:38.720> with<00:05:38.990> the

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
cases leave it loose but with the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.490 
cases leave it loose but with the
marware<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:40.090> has<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.360> little<00:05:41.420> elastic<00:05:42.050> band

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
marware it has this little elastic band

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.040 
marware it has this little elastic band
right<00:05:42.980> here<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.640> that<00:05:44.240> band<00:05:44.540> just<00:05:44.840> comes

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
right here and that band just comes

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.340 
right here and that band just comes
across<00:05:45.200> like<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:47.270> let<00:05:47.690> me<00:05:47.720> get<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:47.990> around

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
across like this let me get it around

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.400 
across like this let me get it around
and<00:05:49.180> then<00:05:50.180> once<00:05:50.450> you<00:05:51.040> get<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.190> band<00:05:52.430> on<00:05:53.410> now

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
and then once you get the band on now

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.250 
and then once you get the band on now
you<00:05:54.470> can<00:05:55.010> hold<00:05:55.280> this<00:05:55.460> iPad<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.420> the<00:05:57.020> case

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
you can hold this iPad and the case

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.170 
you can hold this iPad and the case
without<00:05:57.530> worrying<00:05:58.340> about<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.850> cover<00:05:59.090> of

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
without worrying about the cover of

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.210 
without worrying about the cover of
flapping<00:05:59.510> and<00:06:00.320> you<00:06:00.530> know<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.740> can<00:06:00.950> stick<00:06:01.190> your

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
flapping and you know you can stick your

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.760 
flapping and you know you can stick your
hand<00:06:01.670> and<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:02.750> think<00:06:03.230> a<00:06:03.350> lot<00:06:03.500> of<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.620> companies

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
hand and I think a lot of the companies

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.040 
hand and I think a lot of the companies
don't<00:06:04.220> even<00:06:04.490> have<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:04.730> hand<00:06:05.090> strap<00:06:05.390> which<00:06:05.720> I'm

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
don't even have the hand strap which I'm

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.410 
don't even have the hand strap which I'm
not<00:06:06.290> going<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.620> use<00:06:06.890> too<00:06:07.130> much<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.790> is<00:06:08.300> an

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
not going to use too much but it is an

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.130 
not going to use too much but it is an
added<00:06:08.720> plus<00:06:09.130> so<00:06:10.210> that<00:06:11.210> being<00:06:11.420> said<00:06:11.540> there<00:06:11.990> are

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
added plus so that being said there are

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.790 
added plus so that being said there are
some<00:06:12.670> things<00:06:13.670> that<00:06:13.850> I<00:06:14.330> could<00:06:14.780> do<00:06:15.230> without<00:06:15.410> in

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
some things that I could do without in

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.010 
some things that I could do without in
this<00:06:15.950> case<00:06:16.160> very<00:06:16.670> minor<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.420> it's<00:06:17.930> really

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
this case very minor and it's really

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.770 
this case very minor and it's really
personal<00:06:18.970> one<00:06:19.970> thing<00:06:20.180> is<00:06:20.360> that<00:06:20.570> when<00:06:20.690> you

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
personal one thing is that when you

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.540 
personal one thing is that when you
clasp<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:21.470> close<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:23.810> just<00:06:24.290> sort<00:06:24.770> of

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
clasp it close it just sort of

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.730 
clasp it close it just sort of
touches<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.879> the<00:06:27.150> frame<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.810> holds<00:06:28.470> it<00:06:28.530> tight

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
touches the the frame and holds it tight

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.589 
touches the the frame and holds it tight
enough<00:06:29.009> that<00:06:29.069> it<00:06:29.340> doesn't<00:06:29.370> open<00:06:29.940> it's<00:06:30.389> not

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
enough that it doesn't open it's not

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.409 
enough that it doesn't open it's not
actually<00:06:31.020> snapping<00:06:31.710> which<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.909> me<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.090> guess

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
actually snapping which to me I guess

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.809 
actually snapping which to me I guess
with<00:06:33.629> time<00:06:33.930> this<00:06:34.289> could<00:06:34.470> loosen<00:06:34.830> up<00:06:35.009> and<00:06:35.190> the

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
with time this could loosen up and the

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.270 
with time this could loosen up and the
cover<00:06:36.090> could<00:06:36.330> open<00:06:36.690> and<00:06:36.870> you<00:06:36.930> can't<00:06:37.229> snap<00:06:38.069> this

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
cover could open and you can't snap this

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.820 
cover could open and you can't snap this
over<00:06:38.639> to<00:06:38.819> hold<00:06:39.030> it<00:06:39.180> in<00:06:39.300> but<00:06:39.840> for<00:06:39.900> now<00:06:40.199> it's<00:06:40.530> fine

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
over to hold it in but for now it's fine

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.520 
over to hold it in but for now it's fine
another<00:06:41.280> concern<00:06:41.669> is<00:06:41.879> that<00:06:41.909> with<00:06:42.720> time<00:06:42.960> these

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
another concern is that with time these

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.920 
another concern is that with time these
can<00:06:44.099> also<00:06:44.280> get<00:06:44.580> loose<00:06:44.849> and<00:06:45.150> I'm<00:06:45.599> concerned

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
can also get loose and I'm concerned

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.469 
can also get loose and I'm concerned
that<00:06:46.080> it<00:06:46.169> will<00:06:46.289> fall<00:06:46.530> out<00:06:46.560> and<00:06:47.060> also<00:06:48.060> this

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
that it will fall out and also this

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.450 
that it will fall out and also this
strap<00:06:48.870> which<00:06:49.500> is<00:06:49.650> one<00:06:49.979> of<00:06:50.009> the<00:06:50.099> reason<00:06:50.310> why<00:06:50.400> I'm

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
strap which is one of the reason why I'm

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.550 
strap which is one of the reason why I'm
not<00:06:50.580> going<00:06:50.759> to<00:06:50.819> use<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:50.970> strap<00:06:51.330> after<00:06:52.199> you<00:06:52.289> use

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
not going to use a strap after you use

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.730 
not going to use a strap after you use
it<00:06:52.590> this<00:06:53.629> elastic<00:06:54.629> might<00:06:54.840> actually<00:06:55.139> get<00:06:55.440> loose

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
it this elastic might actually get loose

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.680 
it this elastic might actually get loose
and<00:06:56.039> then<00:06:56.789> that's<00:06:57.030> going<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.389> wind<00:06:57.569> up

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
and then that's going to wind up

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.480 
and then that's going to wind up
sticking<00:06:57.990> out<00:06:58.289> and<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.830> same<00:06:59.069> with<00:06:59.310> this

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
sticking out and the same with this

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.200 
sticking out and the same with this
piece<00:07:00.000> of<00:07:00.270> elastic<00:07:00.750> which<00:07:01.229> I<00:07:01.349> will<00:07:01.560> use<00:07:02.210> this

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
piece of elastic which I will use this

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.570 
piece of elastic which I will use this
over<00:07:03.690> time<00:07:03.840> could<00:07:04.139> get<00:07:04.319> loose<00:07:04.469> as<00:07:04.680> well<00:07:04.860> so

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
over time could get loose as well so

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.430 
over time could get loose as well so
those<00:07:05.849> are<00:07:05.969> just<00:07:06.090> some<00:07:06.270> concerns<00:07:06.659> of<00:07:06.840> mine<00:07:06.990> but

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
those are just some concerns of mine but

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.180 
those are just some concerns of mine but
for<00:07:07.800> now<00:07:08.009> this<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:08.879> a<00:07:09.169> really<00:07:10.169> really<00:07:10.349> perfect

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
case it has a carbon fiber look to it

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.059
