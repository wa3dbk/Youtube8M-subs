we use the vest in rehab to help again

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.059 
we use the vest in rehab to help again
build<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.450> muscle<00:02:03.810> mass<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.409> dogs<00:02:04.619> often

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
build the muscle mass for dogs often

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.999 
build the muscle mass for dogs often
after<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.670> dog<00:02:05.850> has<00:02:06.060> had<00:02:06.240> an<00:02:06.390> injury<00:02:07.009> it's

again and start building that muscle
mass<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.629> want<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.989> help<00:02:19.200> increase<00:02:19.680> that

mass we want to help increase that

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.759 
mass we want to help increase that
endurance<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.690> them<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.260> will<00:02:22.380> often<00:02:22.739> use

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
endurance in them so we will often use

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.460 
endurance in them so we will often use
the<00:02:23.010> vest<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:24.030> help<00:02:24.299> build<00:02:24.780> more<00:02:25.049> muscle<00:02:25.079> mass
