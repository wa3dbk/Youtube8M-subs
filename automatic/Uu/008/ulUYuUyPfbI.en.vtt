00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 yes hello people in this video I show 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:14.580
 a bluetooth speaker from the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:16.740
 home hd mx much fun speaker comes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.560
 in this chic hard plastic box the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.609
 on the outside two more 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.590
 Metal elements has in scope of delivery 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.740
 located next to the speaker 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.890
 another 3.5 millimeter cable 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 a power adapter around the speaker 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 to charge and different paper slips 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 the design is very loud speaker 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.739
 edged and resembles more of a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.590
 box the speaker consists predominantly 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 hard plastic but which is very good 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 and precisely processed 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 on the front is in 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 black the speaker he goes with it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 the sound can escape well on the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 top is the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 on which we use the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.980
 Speakers on and off 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.489
 make the sound louder and quieter 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 or pause the song or 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 You can skip left and right 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 Then we have two more lights 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.380
 Indicators show how much battery 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.600
 the speaker has and whether we are with 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 What are on the bluetooth connected 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.759
 The top side is the big one 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.720
 the notch serves as the handle 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.850
 extend 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.189
 so we still have the possibility the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 to carry speakers on the way 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.420
 back of the speaker we have 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 two holes of which 1 to air circulation 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 the sound for a better and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.759
 others I thought only as decoration 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.610
 behind two rubber flaps is located 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.310
 to the 1 1 35 millimeter jack connection 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.009
 to the speaker classically too 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
 connect and the other connection is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 intended for loading on the bottom 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.909
 we can fold out an increase 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 so that the speaker is better the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.670
 Rubber on the bottom is used 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.250
 that the hdm ex champ partie also at 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.649
 full volume is still fixed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.619
 the battery comes the speaker 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.659
 at just under ten hours what the size 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 really good if we have the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 connect speakers via bluetooth 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.110
 we just need to go into the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.270
 bluetooth setting 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.370
 your device go and there completely 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.920
 just activate bluetooth and then 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.080
 connect to the speaker and then 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 Now we come to the sound I have 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.740
 the speakers with different 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.780
 music styles tested and me 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.600
 noticed that the heights and minden 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.570
 only the bass is very well balanced 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.400
 I was a bit too strong but on the big side 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.830
 and all he has we really sounded 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.720
 promised before now to Conclusion 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.000
 there is still a small plan 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.010
 test, however, you should note here 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140
 that sound through the microphone is not 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.420
 exactly reproduced 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.440
 and of course he sounded live clearly 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.440
 is better 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.410
 the speaker has one as possible 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.390
 good sound enduring battery and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 by the carrying handle fischer also still 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.280
 very portable 1 is very important to me 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.280
 The camp party disturbed and that the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.200
 external power cord because you are so yes 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.020
 still need an extra cable 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.180
 here would be a micro-usb connection in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.980
 my eyes have been better if you the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.989
 I want to buy loudspeakers 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.180
 check out the links below the description 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.670
 on because you can stop by to look like 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.630
 I thank you for watching until the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.630
 next time bye
