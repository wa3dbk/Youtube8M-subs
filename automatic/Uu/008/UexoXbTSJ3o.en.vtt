00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 I feel that they see what is your going to be the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.849
 best nacho martín possible already passed the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 nacho de valladolid in the sierra in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 Canary Islands that has been left behind were 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.919
 good seasons but good you can not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.019
 live the past so I want to be the 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.519
 better version of myself already bring to the 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.039
 good team is first day and until the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.329
 last good it is clear that we are not a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.759
 high team 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.070
 we are pivots because not very high pulling 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.780
 short but good suffer the lack of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.340
 centimeters with ambition with desire and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.199
 especially with speed and with 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.359
 mobility by putting yourself in example you 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.250
 I would say so are we have is not very tall 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.660
 but yes it is very agile very fast so 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.059
 which I think is a point in favor for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.530
 So, with my father, I see the good 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.230
 the basketball the bad the injuries 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.030
 the good times the defaults the arrangement 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.829
 all good but always good 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.140
 since I was little I saw him train and play and 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.000
 I wanted to be like my father and it's clear 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.890
 well, I 'm on the road that I am 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:12.399
 following and that I started playing for me 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:14.470
 father we still doubt if there is streetball 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.000
 good in madrid I think the best 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.100
 form of madrid 'lavapiés to play 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 street ball to name a couple of 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.360
 my colleagues who play here because lennon 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 i desmond jump just a little bit the most 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.470
 those who have more name here in Madrid 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.670
 and the Spanish park rangers I think that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.890
 it would be the sants park in barcelona 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.530
 which is where we all play 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.750
 summers and there are many people who 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 they go every weekend even between 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.470
 week to the park to play so it's 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.539
 The best track in Spain is the park of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.520
 sant a rapper so it's coming out 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.649
 although it is starting and that is young 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.890
 how can it be, because juancho jaime or 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.869
 ander i would say to draw calero that is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.510
 musician of coslada who is also a colleague 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.490
 mine and also 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.780
 jobs and would come to compare a little 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.640
 with people like hernán gómez who has 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.950
 a lot of talent but they are starting little 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.440
 I have a lot because I have many 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.320
 slippers I have my own collection myself 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.300
 I think I 'm already going through 130 pairs 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.890
 even more than 100 reais of 130 pairs 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.470
 of sneakers and then I have my own 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.690
 shop my online business that also from 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.610
 client and peak pairs so that in my 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.100
 house can be put together much 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.960
 shoe and it's what I tell you is I'm 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 collector and apart I have the store 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.610
 which is a crazy shoe 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.610
 From home
