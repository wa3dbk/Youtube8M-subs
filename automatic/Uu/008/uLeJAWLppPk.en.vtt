00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 would like to tell you something today from a really great new book with the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.539

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.509

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.870
 and in this cookbook 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.880
 There are a hundred and fifty simple in the shell inspired recipes and 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.000
 when you open the book as they really have a great story 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.730
 get first an overview of the basics of the Tagus who there 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.320
 Percent the 3 thirsty cars and the life energy Ben 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.040
 At the beginning I had no idea what it is then just about a little bit over 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 Diageo will be in several 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.810

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.640

 according to its own pen, medicine and Emil dunkt year 1 food at the same time 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 also remedies 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.040
 In order to learn a lot, they believe me to be the basis of AUA going to Chen 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.110
 Philosophy is the doctrine of the five elements 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.830

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.860
 Kappa 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.160
 the explanation is also very detailed in the CS 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.840
 book 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.950
 At the moment in the beginning I believe them it is of course trying barrage 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.100
 but if they have read the book 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.660
 what you know 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.079
 as concrete that all processes in the body and mind taxes 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.550

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.380
 imbalances 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.420
