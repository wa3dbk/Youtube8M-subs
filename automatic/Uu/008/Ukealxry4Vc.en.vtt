details about recurrent corneal erosion
syndrome<00:00:14.839> which<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.020> problem<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.980> can

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
syndrome which is a problem that can

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
syndrome which is a problem that can
cause<00:00:17.430> significant<00:00:18.240> amount<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> pain<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
cause significant amount of pain and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.220 
cause significant amount of pain and
irritation<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.279> people<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.230> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
irritation in the people that have it to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.320 
irritation in the people that have it to
better<00:00:22.439> understand<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.670> let's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
better understand what this is let's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
better understand what this is let's
look<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> eye<00:00:24.840> model<00:00:25.230> where<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> cornea

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
look at the eye model where the cornea

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.220 
look at the eye model where the cornea
is<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> clear<00:00:27.269> shield<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.750> covers<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is the clear shield that covers the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.790 
is the clear shield that covers the
front<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> eye<00:00:28.880> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.449> surface<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.439> what

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
front of the eye on the surface is what

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
front of the eye on the surface is what
we<00:00:31.949> call<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.520> epithelium<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> thin

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
we call the epithelium that is a thin

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.740 
we call the epithelium that is a thin
layer<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.730> bit<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> skin<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
layer a little bit like this skin that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
layer a little bit like this skin that
covers<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> eye<00:00:37.579> because<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.790> layer<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
covers the eye because this layer is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.310 
covers the eye because this layer is
always<00:00:39.690> replaced<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> changes<00:00:41.160> over<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
always replaced and changes over and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
always replaced and changes over and
helps<00:00:43.320> provide<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> nice<00:00:44.129> smooth<00:00:44.579> surface<00:00:44.820> for

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
helps provide a nice smooth surface for

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.889 
helps provide a nice smooth surface for
the<00:00:45.629> eye<00:00:46.309> if<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.579> eye<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.700> scratched<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.690> hit

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the eye if the eye is scratched or hit

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.459 
the eye if the eye is scratched or hit
it's<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.590> easy<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.430> thin<00:00:51.149> layer<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
it's very easy for this thin layer of

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.010 
it's very easy for this thin layer of
epithelium<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> removed<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> call

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
epithelium to be removed in what we call

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.080 
epithelium to be removed in what we call
a<00:00:55.050> corneal<00:00:55.620> abrasion<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:58.020> painful

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
a corneal abrasion this is very painful

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.950 
a corneal abrasion this is very painful
but<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.359> heals<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.690> quickly<00:01:01.789> once<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.030> heals

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
but it heals very quickly once it heals

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
but it heals very quickly once it heals
back<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.640> directions<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.600> can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
back in from all directions it can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
back in from all directions it can
smooth<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> surface<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> eye<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
smooth out the surface of the eye and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.740 
smooth out the surface of the eye and
patients<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.420> feel<00:01:09.659> better<00:01:10.820> however<00:01:11.820> if

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
patients can then feel better however if

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.679 
patients can then feel better however if
this<00:01:13.350> happens<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> good

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
bad that they bother them a lot we may

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.220 
bad that they bother them a lot we may
consider<00:03:03.750> surgery<00:03:05.390> one<00:03:06.390> type<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.690> procedure

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
consider surgery one type of procedure

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.920 
consider surgery one type of procedure
that<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.370> take<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> needle<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.720> make

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that we can do is take a needle to make

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.520 
that we can do is take a needle to make
fine<00:03:10.560> impressions<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:12.000> area<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
fine impressions in the area of the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.150 
fine impressions in the area of the
erosion<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:16.380> create<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.710> small

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
erosion that we see to create a small

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.540 
erosion that we see to create a small
scar<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:18.000> create<00:03:18.300> better<00:03:18.540> adhesion<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:20.400> can

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
scar to create better adhesion we can

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.330 
scar to create better adhesion we can
also<00:03:20.670> do<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> treatment<00:03:21.420> called<00:03:21.780> PTK<00:03:22.590> which

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
also do a treatment called PTK which

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.400 
also do a treatment called PTK which
stands<00:03:23.610> for<00:03:23.730> photo<00:03:24.090> therapeutic<00:03:24.840> keratectomy

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
stands for photo therapeutic keratectomy

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.370 
stands for photo therapeutic keratectomy
which<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.550> basically<00:03:27.030> using<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> laser<00:03:27.959> that

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
which is basically using the laser that

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.640 
which is basically using the laser that
we<00:03:29.220> use<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.640> perform<00:03:29.820> LASIK<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:31.260> remove

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
we use to perform LASIK with to remove

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430 
we use to perform LASIK with to remove
some<00:03:32.010> layers<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:33.270> create<00:03:33.660> what<00:03:34.320> we

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
some layers and then create what we

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.610 
some layers and then create what we
think<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> better<00:03:35.160> adhesion<00:03:36.260> next<00:03:37.260> week<00:03:37.440> I'd

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
think is a better adhesion next week I'd

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.890 
think is a better adhesion next week I'd
like<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.890> give<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.190> more<00:03:38.370> details<00:03:38.850> about<00:03:39.000> ptk

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
like to give you more details about ptk
