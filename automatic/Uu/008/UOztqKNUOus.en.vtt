00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.330
 the day has come the day of days where 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.710
 I again open my barrier 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 looks like never to be and that 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.610
 Cluttered rooms which somehow always 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 will stay that way 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 but yes to the topic is I'll come 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.039
 math make math and do it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.060
 nothing will work because of that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.070
 many still seem to have a problem 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 some also ask me which ones to roll 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630
 play where is in the song play 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.580
 mostly in my games I have good 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.579
 because a bit matte is also there 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 it is here again eko fresh course I 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.250
 have here sometimes are ingame further 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.379
 you use it because I resisted some 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 it may be that I am somewhere with 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 both matte bit wrong with Wiegel 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 however, shit is on everyone 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 fall on the topic so what you see here 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 first up here is the westerschelde 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.100
 has and how much per lab to court 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.079
 that here the old vine skating the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.550
 is not that important to me right now 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.449
 somehow maybe somehow thought 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 a little smarter which you are involved 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.730
 but have that she is the momentary 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 scaling 75 percent of your basic l the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.100
 So basically what your apple is two 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.930
 just on it if once a blog and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 a green and the blue value is here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.360
 important and once here 50 percent 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.369
 because I have this with me now too 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.439
 this calculator used here to look 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.580
 how many apps from what moment with 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.590
 which items in the case I have now 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.020
 but made and are in there with me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 I just took the explanation with me 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.140
 the others do not care are you doing there 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.829
 I also took me but you did that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.299
 more importantly done and yes 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.820
 Anyway now off the topic so what 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.530
 Having here now is my strong ewald 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 I'm not sure which one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 moment my second field 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 I'm sure that's about it 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.930
 that's why I'm going to be three with 14 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 now work in first look main 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 standard actually double drums so 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 with it on one level and the song 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.630
 plays as I would have done earlier 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.280
 I give you lots of gold and buy 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.689
 have 200 ps torque is a bit 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.790
 martin does what the basica is concerned 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.730
 yes times here 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.110
 2 casey I get problems 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.050
 which then times increased because I'm so 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.970
 was seen for the 40 songs here 39 2 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.060
 did you then take plus plus with 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.810
 which ones already together 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.790
 come on 20 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:25.720
 which idea I have the same again 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:31.910
 for apa not made just 92 years 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.590
 but I just missed myself 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.550
 has 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.100
 I may already or I take the 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.820
 basic eggimann 0.75 on I have one 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.570
 would have made fault actually like 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.550
 to take things from where comes that is 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.820
 that's right, I'm such an official 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.780
 just here this 75% basecape that 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.739
 this 79 30 5 talk about details here 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.709
 I 69 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.450
 30 15 and last time the same here with 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.200
 the apps must be 213 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:12.190
 Well, what the hell does not do it now 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.780
 be sure to make the cake so much fatter 106 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 I do not care about his computer 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.239
 let me simply times no 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.410
 I simply unaware it again a 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.860
 and that does not matter is how we are here 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.560
 see 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.850
 do I have the waldau if we get away 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.160
 go out that I do not shit totally 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.070
 and everything and we too 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.590
 a two who with strong 1 winning hit 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.500
 from 175 to the moment when I mean 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.040
 My opinion if you have one 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.470
 standard situation 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580
 but now the thing is if we are 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.200
 Now compare with the old me 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.750
 I have 50 with the old management 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.030
 damage on it plus 75 percent 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.910
 my take off speaks this game was 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.310
 a lot stronger because the sounds 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.489
 Although already a 50% horny but like us 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.660
 See that it's not that much 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.730
 I think I'm in the lake game 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.590
 somehow to almost 100 partners squeeze 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.480
 he speaks with more going for it is a 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.550
 almost nothing considering that 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.170
 I'm going to do the laundry from now on 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.890
 I now also on another route and 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.360
 Although I build the same 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.269
 stadteinwÃ¤rtigen Katrin that 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.239
 cache that the cost was 300 gold more 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.979
 it's actually a mini doris one and a half 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.040
 minutes with ziemer games gold one 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.940
 amount runs and I get there for 100 api 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.250
 More so now you have to see it though 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.410
 As she is skating at all 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.770
 ok i have a relatively good skating 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.290
 on the ku my opinion also has one 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.250
 just skating that we are ourselves 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.840
 along with the hub with speed hps gay 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.600
 and my next does also has a 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.669
 gaming and so I have in the big and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.470
 All in all , I prefer a lot to four 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.300
 great benefit from it because I improve 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.979
 not only one thing is just me now 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.410
 Mainz said actually does not matter if 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.240
 I would do something better so that 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.400
 Ramadan has then by and large 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.770
 rather a greater influence than with 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.240
 bacon at the moment that's why I'm building 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.400
 that also so left bacon is mine 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.900
 really a stronger one 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.889
 lake area because if there are some 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.130
 this moment would come and me 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.160
 add here firstly to donate added in 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.630
 moment will be the power 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:28.130
 That's how force came there announced 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:31.860
 google so adds 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:39.240
 I update the whole but should like 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.639
 I've got a lot of coffee 429 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.110
 the stock exchange in berlin is now too close 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.380
 the moment where I'm not everything because of me 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.520
 I have mine if I do that again 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.220
 no idea about deer 17 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:58.919
 I do not know okay I am only on the 17th 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:05.160
 otherwise a bit 432 from I speak 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:09.020
 I guess where I say about 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.419
 300, and then from then on it's back because 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.820
 300 first with the whole Jewish one 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.830
 by the 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.170
 that's why it's much stronger and still 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.050
 as far as the cost efficiency is concerned 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.960
 really late as the third leg 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.520
 nobody than 2 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.710
 and that actually applies to 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.850
 others check in general so i'm mine 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.640
 not sure about the champions now 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:36.040
 relatively short course already have to 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:40.210
 I do not have a ludwig, for example 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.130
 make because although the columnist short but 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.260
 I get on the whole rather 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.430
 utility just when I use the kv 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:51.180
 all of a wale will be better my 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.830
 utilities stronger and so on 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.200
 not buying so much anymore it's mine 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.490
 do not think so smart and should 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.400
 however, other mathematical reiterates 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.050
 just i know i can not man and 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.630
 that's why it has always been that way 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.220
 or I hope I buy her 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.420
 accordingly no longer so early not 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.420
 why be so weak
