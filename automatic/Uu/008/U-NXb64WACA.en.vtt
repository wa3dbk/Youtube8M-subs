 to teach you a tutorial is worth a lot 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.960
 I've seen people in the forums 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.269
 questions of how objects are created and the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.320
 quiver that none have simple 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.090
 seen more than 25 bullets and such and we go then 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 I will teach them how to do it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 this is worth nothing before starting 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 Well, I'm going to show you the outfit 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.140
 according to flame according to what is called the attire 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.820
 from achilles 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 how do you get it you have to spend 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.170
 all the treasury missions all 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.900
 here we have it is pretty handsome 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 and they go pretty 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.710
 as you see 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.430
 and nothing now I will teach how they are created 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.720
 things we have to address this 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 book here book of accounts 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 if we hit the b or round button on my 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.120
 case we have here in development in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.110
 reservation we have all the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 ingredients the products that we can 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.120
 buy from our villagers the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 hacienda vale these products serve 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.290
 to manufacture what they come to do 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.140
 now the plans to get the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.000
 planes and be able to manufacture the quiver in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.150
 this case to make the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 from the container where they keep the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.310
 bow arrows is called the big 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.340
 has to be here is quiver 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.100
 well, we need resources 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.720
 we see that we need ash wood and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.830
 cow skin in this case I already have it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.560
 elaborated therefore does not let me 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.270
 create it and also has asked me to the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 people for private of someone who 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.770
 another asked me the double covers 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.430
 to put two pistols worth this is 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.709
 you need a rosewood and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.450
 Of course how you get this good 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.090
 then you have to collect pages of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.250
 Almanac is valid when you get pages from 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.110
 almanac will give us plans or 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.140
 following the main story they 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.320
 will give improvements or new objects to create 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.780
 and nothing like that was created the object is worth and as 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 you see here I have the double covers where 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.590
 I need the other gun and nothing guys 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.450
 I'm going to show you now how to build a 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 object ok suppose we want 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 build 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.460
 something that I do not have 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 well 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.440
 The same is true in this case I would fail 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.640
 and sewing I do not know how to get it 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 let's find something else 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630
 anything like that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:00.090
 is gunpowder let's say we need lead and 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.090
 sulfur let's reserve to see if we have 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.460
 sulfur is here we buy the amount 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.460
 that we want 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 and we buy it lead and sulfur and 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.260
 we need that in our our 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.350
 blacksmith our art is what we are going 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.560
 to make gunpowder 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.150
 have a level of three in this 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.410
 case I already have it because it is a level 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 maximum 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.420
 the art not the craftsmen rise 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.700
 level doing the hacienda missions 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.430
 It's worth the same missions and it will come out 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.690
 they have improvements and new products 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.280
 and when we have the product already 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.500
 selected we have all the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.320
 materials and everything we simply give to 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.400
 develop and ask us if we want it 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.500
 If we want to create it, we will confirm and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 we already have the object drawn good 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.810
 Well that's all kids I hope that I 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.240
 be served and nothing I hope that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.780
