be<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:35.820> game<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.240> black<00:01:36.450> ops<00:01:36.630> 1<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
be a good game because black ops 1 was a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
be a good game because black ops 1 was a
good<00:01:37.350> game<00:01:37.470> black<00:01:37.710> ops<00:01:37.799> 2<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.250> even<00:01:38.520> better

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
good game black ops 2 was an even better

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
good game black ops 2 was an even better
game<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.060> black<00:01:39.270> ops<00:01:39.420> 3<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.960> tuck<00:01:40.290> three<00:01:40.590> years

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
game in black ops 3 now tuck three years

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
game in black ops 3 now tuck three years
to<00:01:40.979> make<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> should<00:01:41.729> probably<00:01:42.180> hopefully

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to make so it should probably hopefully

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
to make so it should probably hopefully
be<00:01:42.720> an<00:01:42.840> even<00:01:43.170> better<00:01:43.350> game<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> guess<00:01:44.009> we'll

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
be an even better game but I guess we'll

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.530 
be an even better game but I guess we'll
just<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> wait<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.909> nobody<00:01:45.329> really

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
just have to wait and see nobody really

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
just have to wait and see nobody really

were<00:02:08.759> awesome<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.270> even<00:02:09.599> in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
were awesome you know even in

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270 
were awesome you know even in
competitive<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.709> final<00:02:11.009> kill

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
competitive when you get your final kill

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440 
competitive when you get your final kill
like<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.550> snd<00:02:11.940> or<00:02:12.060> something<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
like an snd or something like that and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.830 
like an snd or something like that and
you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.300 
you
floating<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> air<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.739> way<00:02:13.860> cooler<00:02:14.160> than

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
floating in the air it's way cooler than

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.710 
floating in the air it's way cooler than
just<00:02:14.580> dropping<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.060> ground<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.599> know

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
just dropping to the ground I don't know

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330 
just dropping to the ground I don't know
maybe<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.500> big<00:02:16.680> deal<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.890> me<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.280> I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
maybe it's just a big deal to me but I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.559 
maybe it's just a big deal to me but I
think<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.849> something<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.209> was<00:02:18.450> really

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
think that was something that was really

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.970 
think that was something that was really
cool<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.530> took<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.830> out

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
cool and they kind of just took it out

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.170 
cool and they kind of just took it out
of<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.160> game<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.550> no<00:02:20.670> reason<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.090> that

of this game for no reason and that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.910 
of this game for no reason and that
makes<00:02:21.450> me<00:02:21.599> sad<00:02:21.629> but<00:02:22.170> nevertheless<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.500> would

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
makes me sad but nevertheless it would

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.110 
makes me sad but nevertheless it would
make<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.160> happy<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.640> didn't<00:02:23.879> hit<00:02:23.970> a
