summer blooming bulbs and the fall

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
summer blooming bulbs and the fall
blooming<00:01:03.600> bulbs<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.320> theory<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.280> even

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
blooming bulbs my theory on that is even

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.370 
blooming bulbs my theory on that is even
if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.300> plant<00:01:06.540> them<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> summertime<00:01:07.350> or

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
if you plant them in the summertime or

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
if you plant them in the summertime or
in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> fall<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.190> they're<00:01:08.340> Hardy<00:01:08.760> any<00:01:09.510> time<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
in the fall if they're Hardy any time of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.030 
in the fall if they're Hardy any time of
the<00:01:09.960> year<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.500> time<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.860> plant

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the year is the good time to plant

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.350 
the year is the good time to plant
because<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.550> have<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> move

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
because then you have them we can move

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
because then you have them we can move
you<00:01:12.420> around<00:01:12.600> soak<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.260> plants<00:01:13.620> right<00:01:13.890> so

they're growing naturally it's been
becoming<00:03:37.000> developed<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.079> sad<00:03:38.319> because

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
becoming developed and it's sad because

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.440 
becoming developed and it's sad because
South<00:03:38.859> African<00:03:39.310> plants<00:03:39.609> they<00:03:39.700> say<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.060> 90

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
South African plants they say up to 90

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.909 
South African plants they say up to 90
percent<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.900> them<00:03:41.049> will<00:03:41.169> be<00:03:41.349> extinct<00:03:41.769> in<00:03:41.829> the

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
percent of them will be extinct in the

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.659 
percent of them will be extinct in the
next<00:03:42.129> hundred<00:03:42.280> years

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
next hundred years

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.220 
next hundred years
oh<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.239> think<00:03:43.389> if<00:03:43.660> you're<00:03:43.750> true<00:03:43.989> plant

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
oh so I think if you're true plant

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.809 
oh so I think if you're true plant
collector<00:03:44.680> we<00:03:44.799> should<00:03:45.010> save<00:03:45.190> our<00:03:45.310> natives<00:03:45.669> but

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
collector we should save our natives but

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
we really should save the natives from
