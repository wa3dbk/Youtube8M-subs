00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.920 

putting<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.090> together<00:01:23.270> with<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.720> right

the<00:01:39.600> second<00:01:40.110> line<00:01:40.289> for<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.649> left<00:01:40.829> hand<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
the second line for the left hand is

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.860 
the second line for the left hand is
going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.460 

I

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.390 

so<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.659> forth<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.769> way<00:02:13.980> these<00:02:14.159> two

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so on and so forth now the way these two

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.589 
so on and so forth now the way these two
lines<00:02:14.610> are<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.940> work<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> right

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
lines are going to work with the right

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.600 
lines are going to work with the right
hand<00:02:15.870> they're<00:02:16.319> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> alternate<00:02:17.069> so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
hand they're going to alternate so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.830 
hand they're going to alternate so
you're<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.849> play<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> first<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.629> and
