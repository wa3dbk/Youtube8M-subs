 Welcome to the user people 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.760
 my head of the service team 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 and may today cordially a to the 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.880
 coast the god in germany completely 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.859
 thank you so much for taking your time 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 have mr for this interview 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.820
 Germany is also a competitive athlete 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.290
 and was last as a participant in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 Olympic Games in Sochi 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.420
 and then was there to take part mister 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 take a shower and lie now 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.920
 over a year back that was in april 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 2013 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 how do you feel now over a year 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.850
 later what has changed for her 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.859
 it's just that the whole 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.979
 situation certainly already clear 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.600
 has changed on the side next to it 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.920
 with me since the intervention has been made 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.050
 my secret jaws more exactly 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.109
 and they're just filling up one now 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.999
 really dense hair and but it is 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.780
 All that was so bad 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.219
 come 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 that is never the other one 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 right from that is what we are now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 all at once, but very carefully 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 what is right, of course, about that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 her very pleasant and what were the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.939
 motives then what they ultimately do 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 initiates to his treatments 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.229
 to decide 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 yes that was maybe with 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.450
 Grandmother everything internationally motivated 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.549
 Because she said it is her debt 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.469
 to be up and running because it was her husband 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 which we have finished the plan 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.000
 so to speak Europe I wanted yes and the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.430
 is always in countries and the grandma moved 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 the teenie and sometime always one 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 a little uncomfortable but it was not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 so that it holds live with it know but 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.009
 one is simply thought well, yes, yes 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.480
 no matter if you can do something there why 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.650
 So do not 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.900
 and it's behind me was she 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.810
 always supports very positive and 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.060
 important the way and he shower you go 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.960
 because the treatment felt like it was 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.870
 that then experienced the day for you 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.970
 Now I have to say but you do 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.310
 always something presents itself and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.040
 it was totally enjoyable in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.480
 one of these senses is so familiar 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.480
 that was nice welcomed 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.510
 yes that was totally pleasant and very 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 astonished how many people like that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.530
 been involved in my treatment 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 So no idea where I guess that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.209
 were 10 12 sorry for what you did or 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.280
 if not only were more of this 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.230
 Mister that was really interesting and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 it did not hurt at all or something 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.300
 has there even up until the sore 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.300
 behind but that was actually in itself 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 tensioned spanned the arc spans a 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:03:11.930
 a bit in the front 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:15.299
 it is not pleasant but I believe 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 I know her from advertising resp 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.290
 So one connects moser medical in 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.360
 Austria already has as notation 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.570
 complete and if the mooser is still her 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 not that any like maple and then 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.260
 Home, of course, is not like that now 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.000
 that organizational money where they are now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.290
 half to be paid where stated on the website 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 have that's not it but it is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.100
 already a little sum well 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.570
 has thought new level so far track there 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.910
 it could not be cheaper anyway 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.070
 no idea about googles 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.579
 thorsten also on the internet it gives it 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:52.799
 or Turkey by the half or 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:54.750
 only a little less because I have 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.880
 others besides it's my health 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.599
 and that's my body here 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.819
 somewhere in hungary or in turkey 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:07.190
 maybe want to be disfigured if 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.190
 something if from 100 euro or 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.170
 to carry out such a planting 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.140
 to let 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.950
 what would they say then 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 It is important to convince that one 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.730
 That's just what you do with yourself 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.890
 finally feels good and if you are 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.650
 believes we need it now that was 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.750
 such a transplant of power and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.900
 can do then would the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.340
 next worry makes because you feel you 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.410
 with it somehow still a safe one 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.200
 self-confidence if you want that then 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.010
 you should also make it place 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.880
 it is best to support the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.010
 pursue family 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.750
 important was very likely 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.190
 thank you very much for 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.210
