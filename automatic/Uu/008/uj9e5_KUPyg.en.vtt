the beaten path so it's really fun to be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.960 
the beaten path so it's really fun to be
a<00:01:55.259> part<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.590> planning<00:01:55.950> process<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.610> you

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
a part of that planning process if you

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.460

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of travel and it's more about the
