00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.599
 pollination 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.880
 one of the most important activities the honey bees 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.179
 because of their work not only by the production of metal pollen 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.679
 propolis royal jelly 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.150
 but because of their effect and 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.790
 takes the large and pollen from the sea that goes to another outside the same species 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.580
 in several crops on several beaches nature 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.860
 the bees developed 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.210
 for hundreds of thousands of years 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.720
 doing this effect 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.020
 generation of fruits from the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.450
 pollen grain 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.160
 d on the ford of the male part of a flower of a shkolina form for the feminine part 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.580
 of another flower of the same species or to another form 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.090
 your girl affair of the same species some plant some crops with 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.810
 apple example 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.680
 exclusively a plant is male or female then it necessarily needs 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.910
 of a pollinating agent to carry this pollen grain 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.200
 this way the hordes plant March 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620
 out fernanda out fernanda fernandes 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.940
 sunflower for example is a sanction 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.680
 is exactly the same as apple tree 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.390
 in the presence of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.440
 we pick up call requirement are the main interview 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.720
 the presence of these pollinating agents guaranteed 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.799
 good range and grain production 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:34.750
 I ask 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.800
 of grains 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.010
 the theme of the garden closed by 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.240
 better or worse 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 achievement 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.680
 and then beekeeping becomes the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.680
 for the success of a good production 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.250
 here we have a young form 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 plants and young people 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.059
 ah 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.639
 advisors that are developing from the outside to the central part 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.149
 of the florence ensemble 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.369
 each says 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.040
 without considering that each of the parties is a good 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.599
 all of them 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.060
 if it's called a chapter then a generation is rather a set of flowers 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.369
 each of these 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.479
 from zero to 100 legs 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.629
 the managers 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.019
 need the pollen grain 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:32.829
 from the booklet 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.060
 to cancer 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.819
 the female part where to go 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.419
 the great ball and germinates and reaches or varies and fecund 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.729
 produce the grain 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.669
 then the bees guarantee this process said 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.149
 transfer 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.219
 of the pollen grain of one part and male to rascals 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.879
 among insects bees are the most feathers and most 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.730
 henry the most faithful 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.789
 I'm not dating these different mg 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.940
 the wing borders are the ones that have the most body 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.060
 perfected to carry pollen in all their hair until the eyes have 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.359
 by the minutes 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.389
 exist 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.500
 helinho ski 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.649
 held a grain of pollen 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:18.349
 among bees that is more easily managed by beekeepers 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.870
 against the dir produce 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.359
 with tarpaulins with a 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.939
 thousands of bees 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.869
 is the pivot Ã©rika the abl is that beau bee produces 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.999
 the africanext nothing that everyone knows that in some cities is a disorder 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.089
 but that in the field is a very important thing 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.189
 and has a second great value by a farmer 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.629
 is the producer and by the production d 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.529
 propolis partner is also a product that can be commercialized in the world 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.100
 at a later stage 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.210
 sunflower plant development 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.580
 the funorte has already begun to fall it begins to fall 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.939
 the chapter 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.359
 and start to appear the grain information 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.560
 each one 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.690
 in turn received a good faith from the action 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.479
 by the bees 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.240
 the two below said 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.550
 with a large 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.849
 the taco in the d 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.909
 he praises 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.879
 capacity 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:29.840
 of life 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 each one of these is a future one of the plant but 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.159
 how is sunflower treated with the agricultural plant 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.330
 We will not go 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.620
 cultivate again this grain and passwords a gala to extract the eye 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.830
 each of these grains 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.009
 rich in oil 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.659
 it happens now 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.210
 one and farmer's patrimony 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.470
 guaranteed by the effect of bees 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.340
 the embrapa temperate climate recognizing the importance of this interaction 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.509
 between outside and production 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.580
 hyundai melo and bees products 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.770
 where mutual benefit through pollination is a form of 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.949
 well-developed a series of research papers does not rain 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.099
 in the part of the production of the grains in the improvement of the date of the farms but 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:13.669
 also 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.909
 on the issue of 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.659
 the lens action 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.150
 the use of bees 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 within this system 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.050
 I thank God 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 all that means 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:29.999
 ah 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.169
 the true meaning of the action is much greater than that 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.569
 means the guarantee of the perpetuation of plant species
