atomic<00:01:14.490> timekeeping<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:16.049> gets<00:01:16.350> its<00:01:16.530> time

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
atomic timekeeping it gets its time

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
atomic timekeeping it gets its time
through<00:01:17.729> updates<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> middle<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
through updates in the middle of the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.550 
through updates in the middle of the
night<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.310> Fort<00:01:20.909> Collins<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.689> Colorado

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
night from the Fort Collins in Colorado

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.730 
night from the Fort Collins in Colorado
I<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.180> 2<00:01:24.630> a.m.<00:01:25.020> 4<00:01:25.710> a.m.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I think it's like 2 a.m. 4 a.m.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
I think it's like 2 a.m. 4 a.m.
something<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> receives<00:01:27.240> an

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
something like that it receives an

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.569 
something like that it receives an
update<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.100> time<00:01:29.369> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
update and that way that the time is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.100 
update and that way that the time is
always<00:01:29.720> dead-on<00:01:31.070> secondly<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> watch<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
always dead-on secondly the watch is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
always dead-on secondly the watch is
solar-powered<00:01:34.110> gets<00:01:34.770> his<00:01:34.890> power<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
solar-powered gets his power from the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
solar-powered gets his power from the
Sun<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:35.880> any<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:36.180> light<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> stays

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Sun or any other light so it stays

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.770 
Sun or any other light so it stays
charged<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.119> fact<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> full

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
charged all the time in fact on a full

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.770 
charged all the time in fact on a full
charge<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.189> last<00:01:41.400> 11<00:01:41.909> months<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.329> pitch

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
charge it will last 11 months in pitch

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710

what's really neat about this watch is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.999 
what's really neat about this watch is
when<00:02:01.640> you're<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.210> dark<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.649> turn

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
automatically comes on so that's a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.680 
automatically comes on so that's a
really<00:02:11.580> neat<00:02:11.730> feature<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.360> feeling

watch<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.690> waterproof<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:31.450> honestly

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
watch is waterproof and and honestly

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.660 
watch is waterproof and and honestly
I'll<00:03:31.959> say<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.260> casing<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> whole

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
I'll say the casing just just the whole

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.199 
I'll say the casing just just the whole
watch<00:03:33.910> as<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.570> whole<00:03:34.959> is<00:03:35.489> super<00:03:36.489> sturdy<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.060> mean

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
watch as a whole is super sturdy I mean

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.190 
watch as a whole is super sturdy I mean
you<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.420> tell<00:03:37.570> when<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.810> hold<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.049> in<00:03:38.170> your

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
you can tell when you hold it in your

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
you can tell when you hold it in your
hand<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.130> band<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.730> super<00:03:40.209> thick<00:03:41.880> being<00:03:42.880> a

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
hand the band is super thick being a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.539 
hand the band is super thick being a
g-shock<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.750> guess<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.080> means<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.739> shock

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
g-shock I guess that means it's shock

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.280 
g-shock I guess that means it's shock
resistant<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.269> if<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.390> drop<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:46.930> stuff

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
resistant so if you drop it and stuff

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.460 
resistant so if you drop it and stuff
it's<00:03:47.500> not<00:03:47.650> gonna<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.900> not<00:03:50.080> gonna<00:03:50.170> do<00:03:50.320> any

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's not gonna it's not gonna do any

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.350 
it's not gonna it's not gonna do any
harm<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.220> read<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.549> bunch<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.850> reviews<00:03:52.090> on
