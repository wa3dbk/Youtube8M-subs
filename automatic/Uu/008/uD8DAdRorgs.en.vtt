00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
challenging if you get unlucky you do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
challenging if you get unlucky you do
not<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> mask<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
not get the mask that's what it is that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370 
not get the mask that's what it is that
we're<00:01:17.100> trying<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.420> black<00:01:18.960> witch

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
we're trying to get is a black witch

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.510 
we're trying to get is a black witch
mask<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> pretty<00:01:21.000> awesome<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.520> here's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
mask which is pretty awesome but here's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.450 
mask which is pretty awesome but here's
the<00:01:23.700> downside<00:01:24.030> doing<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.460> because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the downside doing this is that because

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.429 
the downside doing this is that because
these<00:01:26.939> enemies<00:01:27.330> only<00:01:27.450> spawn<00:01:27.750> once<00:01:28.140> you're

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
these enemies only spawn once you're

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
these enemies only spawn once you're
going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> burn<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.009> lot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.250> bonfire

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
going to have to burn a lot of bonfire

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.789 
going to have to burn a lot of bonfire
aesthetics<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> increase<00:01:31.770> your

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
aesthetics that's going to increase your

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.370 
aesthetics that's going to increase your
bonfire<00:01:32.340> intensity<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> make

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
bonfire intensity and just going to make

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.420 
bonfire intensity and just going to make
the<00:01:34.560> area<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.549> harder<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> yeah

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the area a lot harder as you go so yeah

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
the area a lot harder as you go so yeah
this<00:01:38.909> place<00:01:39.060> sucks<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.960> you're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.200> to

Belle Covenant so if you're playing
online<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.670> invaded<00:01:51.140> honestly<00:01:52.140> if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

like a moth freeze from the Elder

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.520 
like a moth freeze from the Elder

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.240 
Scrolls games now it has a special
effect

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
effect

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.120 
effect
it<00:02:59.310> raises<00:02:59.640> magic<00:03:00.390> attack<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.410> lowers<00:03:01.800> max

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
it raises magic attack and it lowers max

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.540 
it raises magic attack and it lowers max
HP<00:03:02.570> now<00:03:03.570> honestly<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.350> doesn't<00:03:04.590> lower<00:03:04.950> your<00:03:05.190> HP

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
HP now honestly it doesn't lower your HP

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.030 
HP now honestly it doesn't lower your HP
all<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.970> much<00:03:06.240> but<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.350> doesn't<00:03:07.800> really

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
all that much but it doesn't really

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
all that much but it doesn't really
increase<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:08.760> magic<00:03:09.330> attack<00:03:09.660> all<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.050> much

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
increase your magic attack all that much

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.740 
increase your magic attack all that much
either<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.620> think<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.070> anywhere<00:03:11.430> between

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
either I think it's anywhere between

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.440 
either I think it's anywhere between
three<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.990> five<00:03:13.290> percent<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:14.190> did<00:03:14.910> not<00:03:15.060> realize

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
three to five percent I did not realize

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.960 
three to five percent I did not realize
how<00:03:15.480> bad<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.020> really<00:03:16.650> was<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.489> think

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
how bad this really was but I do think

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.610 
how bad this really was but I do think
it's<00:03:18.090> worth<00:03:18.330> getting<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.930> because<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's worth getting it because it is a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's worth getting it because it is a
really<00:03:20.070> rare<00:03:20.250> piece<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.670> armor<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.989> would

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
really rare piece of armor and I would

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.780 
really rare piece of armor and I would
imagine<00:03:22.320> sometime<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> future<00:03:23.459> they're

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
imagine sometime in the future they're

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.699 
imagine sometime in the future they're
going<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.390> buff<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:24.840> thing<00:03:25.080> because

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
going to have to buff this thing because

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.410 
going to have to buff this thing because
it's<00:03:25.890> just<00:03:25.980> no<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.519> right<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:26.910> they<00:03:27.150> can't

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
it's just no good right now they can't

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.720 
it's just no good right now they can't
have<00:03:27.780> different<00:03:28.620> things<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> game<00:03:29.670> that

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
have different things in the game that

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.030 
have different things in the game that
are<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.300> pretty<00:03:30.570> much<00:03:30.780> useless<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.709> nobody

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
are like pretty much useless and nobody

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.940 
are like pretty much useless and nobody
uses<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.530> pointless

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
uses it because that just is pointless

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.070 
uses it because that just is pointless
