 The final rehearsal is taking place 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:27.780
 We will continue to enjoy music to the general public since 1984 when our orchestra was established 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.090
 It is a concert that has been 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.700
 Second 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:40.800
 We aimed at this day and were active 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 Let's introduce a part of the activity centering on Sagamihara campus 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:01:02.500
 There is a practice room with soundproofing equipment on the first floor of the basement 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:06.510
 I usually borrow this practice room and a part of the lecture room and each member performs individual practice and part practice

 We do every Wednesday and Saturday 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:27.100
 The group is asking for guidance from professional trainers 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 This is to efficiently practice in a short time 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.870

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 Funeral services are carried out by different staff members with different contents 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.630
 Sharing time is very valuable 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 It took less than two hours, but thanks to the trainer , this day's practice was 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.500

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:31.270
 We deepen a sense of unity in joint camps using regular joint practice and summer vacation 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.270
 The effect may come to a light day for the Kanagawa Prefecture Brass Band Competition's Gold Award. 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.410
 Performances incorporating choreography do not indicate the distance between campuses 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.670

 Mr. Nishimura who is active as a professional 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.570
 We have been asking the regular conductor of our orchestra since 1989 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.570

 This passionate instruction is not only a shortcut to progress 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:43.130
 It enriches the way of thinking and thinking of things 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:48.370
 In this blessed environment that has been passed down from seniors 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.370
 The visits continue to be meaningful activities 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.680
 The day of the live performance concert 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.680

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.930
 And for the third grader it is the last concert of active duty 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.739
