paramore things two magics in a cube
twist<00:00:56.960> magic<00:00:57.960> clock<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.949> guess<00:01:01.949> i'm<00:01:02.129> going

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
twist magic clock so i guess i'm going

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
twist magic clock so i guess i'm going
to<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.609> i<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> pair<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> morphing

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to do i think this is a pair of morphing

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
to do i think this is a pair of morphing
some<00:01:04.820> says<00:01:05.820> lan<00:01:06.570> lan<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> stickers

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
some says lan lan and so the stickers

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.810 
some says lan lan and so the stickers
aren't<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> great<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.310> missing<00:01:17.729> a

stated hopefully I won't have to
restring<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.850> because<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.330> my<00:02:54.980> ghost

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980

designed<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.680> restring<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.040> because<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
designed to restring it because it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.670 
designed to restring it because it
popped<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.820> place<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.330> anyway<00:03:01.320> that's

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
clock and I'll do a comparison video and

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:39.909 
clock and I'll do a comparison video and
review<00:05:31.190> soon<00:05:33.800> anyway<00:05:35.389> so<00:05:36.389> it's<00:05:36.599> pretty<00:05:36.750> good
