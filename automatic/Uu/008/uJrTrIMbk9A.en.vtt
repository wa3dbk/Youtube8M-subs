00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.370 

the<00:00:02.939> idea<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.270> replacement<00:00:03.750> human<00:00:04.020> body<00:00:04.170> parts

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
the idea of replacement human body parts

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.070 
the idea of replacement human body parts
has<00:00:04.620> long<00:00:04.799> been<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.040> staple<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.460> sci-fi<00:00:06.080> but

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
has long been a staple of sci-fi but

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.990 
has long been a staple of sci-fi but
it's<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.319> concept<00:00:07.680> even<00:00:07.890> realistic<00:00:08.189> 3d

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
it's that concept even realistic 3d

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.280 
it's that concept even realistic 3d
printing<00:00:09.420> has<00:00:09.510> revolutionized<00:00:10.139> everything

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
printing has revolutionized everything

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.799 
printing has revolutionized everything
from<00:00:10.740> manufacturing<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.730> hobbies<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
from manufacturing to hobbies to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.509 
from manufacturing to hobbies to
medicine<00:00:13.259> researchers<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.400> Michigan

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
medicine researchers at Michigan

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.039 
medicine researchers at Michigan
engineering<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.450> already<00:00:15.690> been<00:00:15.809> able<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
engineering have already been able to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.010 
engineering have already been able to
produce<00:00:16.230> ears<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.369> noses<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> has<00:00:18.869> us

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
produce ears and noses so that has us

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.080 
produce ears and noses so that has us
wondering<00:00:19.199> will<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.250> ever<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.670> able<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> print

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
wondering will we ever be able to print

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
wondering will we ever be able to print
the<00:00:21.240> entire<00:00:21.570> human<00:00:21.930> body<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.580> tell<00:00:23.730> us

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the entire human body so can you tell us

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.099 
the entire human body so can you tell us
a<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> process<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.960> goes

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
a little bit about the process that goes

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.419 
a little bit about the process that goes
into<00:00:25.320> 3d<00:00:25.740> printing<00:00:26.099> human<00:00:26.340> body<00:00:26.519> parts

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
into 3d printing human body parts

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.890 
into 3d printing human body parts
so<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.609> say<00:00:29.789> printing<00:00:30.420> human<00:00:30.720> body

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so when you say printing human body

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
so when you say printing human body
parts<00:00:31.170> you're<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.529> talking<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.270> two

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
parts you're really talking about two

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.690 
parts you're really talking about two
processes<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.739> designing<00:00:35.340> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
processes one is actually designing so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
processes one is actually designing so
we're<00:00:35.820> gonna<00:00:35.940> take<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.360> example<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.840> CT<00:00:37.649> scan

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we're gonna take for example a CT scan

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.790 
we're gonna take for example a CT scan
of<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.280> patient's<00:00:38.820> jaw<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.170> defect<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of this patient's jaw and the defect and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
of this patient's jaw and the defect and
we're<00:00:40.980> actually<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.670> design<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.570> part<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we're actually going to design a part to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
we're actually going to design a part to
fit<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.950> defect<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.879> once<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> have

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
fit in that defect then once you have

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
fit in that defect then once you have
that<00:00:45.690> design<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> file<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.920> feed<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that design in the file you feed that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.090 
that design in the file you feed that
file<00:00:47.730> into<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> 3d<00:00:48.570> printer<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.649> printer<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
file into the 3d printer that printer a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
file into the 3d printer that printer a
software<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> essentially<00:00:51.180> slices<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
software that essentially slices it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
software that essentially slices it
layer<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.260> layer<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.949> could<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> laser

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
layer by layer it could be the laser

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.029 
layer by layer it could be the laser
beam<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.180> centers<00:00:54.750> material<00:00:55.170> together<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
beam that centers material together it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
beam that centers material together it
could<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> nozzle<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.090> essentially

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
could be a nozzle that essentially

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
could be a nozzle that essentially
squeezes<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.350> material<00:00:58.829> along<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.430> path<00:00:59.730> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
squeezes out material along that path so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720 
squeezes out material along that path so
how<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> grow<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.410> human<00:01:01.829> ear<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> one

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
how do you grow a human ear off of one

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
how do you grow a human ear off of one
of<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.940> parts<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.979> say<00:01:05.159> there's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of these parts so I would say there's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
of these parts so I would say there's
three<00:01:05.700> potential<00:01:06.330> avenues<00:01:07.159> down<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.400> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
three potential avenues down which we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.380 
three potential avenues down which we
could<00:01:08.729> grow<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.799> human<00:01:10.799> ear<00:01:11.040> let's<00:01:11.250> say<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
could grow a human ear let's say one is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
could grow a human ear let's say one is
doing<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> lab<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.860> essentially<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
doing it in the lab so essentially you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
doing it in the lab so essentially you
print<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.650> scaffolding<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> material

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
print the scaffolding and the material

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
print the scaffolding and the material
you<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:18.000> whatever<00:01:18.360> cells<00:01:18.750> are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you then take whatever cells are

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.859 
you then take whatever cells are
relevant<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.460> tissue<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:21.390> those<00:01:21.570> into

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
relevant for that tissue put those into

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.179 
relevant for that tissue put those into
the<00:01:21.990> material<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.770> grow<00:01:22.950> those

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the material then you could grow those

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
the material then you could grow those
in<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.490> incubator<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.600> implant<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
in an incubator and then implant it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
in an incubator and then implant it
that's<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.680> approach<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.970> second<00:01:27.330> approach

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that's one approach the second approach

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
that's one approach the second approach
is<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.009> normal<00:01:29.040> implant

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
is what we would do in a normal implant

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370 
is what we would do in a normal implant
and<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.299> print<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> material<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and that we would print the material and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
and that we would print the material and
then<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:31.950> directly<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> plant<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
then actually just directly and plant it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
then actually just directly and plant it
into<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> defect<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> maybe<00:01:35.009> hope<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
into the defect and maybe hope that the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.020 
into the defect and maybe hope that the
host<00:01:36.119> cells<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.170> person<00:01:37.530> actually

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
host cells from the person actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.130 
host cells from the person actually
migrated<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> part<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> grow<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
migrated into the part and grow the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.700 
migrated into the part and grow the
tissue<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.659> third<00:01:42.659> Avenue<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> somewhat<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
tissue the third Avenue is somewhat of a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
tissue the third Avenue is somewhat of a
hybrid<00:01:44.040> between<00:01:44.399> those<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
hybrid between those two but in this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.719 
hybrid between those two but in this
case<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> we're<00:01:46.560> gonna

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
case what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
case what we're gonna do is we're gonna
prefabricate<00:01:47.729> our<00:01:47.880> pre<00:01:48.119> design<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.869> layout

well<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.660> define<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
well I think you have to define what you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.880 
well I think you have to define what you
mean<00:02:13.170> uh<00:02:13.200> sprint

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
mean uh sprint

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100 
mean uh sprint
I<00:02:13.920> mean<00:02:14.190> basically<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.930> do

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I mean basically right now we can and do

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.280 
I mean basically right now we can and do
print<00:02:17.480> biomaterials<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.959> implant

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
print biomaterials that we can implant

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
print biomaterials that we can implant
in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> body<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.220> terms<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.730> actually

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
in the body in terms of actually

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.369 
in the body in terms of actually
printing<00:02:21.690> tissue<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.239> cells<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.140> can

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
printing tissue and cells that we can

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.259 
printing tissue and cells that we can
grow<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.860> real<00:02:26.190> tissue<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> lab<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.180> then

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
grow as real tissue in the lab and then

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059 
grow as real tissue in the lab and then
implant<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.840> potentially<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.830> could

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
implant that potentially you could

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.460 
implant that potentially you could
implant<00:02:29.580> those<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.940> some<00:02:30.330> body<00:02:30.630> locations<00:02:31.260> but

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
implant those in some body locations but

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.050 
implant those in some body locations but
the<00:02:31.620> difficulty<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.160> they<00:02:32.430> don't<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.819> lot

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the difficulty is they don't have a lot

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.330 
the difficulty is they don't have a lot
of<00:02:33.290> mechanical<00:02:34.290> integrity<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.130> put

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
of mechanical integrity so if you put

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
of mechanical integrity so if you put
them<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> defect<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> body<00:02:36.630> they<00:02:36.930> are

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
them in a defect in the body they are

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.949 
them in a defect in the body they are
likely<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.920> collapse<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.330> would<00:02:39.599> say<00:02:39.810> in

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
likely to collapse so I would say in

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.839 
likely to collapse so I would say in
terms<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.349> printing<00:02:40.860> tissues<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.519> actually

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
terms of printing tissues and actually

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.280 
terms of printing tissues and actually
growing<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> laboratory<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.170> then

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
growing them in the laboratory and then

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.280 
growing them in the laboratory and then
implanting<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.150> we're<00:02:45.150> probably<00:02:45.360> 10<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.959> 15

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
