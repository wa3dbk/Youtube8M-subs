00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
here because what happens when this so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039 
here because what happens when this so
as<00:01:22.979> gets<00:01:23.280> tight<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.790> rotates<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.570> pelvis

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
as gets tight it rotates that pelvis

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.260 
as gets tight it rotates that pelvis
forward<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> puts<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:26.970> arch

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
forward all right and puts a big arch

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
forward all right and puts a big arch
right<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.680> this

right down on the back because this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
right down on the back because this

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
muscle goes up over here and catches up

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.190 
muscle goes up over here and catches up
to<00:01:31.470> t11<00:01:32.070> t12<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> spine<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> we've<00:01:34.049> got

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to t11 t12 up on the spine and we've got

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
to t11 t12 up on the spine and we've got
to<00:01:34.320> make<00:01:34.439> sure<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> gets<00:01:35.040> lengthened

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to make sure that that gets lengthened

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.429 
to make sure that that gets lengthened
out<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> when<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
out here so that when we get back and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
out here so that when we get back and
we're<00:01:37.560> performing<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
we're performing all right this is in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
we're performing all right this is in
tight<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.619> area<00:01:40.829> gets<00:01:41.189> torn<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.670> here

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
tight and this area gets torn in here
