some other foods like oranges or like

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.309 
some other foods like oranges or like
clementines<00:03:24.639> or<00:03:24.849> tangerines<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:26.049> can't

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
clementines or tangerines you just can't

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.500 
clementines or tangerines you just can't
give<00:03:26.500> them<00:03:26.650> too<00:03:26.889> much<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.310> stuff<00:03:27.639> because

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
give them too much of that stuff because

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.629 
give them too much of that stuff because
then<00:03:29.109> that<00:03:29.380> won't<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.889> good<00:03:30.069> for<00:03:30.130> them<00:03:30.430> and

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
then that won't be good for them and

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.509 
then that won't be good for them and
they<00:03:30.700> might<00:03:30.880> get<00:03:31.090> sores<00:03:31.480> or<00:03:31.750> something<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.519> I

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
they might get sores or something and I

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.610 
they might get sores or something and I
recommend<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:34.269> they<00:03:34.450> are<00:03:34.599> really<00:03:34.959> young<00:03:35.349> you

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
recommend if they are really young you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.890 
recommend if they are really young you
have<00:03:35.919> to<00:03:36.069> give<00:03:36.190> them<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.459> day<00:03:36.609> or<00:03:36.669> two<00:03:36.940> after<00:03:37.150> you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
have to give them a day or two after you

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.509 
have to give them a day or two after you
get<00:03:38.049> them<00:03:38.230> from<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> pet<00:03:38.769> store<00:03:38.799> that's<00:03:39.310> why<00:03:39.489> I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
get them from the pet store that's why I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.819 
get them from the pet store that's why I
had<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.940> do<00:03:40.090> with<00:03:40.239> floppy<00:03:40.510> because<00:03:41.230> he<00:03:41.500> had<00:03:41.650> to

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
had to do with floppy because he had to

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.710 
had to do with floppy because he had to
get<00:03:41.980> used<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.609> environment<00:03:42.790> around<00:03:43.299> him

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
get used to the environment around him

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.699 
get used to the environment around him
and<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:45.220> his<00:03:45.430> little<00:03:45.790> cause<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.810> recommend

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
and for his little cause I recommend

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.940 
and for his little cause I recommend
that<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.819> if<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.660> just<00:03:50.019> got<00:03:50.410> them<00:03:50.739> and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
that like if you just got them and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.430 
that like if you just got them and
they're<00:03:51.069> still<00:03:51.489> babies<00:03:51.819> then<00:03:52.599> you<00:03:53.200> should

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
they're still babies then you should

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.039 
they're still babies then you should
probably<00:03:53.739> like<00:03:54.549> wait<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> little<00:03:55.299> while<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.870> cut

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
probably like wait a little while to cut

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.749 
probably like wait a little while to cut
their<00:03:56.290> nails<00:03:56.440> no<00:03:56.739> matter<00:03:56.980> if<00:03:57.160> they're<00:03:57.400> sharp

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
their nails no matter if they're sharp

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.449 
their nails no matter if they're sharp
but<00:03:58.539> if<00:03:58.840> they're<00:03:59.169> sharp<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.769> should

and my dad also got me some willow
sticks<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:28.360> they're<00:04:28.750> allowed<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.500> chew<00:04:29.979> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
sticks that they're allowed to chew and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.219 
sticks that they're allowed to chew and
smaller<00:04:30.820> they're<00:04:31.180> not<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.539> for<00:04:31.750> like<00:04:31.930> biting

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
smaller they're not just for like biting

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.969 
smaller they're not just for like biting
and<00:04:33.300> anyways<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.330> would<00:04:34.870> also<00:04:35.080> recommend<00:04:35.440> you

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
and anyways I would also recommend you

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.939 
and anyways I would also recommend you
give<00:04:36.130> them<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.729> log<00:04:37.210> for<00:04:37.810> them<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.139> nom<00:04:38.380> so

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
give them like a log for them to nom so

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.589 
give them like a log for them to nom so
their<00:04:39.190> teeth<00:04:39.370> don't<00:04:39.610> get<00:04:39.759> too<00:04:39.940> long<00:04:40.180> cuz<00:04:40.449> you

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
their teeth don't get too long cuz you

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.749 
their teeth don't get too long cuz you
can't<00:04:40.930> file<00:04:41.229> them<00:04:41.530> because<00:04:42.009> that<00:04:42.160> isn't<00:04:42.400> good

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
can't file them because that isn't good

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.589 
can't file them because that isn't good
for<00:04:42.970> their<00:04:43.120> teeth<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:45.310> recommend<00:04:46.060> getting

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
for their teeth and I recommend getting

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.990 
for their teeth and I recommend getting
like<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.960> roomy<00:04:47.440> cage<00:04:47.740> depending<00:04:48.400> on<00:04:48.849> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
like a roomy cage depending on the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.300 
like a roomy cage depending on the
number<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.330> guinea<00:04:49.660> pigs<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.380> because

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
number of guinea pigs you have because

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.719 
number of guinea pigs you have because
then<00:04:52.120> they<00:04:52.900> need<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.199> lot<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.650> room<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.250> roam

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
then they need a lot of room to roam

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.879 
then they need a lot of room to roam
around<00:04:54.940> even<00:04:55.840> though<00:04:55.990> they're<00:04:56.169> really<00:04:56.380> small

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
around even though they're really small

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.279 
around even though they're really small
you<00:04:57.550> still<00:04:57.789> have<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.060> give<00:04:58.180> them<00:04:58.330> room<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.110> roam

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
you still have to give them room to roam

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.060 
you still have to give them room to roam
around<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.940> recommend<00:05:01.630> like<00:05:02.110> putting<00:05:02.889> them

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
around and I recommend like putting them

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.100 
around and I recommend like putting them
in<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.460> place<00:05:03.759> where<00:05:04.090> they<00:05:04.240> wouldn't<00:05:04.539> like<00:05:04.690> get

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
in a place where they wouldn't like get

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.750 
in a place where they wouldn't like get
hurt<00:05:05.500> by<00:05:05.800> anything<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:07.840> also<00:05:08.289> suggest<00:05:09.280> that

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
hurt by anything and I also suggest that

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.300 
hurt by anything and I also suggest that
you<00:05:09.970> get<00:05:10.120> either<00:05:10.419> two<00:05:10.990> males<00:05:11.470> from<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:12.010> same

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
you get either two males from the same

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.020 
you get either two males from the same
like<00:05:13.000> family<00:05:13.840> or<00:05:14.020> two<00:05:14.740> girls<00:05:15.520> if<00:05:15.849> you're
