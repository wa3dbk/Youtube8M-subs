per head point 5 percent alcohol and the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150 
per head point 5 percent alcohol and the
sweetness<00:04:11.390> got<00:04:11.810> some<00:04:12.020> residual<00:04:12.560> sweetness<00:04:12.710> to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
sweetness got some residual sweetness to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.430 
sweetness got some residual sweetness to
it<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.400> make<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> sugary<00:04:14.000> sweetness<00:04:14.330> yeah<00:04:14.750> but

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
it to make a sugary sweetness yeah but

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.930 
it to make a sugary sweetness yeah but
it's<00:04:15.590> actually<00:04:15.920> kind<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.370> hard<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.609> taste

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
it's actually kind of hard to taste

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.390 
it's actually kind of hard to taste
because<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:18.070> combination<00:04:19.070> combination

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
because of the combination combination

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.760 
because of the combination combination
there<00:04:19.970> because<00:04:20.150> there's<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.420> lot<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.810> but

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
there because there's a lot of it but

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.710 
there because there's a lot of it but
should<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:22.280> try<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.550> lobster<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:28.570> knit<00:04:29.570> those

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
should we try the lobster I knit those

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.280 
should we try the lobster I knit those
kind<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.140> all<00:04:30.290> together<00:04:31.510> yeah<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:33.110> doesn't

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
kind of all together yeah it doesn't

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.480 
kind of all together yeah it doesn't
make<00:04:33.470> much<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.860> difference

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
make much of a difference

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.440 
make much of a difference
I<00:04:34.520> think<00:04:35.240> no<00:04:36.280> it's<00:04:37.280> because<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.760> think<00:04:38.120> the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
I think no it's because I think the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.909 
I think no it's because I think the
seafood

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
actually overpower the lobster the power

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.030 
actually overpower the lobster the power
supplier<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.860> beer<00:04:46.040> yeah<00:04:50.770> what<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:51.800> still

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040

again<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.870> might<00:04:53.870> spice<00:04:54.169> nizzle<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.830> quite

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
again that might spice nizzle it's quite

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.920

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.030 
guess wouldn't be like blue classes but
it's<00:05:02.180> not<00:05:02.330> as<00:05:02.450> good<00:05:02.570> as<00:05:02.690> my<00:05:02.810> pilot<00:05:03.530> octopus

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040

the<00:05:57.639> best<00:05:57.849> champagne<00:05:58.270> style<00:05:58.569> paradise<00:05:59.080> but<00:05:59.289> it

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
the best champagne style paradise but it

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.189 
the best champagne style paradise but it
really<00:05:59.530> kind<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.889> mimics<00:06:00.219> it<00:06:00.780> right<00:06:01.780> so<00:06:01.990> the

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
really kind of mimics it right so the

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.459 
really kind of mimics it right so the
pressure<00:06:02.830> cork<00:06:03.280> which<00:06:03.580> could<00:06:04.210> have<00:06:04.360> been<00:06:04.509> shut

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
pressure cork which could have been shut

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.670 
pressure cork which could have been shut
out

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
out

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.689 
out
she<00:06:06.610> knew<00:06:06.789> but<00:06:08.250> definitely<00:06:09.250> not<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:09.430> best

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
she knew but definitely not the best

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.119 
she knew but definitely not the best
champagne<00:06:10.060> beer<00:06:10.270> out<00:06:10.389> there<00:06:10.419> that<00:06:10.750> say<00:06:10.870> my<00:06:11.050> day

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
but it's still pretty good worth

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.300 
but it's still pretty good worth
checking<00:06:14.169> out<00:06:14.319> depending<00:06:14.680> on<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.830> price<00:06:15.099> I'd

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
checking out depending on the price I'd

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.209 
checking out depending on the price I'd
