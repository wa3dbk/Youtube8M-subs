have<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> same<00:00:17.580> consistency<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:19.020> spread

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
have the same consistency so they spread

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.790 
have the same consistency so they spread
the<00:00:20.250> same<00:00:20.520> way<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> water<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.199> let's<00:00:22.439> get

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the same way in the water so let's get

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.940 
the same way in the water so let's get
started<00:00:22.980> by<00:00:23.460> building<00:00:24.029> our<00:00:24.480> bullseye

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:42.310 

you

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.110 

now<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> bullseye<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.129> complete<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.879> going

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now the bullseye is complete I'm going

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.560 
now the bullseye is complete I'm going
to<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.530> anchor<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.460> outer<00:00:47.670> ring<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.449> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
to first anchor the outer ring to the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.139 
to first anchor the outer ring to the
cup<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.199> when<00:00:49.409> we<00:00:49.559> draw<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.739> design<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.579> not

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cup so when we draw our design is not

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.050 
cup so when we draw our design is not
going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> move<00:00:51.449> around

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.030 

now<00:01:01.720> we're<00:01:01.930> just<00:01:01.960> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.350> go<00:01:02.530> ahead<00:01:02.650> and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
now we're just going to go ahead and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:13.670 
now we're just going to go ahead and
draw<00:01:03.310> a<00:01:03.580> basic<00:01:03.880> flower<00:01:04.809> design

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.900 

I<00:01:17.870> dip<00:01:18.870> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.110> center<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.070> clean<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
I dip in the center to clean up the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.860 
I dip in the center to clean up the
flower<00:01:22.940> now<00:01:23.940> i'm<00:01:24.120> going<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.630> ahead<00:01:24.660> and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
flower now i'm going to go ahead and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.560 
flower now i'm going to go ahead and
take<00:01:25.260> my<00:01:25.500> fake<00:01:25.770> nail<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:27.120> select<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
take my fake nail and just select the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
take my fake nail and just select the
design<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> i<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.710> i<00:01:28.979> think<00:01:29.490> i'm<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
design that i like i think i'm going to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
design that i like i think i'm going to
go<00:01:29.970> ahead<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> pick<00:01:30.660> these<00:01:30.930> three<00:01:31.290> petals

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
go ahead and pick these three petals

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.820 
go ahead and pick these three petals
because<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.910> three<00:01:33.180> petals<00:01:33.830> look

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
because i think these three petals look

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.609 
because i think these three petals look
better<00:01:35.070> than<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.640> petals<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> i'm

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
better than the other petals so i'm

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
better than the other petals so i'm
going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.830> aim<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:40.110> dip<00:01:40.320> down<00:01:41.570> now<00:01:42.570> i'm

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
going to aim and just dip down now i'm

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.709 
going to aim and just dip down now i'm
going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> clean<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> surface

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.569 

and<00:01:50.609> there<00:01:51.609> is<00:01:51.880> sea<00:01:52.179> water<00:01:52.479> marble<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:53.579> love

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
and there is sea water marble I love

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.300 
and there is sea water marble I love
this<00:01:54.820> color<00:01:55.119> combination<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:56.109> if<00:01:57.100> you're

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
this color combination and if you're

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.249 
this color combination and if you're
just<00:01:57.549> starting<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:58.149> do<00:01:58.420> water<00:01:58.659> marble<00:01:58.750> I

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
just starting to do water marble I

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.580 
just starting to do water marble I
highly<00:01:59.770> suggest<00:02:00.009> using<00:02:00.520> only<00:02:00.939> two<00:02:01.119> colors

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
highly suggest using only two colors

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.319 
highly suggest using only two colors
because<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.770> will<00:02:02.890> be<00:02:02.979> easier<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.579> select<00:02:03.969> two

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
because it will be easier to select two

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.460 
because it will be easier to select two
colors<00:02:04.750> vs.<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.560> four<00:02:05.890> or<00:02:06.069> five<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:07.379> find<00:02:08.379> that

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
colors vs. like four or five I find that

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.859 
colors vs. like four or five I find that
when<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.310> use<00:02:09.340> polishes<00:02:10.149> from<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.629> same

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
when you use polishes from the same

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.479 
when you use polishes from the same
brand<00:02:11.290> they<00:02:11.590> sort<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.099> have<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.459> same

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
brand they sort of have the same

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.479 
brand they sort of have the same
consistency<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.870> work<00:02:14.470> really<00:02:14.739> well<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
consistency and work really well in the

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.390 
consistency and work really well in the
water<00:02:15.700> with<00:02:16.180> each<00:02:16.420> other<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.799> hope<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.250> like
