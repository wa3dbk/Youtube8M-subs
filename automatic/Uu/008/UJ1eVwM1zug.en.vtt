00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.589
Hello CVG'sketeers and a warm welcome to the
Rumour Mill - a new name for an old show,

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.680
that sees us mashing together bowls of gaming
speculation, into a smooth, palatable paste.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.500
This week, we're feeding you Star Wars 1313.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.519
Let's kick things off straight away with the
name: 1313 refers to a level on the infamous

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.249
criminal underground of Coruscant - a typically
wretched hive of scum and villainy - through

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.990
which players will guide an as-yet unnamed
bounty hunter - but we'll come back to that

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.990
later.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.370
Thematically, it's looking a bit like Indonesian
action film The Raid, or if you haven't seen

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.269
that, the chintastic Dredd 3D.

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.660
What does that mean?

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.899
Well, numerous floors of ne'er do wells, a
beleaguered hero and Rancor-size portions

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.420
of arse to kick.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.179
The game takes place one thousand one hundred
and thirteen levels up from the surface of

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.390
the planet, but there are thousands of levels
above you as well.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.719
In the claustrophobia stakes, it's like being
the unfortunate filling in a criminal sandwich.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.149
Given the gritty subject matter, you can rest
assured that there won't be a Jar-Jar Binks

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.149
in sight.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.420
And, quite frankly, tired as we are of games
constantly getting darker and fightier, a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.340
Star Wars title aimed at a mature audience
has us licking our lips like Jabba the Hutt.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.729
And if you don't like that, there's always
Star Wars Kinect.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.140
Click here to watch Han Solo dancing!

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.390
[Cheesy] Han danced first.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.250
It's being developed in-house by LucasArts,
but the team are collaborating with LucasFilm

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.160
Animation, Skywalker Sound and Industrial
Light and Magic.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.759
As those names suggest, it's pretty big deal
- ILM have worked on just about every special

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.759
effect extravaganza worth mentioning, including
recent titles like The Avengers, Iron Man

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.140
2 and Pirates of the Caribbean.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.610
As if the stunning trailer wasn't enough of
a clue, this is going to be a triple-A experience

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.240
on a whole new scale.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.640
Seeing 1313 in action is like bridging the
gap between game and cinema, but don't expect

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.619
Quantic Dream's QTEs and frowning faces.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.759
This is all action, all the way - cover driven
combat that most closely resembles Uncharted.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.930
Moving on to release platforms, we initially
thought this could be solidly next-gen, but

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.970
it's been revealed that 1313 will also see
release on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC next year.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.459
No Wii U release has been announced.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.380
Right then, lets go back to the hero - or
anti-hero, to be more specific.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.810
When LucasArts first registered the numerous
domain names, it was practically nerdgeddon.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.430
The Star Wars massive jumped to the conclusion
that Lord Lucas was making a movie about Mandarlorian

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.180
bounty hunter Boba Fett - who, despite falling
into a spiky sand-anus in Return of the Jedi,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.110
is still one of the coolest characters in
the universe.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.900
Captain America director Joe Johnson even
stated that he was calling Lucas every day,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.750
begging to direct the spin-off.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.020
Does this mean that we'll see Boba in the
game?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.880
It's possible, but we don't know.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.950
The character we've seen was confirmed as
being 'Luke Placeholder', by creative director

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.360
Dominic Robilliard, and LucasArts are refusing
to reveal specific weapons as it will give

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.470
the character away.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.030
There are two other telling nuggets of info:
the first is that Boba Fett uses the alias

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.220
CT-1313 in the Clone Wars novel Boba Fett:
Maze of Deception.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.709
The second is that it looks like he has a
jetpack on his back.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.159
Keep those fingers crossed.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.019
Delving deeper into the lore, the presence
of tie fighters in the concept art suggests

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.090
that this will be set in the time of the rebellion,
possibly taking place before or during the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.800
first three films.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.099
If the protagonist is Mr Fett, it could nevertheless
be set after Jedi.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.099
How?

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.090
Thanks to that Mandalorian armour and his
trusty jetpack, he survives digestion by the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.159
Sarlaac arse-monster.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.180
That's all we've got for you for now, but
we're using our Jedi mind tricks right now

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.612
to make you rate, comment and subscribe - and
don't forget to join us again next week for

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:36.849
another Rumour Mill.
