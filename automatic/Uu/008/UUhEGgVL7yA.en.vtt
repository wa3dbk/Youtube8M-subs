during a medical school interview and
those<00:00:13.309> are<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:13.850> ethics<00:00:14.270> questions<00:00:14.860> whether

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
those are the ethics questions whether

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.790 
those are the ethics questions whether
you're<00:00:16.100> dealing<00:00:16.250> with<00:00:16.460> right<00:00:17.330> to<00:00:17.480> life<00:00:17.800> a

you're dealing with right to life a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920 
you're dealing with right to life a
right<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:19.430> choose<00:00:19.699> euthanasia

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
right to choose euthanasia

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.610 
right to choose euthanasia
death<00:00:21.560> with<00:00:21.800> dignity<00:00:22.480> there<00:00:23.480> are<00:00:23.690> really<00:00:24.110> from

death with dignity there are really from

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.530 
death with dignity there are really from
from<00:00:24.920> my<00:00:25.100> take<00:00:25.640> there<00:00:25.910> are<00:00:25.940> really<00:00:26.090> only<00:00:26.210> two

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
from my take there are really only two

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.890 
from my take there are really only two
approaches<00:00:27.670> available<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.030> for<00:00:29.750> how<00:00:29.840> you

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
approaches available to you for how you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.499 
approaches available to you for how you
answer<00:00:30.440> any<00:00:30.740> ethics<00:00:31.640> questions<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.270> I'm<00:00:32.360> gonna

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
answer any ethics questions so I'm gonna

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.150 
answer any ethics questions so I'm gonna
deal<00:00:32.719> with<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.200> ethics<00:00:33.559> questions<00:00:33.949> is<00:00:34.129> a

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
deal with the ethics questions is a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.430 
deal with the ethics questions is a
broad<00:00:34.460> category<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.329> teach<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.289> how<00:00:36.410> to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
broad category and teach you how to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.130 
broad category and teach you how to
answer<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.700> entire<00:00:38.000> category<00:00:38.600> of<00:00:38.720> questions

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
answer the entire category of questions

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.979 
answer the entire category of questions
rather<00:00:39.530> than<00:00:39.739> deal<00:00:40.700> with<00:00:40.970> each<00:00:41.210> individual

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
rather than deal with each individual

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.160 
rather than deal with each individual
ethics<00:00:42.500> issue<00:00:42.710> separately<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:44.870> first

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
ethics issue separately so the first

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.200 
ethics issue separately so the first
approach<00:00:45.470> I<00:00:45.980> consider<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.640> be<00:00:46.670> very<00:00:46.790> very

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
approach I consider to be very very

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.420 
approach I consider to be very very
difficult<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.020> basically<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.980> requires<00:00:49.130> a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
difficult and basically it requires a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.080 
difficult and basically it requires a
PhD<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.300> ethics<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:51.290> do<00:00:51.440> well<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.980> find<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
PhD and ethics to do well I find the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.299 
PhD and ethics to do well I find the
second<00:00:53.390> approach<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.899> be<00:00:54.020> super<00:00:54.530> easy<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.010> you

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
second approach to be super easy and you

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.120 
second approach to be super easy and you
can<00:00:55.550> learn<00:00:55.700> about<00:00:55.760> five<00:00:56.270> minutes<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.130> the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
can learn about five minutes so the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.690 
can learn about five minutes so the
first<00:00:58.430> approach<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.120> this<00:00:59.329> that<00:01:00.170> your<00:01:01.010> moral

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
first approach is this that your moral

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.970 
first approach is this that your moral
decision-making<00:01:02.149> your<00:01:02.809> ethical<00:01:03.260> values<00:01:03.770> are

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
decision-making your ethical values are

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.940 
decision-making your ethical values are
situational<00:01:04.759> and<00:01:05.079> relative<00:01:06.079> and<00:01:06.409> depend<00:01:06.799> on

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
situational and relative and depend on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.639 
situational and relative and depend on
context<00:01:07.399> this<00:01:08.329> means<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.840> sometimes<00:01:09.170> it's

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
context this means that sometimes it's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.090 
context this means that sometimes it's
okay<00:01:10.069> and<00:01:10.420> sometimes<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.780> particular<00:01:12.289> act<00:01:12.770> is

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
okay and sometimes a particular act is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.849 
okay and sometimes a particular act is
not<00:01:13.340> okay<00:01:13.759> for<00:01:13.999> example<00:01:14.959> sometimes<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.590> okay

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
not okay for example sometimes it's okay

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.739 
not okay for example sometimes it's okay
to<00:01:15.920> give<00:01:16.100> an<00:01:16.189> abortion<00:01:16.639> and<00:01:16.819> sometimes<00:01:17.539> it's

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
to give an abortion and sometimes it's

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.870 
to give an abortion and sometimes it's
not<00:01:17.810> okay<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.289> give<00:01:18.499> an<00:01:18.590> abortion<00:01:19.009> sometimes

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
not okay to give an abortion sometimes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.090 
not okay to give an abortion sometimes
it's<00:01:20.060> okay<00:01:20.389> to<00:01:20.420> help<00:01:20.749> someone<00:01:21.020> die<00:01:21.200> sometimes

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's okay to help someone die sometimes

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.080 
it's okay to help someone die sometimes
it's<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.549> okay<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.939> help<00:01:23.119> someone<00:01:23.479> die<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:25.090> find

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's not okay to help someone die I find

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.929 
it's not okay to help someone die I find
this<00:01:26.299> very<00:01:26.420> difficult<00:01:26.929> to<00:01:27.679> argue<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.429> it's

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
this very difficult to argue and it's

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.649 
this very difficult to argue and it's
very<00:01:29.329> difficult<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:30.020> defend<00:01:30.880> because<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.450> can

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
very difficult to defend because you can

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.569 
very difficult to defend because you can
very<00:01:32.899> quickly<00:01:33.139> get<00:01:33.529> yourself<00:01:33.889> caught<00:01:34.130> up<00:01:34.189> in

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
very quickly get yourself caught up in

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.379 
very quickly get yourself caught up in
an<00:01:35.029> ethical<00:01:35.509> sort<00:01:36.349> of<00:01:36.439> dilemma<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.909> puzzle

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:38.389 
an ethical sort of dilemma in a puzzle

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:42.959 
an ethical sort of dilemma in a puzzle
that's<00:01:38.630> really<00:01:38.929> really<00:01:39.079> hard<00:01:39.349> to<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:41.659> resolve

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
that's really really hard to to resolve

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.010 
that's really really hard to to resolve
the<00:01:43.969> second<00:01:44.420> approach<00:01:44.689> is<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:46.520> ethics<00:01:47.270> any

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the second approach is that ethics any

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.969 
the second approach is that ethics any
rule<00:01:48.499> any<00:01:48.950> ethical<00:01:49.310> rule<00:01:49.549> is<00:01:49.990> absolute<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.289> a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
rule any ethical rule is absolute and a

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.819 
rule any ethical rule is absolute and a
rigid<00:01:52.520> rule<00:01:52.849> that<00:01:53.270> never<00:01:53.659> changes<00:01:54.229> no<00:01:54.529> matter

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
rigid rule that never changes no matter

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.819 
rigid rule that never changes no matter
what<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.340> first<00:01:56.329> let<00:01:56.749> me<00:01:56.869> give<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.200> an<00:01:57.349> ethical

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
what a first let me give you an ethical

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.379 
what a first let me give you an ethical
relativist<00:01:58.779> position<00:01:59.779> on<00:02:00.049> abortion<00:02:01.389> let's

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
relativist position on abortion let's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.649 
relativist position on abortion let's
say<00:02:02.599> that<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:04.219> ethical<00:02:04.549> relativist<00:02:05.149> decides

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
say that the ethical relativist decides

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.719 
say that the ethical relativist decides
that<00:02:05.959> abortion<00:02:06.859> is<00:02:06.950> something<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.459> he<00:02:07.669> or

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that abortion is something that he or

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.960 
that abortion is something that he or
she<00:02:07.759> would<00:02:08.030> not<00:02:08.209> want<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.539> be<00:02:08.630> involved<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.140> so

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
she would not want to be involved in so

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.010 
she would not want to be involved in so
the<00:02:10.970> interviewer<00:02:11.300> might<00:02:11.510> say<00:02:11.750> what's<00:02:11.959> your

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the interviewer might say what's your

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.680 
the interviewer might say what's your
stance<00:02:12.290> on<00:02:12.410> abortion<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.070> then<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.210> ethical

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
stance on abortion and then the ethical

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.260 
stance on abortion and then the ethical
relativists<00:02:15.230> would<00:02:15.500> say<00:02:15.740> well<00:02:16.100> abortion<00:02:17.090> is

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
relativists would say well abortion is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.270 
relativists would say well abortion is
wrong

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
wrong

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.610 
wrong
however<00:02:20.480> there<00:02:21.480> are<00:02:21.510> some<00:02:21.810> exceptions<00:02:22.140> for

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
however there are some exceptions for

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.550 
however there are some exceptions for
