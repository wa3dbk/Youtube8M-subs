00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.250
 Ilyuha today I want to show you 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.830
 review hotel rooms form zion and so 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.420
 this is a deluxe room 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.019
 very cool door there is a lock 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.040
 electronic key is inserted here 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.339
 there are three switches 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 they regulate the lighting in the room 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.369
 only problems with which 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.229
 we faced two days of ours 

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:50.409
 stay here this is this light bulb 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.839
 which is upstairs we have it 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.089
 here we could not 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.830
 turn off because all the switches 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.439
 who are here and generally in 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.619
 they don't turn off the lamp in the room as a result 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:07.560
 I had to turn it out a big minus 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.729
 Next, let's start with the wardrobe 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 here a full-length mirror is possible 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.120
 take a look 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.230
 we shift here separation of course there is 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.770
 safe but it's down below let's show 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.100
 very comfortable have to fall on your knees 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.840
 and says cf open and climb there and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.150
 look but it's not very comfortable 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.050
 close here we have two offices where 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.350
 you can put 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.020
 also their things are still amazing 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.540
 hair dryer in the room 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.040
 here we have a minibar that gives tea and coffee 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.680
 you can drink 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.510
 well about boiling water you are best 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.250
 use the water that comes after 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.880
 tap water is better to never 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.180
 Of course that's going on on minibar 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.860
 beer and puma are given here 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.240
 one juice yes yes no very bad 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 cools will understand show 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.940
 bath she deserves special attention 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.479
 as you can see it is not transparent 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.140
 frightened and you live together or none 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.440
 it is all closed by such firms 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 but there are also flaws between the screens 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.600
 there is a gap and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.880
 and maybe the one to see from your 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.430
 neighbors here someone lives here farther 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 bath enchanting big wonderful very 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.900
 cool breaker 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.910
 I liked everything done very expensive 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 the sink is not surprising given 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.930
 shampoo and soap toothbrushes toothpaste 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.330
 the cap is actually made of a very 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.630
 expensive and because it is but glass and 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.890
 black tile is very cool well I understand 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080
 darling grass can 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.410
 wash and rain shower on is 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.810
 at the top is regulated water pressure superski 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.740
 here you can not put a record 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.600
 something of their belongings and so we 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.459
 moved the room of course all here 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.010
 this bath room will be yours 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.860
 you will not be visible on the floor 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.540
 soft carpet nice to walk nothing 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.610
 bad I can not say here, see 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.850
 is to call sony tv 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.980
 here is the Russian channel there are no foreign 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
 rip vice done with him cool 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.989
 the solution is a large shelf to which you can 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.790
 all put napkins are given a bed 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.480
 either one big or 2 separate 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 here we have 0 to 2 separate them 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.600
 combines one common large mattress 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.050
 although perhaps he lies wrong yes one 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.980
 big 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.620
 in total from 1 nightstand included to 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.500
 light 1 light here in fact 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.130
 included from different places and it is not clear how 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.950
 It will have to try very hard, and that's 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.690
 Moreover, 17 does not turn off 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.489
 here is the outlet at the bottom not 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.230
 very convenient control kondeem 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.580
 happens by 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.019
 only things are no remote plus everything 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.220
 I just searched for the keys for a long time 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.260
 inclusion she is well and three speeds 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.720

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 pokumekali 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.729
 and realized that these buttons are masters 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.960
 just turns off the lights in the whole room 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.409
 or was in switching on the light there 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.110
 then we are very 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.479
 searched long in the evening to turn off 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.919
 light but i couldn't understand what it was 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.229
 the button was I thought it was a challenge 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.569
 staff so become up to military big 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.029
 the sofa unfolds rather not 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.729
 laid out a cool old man 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.789
 a little magazine though not smoking 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.819
 number but day for loops prostrate and that is 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:05:00.339
 here we are 15 people in the class 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.319
 windows there or bulls in the room have a table 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:05.550
 two sockets for connecting equipment 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.289
 the light on key is just one 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.689
 phone can call 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.739
 inside the hotel in bangkok in thailand 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:18.309
 either take home a notebook and a pencil and 

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:20.919
 pens I did not find and so on for the title 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.219
 also very cool in the office chair on 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.329
 you can even rock it a little bit 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.589
 look and e100 problems consisted 

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:30.219
 most likely in our room 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:31.719
 this balcony has a lock here we 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.489
 initially also a very long time 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.739
 held 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:40.269
 understanding generally closed or open of course 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:43.300
 in the end it is closed but then I saw here 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:45.249
 this little cog and if its 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.959
 unscrew the balcony of who I am now and 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:48.729
 I will do it in the end if you need to open 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:51.429
 balcony you can use your 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.879
 key either a screwdriver and sin you have and 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:59.349
 just really unscrew 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:05.050
 This screw well, in principle, in all 4 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.969
 star hotels here and before before 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.389
