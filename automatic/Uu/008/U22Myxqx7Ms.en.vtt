bit weird so I'll show you that but the
colors<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.310> weird<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> closer<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
colors kind of get weird the closer you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.320 
colors kind of get weird the closer you
get<00:01:13.070> until<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:15.060> sense

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get until they don't really make sense

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.039 
get until they don't really make sense
anymore<00:01:16.850> anyway<00:01:17.850> yeah<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
anymore anyway yeah so you can see this

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
anymore anyway yeah so you can see this
bits<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.470> nice<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> patterned<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
bits all nice and patterned and that and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
bits all nice and patterned and that and
then<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.080> shoved<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> load<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> gold

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
then I just shoved a load of gold

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.910 
then I just shoved a load of gold
blocked<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.630> then<00:01:24.630> did<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:25.530> but

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
blocked here and then did this bit but

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.469 
blocked here and then did this bit but
yeah<00:01:26.070> apart<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
yeah apart from that bit I think it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.710 
yeah apart from that bit I think it
looks<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.240> quite

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
looks pretty good this one was quite

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.640 
looks pretty good this one was quite
difficult<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.680> said<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.189> has<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.650> arms

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
difficult as I said because has no arms

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
difficult as I said because has no arms
and<00:01:34.710> stuff<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.140> make<00:01:37.140> these<00:01:37.320> ones

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and stuff so you have to make these ones

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.499 
and stuff so you have to make these ones
as<00:01:37.829> completely<00:01:38.460> separate<00:01:38.970> things<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
as completely separate things to the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.539 
as completely separate things to the
rest<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.530> quite<00:01:40.950> difficult<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
rest of it and it's quite difficult to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.050 
rest of it and it's quite difficult to
do<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:43.020> build<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:44.060> that

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
do you have to like build from that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
do you have to like build from that
section<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> section<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.350> certain<00:01:46.649> amount

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
section to that section a certain amount

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
section to that section a certain amount
of<00:01:46.890> blocks<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.490> start<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.299> but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of blocks and then start this bit but

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
of blocks and then start this bit but
