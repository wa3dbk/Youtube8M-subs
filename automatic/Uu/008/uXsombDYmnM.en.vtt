landings<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.370> case<00:00:38.699> we're<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.059> base

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
landings now in this case we're on base

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.799 
landings now in this case we're on base
for<00:00:40.379> runway<00:00:40.739> 10<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> crosswind

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
for runway 10 and there's a crosswind

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
for runway 10 and there's a crosswind
from<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> left<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> base<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.520> effectively

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
from the left so on base I effectively

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
from the left so on base I effectively
have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> tailwind<00:00:45.900> so<00:00:46.080> one<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.769> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
have a tailwind so one thing you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.369 
have a tailwind so one thing you're
gonna<00:00:47.010> notice<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:47.850> starting<00:00:48.269> my<00:00:48.690> turn<00:00:49.080> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
gonna notice is I'm starting my turn to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.310 
gonna notice is I'm starting my turn to
final<00:00:49.979> a<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.059> earlier<00:00:51.720> than<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
final a little bit earlier than I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
final a little bit earlier than I
normally<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:53.220> because<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:54.000> wind<00:00:54.330> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
normally would why because that wind is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.119 
normally would why because that wind is
pushing<00:00:54.839> me<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.470> want<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.650> be<00:00:55.769> pushed

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
pushing me I don't want to be pushed

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.100 
pushing me I don't want to be pushed
through<00:00:56.430> final<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.479> flying<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.750> normal

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
through final just flying a normal

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.619 
through final just flying a normal
pattern<00:00:58.379> won't<00:00:59.250> cut<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.549> also<00:01:00.000> you'll<00:01:00.420> notice

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
pattern won't cut it also you'll notice

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.710 
pattern won't cut it also you'll notice
I'm<00:01:00.930> using<00:01:00.960> less<00:01:01.620> flaps<00:01:02.339> in<00:01:02.729> this<00:01:02.909> situation<00:01:03.540> I

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
I'm using less flaps in this situation I

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.890 
I'm using less flaps in this situation I
like<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> come<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.739> using<00:01:05.159> less<00:01:05.640> flaps<00:01:06.150> for

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like to come in using less flaps for

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
like to come in using less flaps for
greater<00:01:07.260> command<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.370> my<00:01:08.580> aircraft<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.299> my

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
greater command of my aircraft in my

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.320 
greater command of my aircraft in my
ailerons<00:01:10.049> effectively<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.460> landing<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
ailerons effectively when landing in a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
ailerons effectively when landing in a
crosswind<00:01:13.430> situation<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.790> thing<00:01:14.909> you're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
crosswind situation now one thing you're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.840 
crosswind situation now one thing you're
gonna<00:01:15.180> notice<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.049> teach<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.100> crab<00:01:17.460> on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
gonna notice too is I teach the crab on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.000 
gonna notice too is I teach the crab on
final<00:01:18.810> method<00:01:19.050> you'll<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.800> slight

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
final method you'll see there's a slight

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680 
final method you'll see there's a slight
crab<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.730> it's<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.000> too<00:01:21.300> much<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
crab in here it's not too much of a

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.320 
crab in here it's not too much of a
crosswind<00:01:22.230> I<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:23.250> teach<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> side<00:01:23.970> slip

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
crosswind I don't teach the side slip

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
crosswind I don't teach the side slip
method<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.440> way<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> final<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
method all the way out on the final we

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
method all the way out on the final we
do<00:01:26.400> side<00:01:26.670> slip<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> last<00:01:27.240> second<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.140> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
do side slip the last second but I don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
do side slip the last second but I don't
teach<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.580> final<00:01:30.060> why

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
teach it way out here on final why

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.570 
teach it way out here on final why
because<00:01:30.660> we're<00:01:30.870> low<00:01:31.080> we're<00:01:31.560> slow<00:01:32.010> we're

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
because we're low we're slow we're

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.210 
because we're low we're slow we're
adding<00:01:33.060> flaps<00:01:33.390> why<00:01:34.080> on<00:01:34.380> earth<00:01:34.410> would<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> want

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
adding flaps why on earth would I want

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
adding flaps why on earth would I want
one<00:01:35.580> wing<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> produce<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.630> lift<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
one wing to produce more lift in the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.280 
one wing to produce more lift in the
other<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.800> slip<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> very<00:01:39.180> advanced<00:01:39.810> maneuver

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
other a slip is a very advanced maneuver

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
other a slip is a very advanced maneuver
so<00:01:40.560> let's<00:01:41.010> stick<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.640> crap<00:01:41.970> method<00:01:42.570> for

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so let's stick with the crap method for

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.850 
so let's stick with the crap method for
now<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.050> right<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:43.230> we're<00:01:43.500> effectively

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
now so right now we're effectively

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
now so right now we're effectively
crabbing<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> little<00:01:44.910> bit<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.080> left<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
crabbing just a little bit to the left a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
crabbing just a little bit to the left a
little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.030> help<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.420> hold<00:01:48.690> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
little bit just to help us hold that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
little bit just to help us hold that
centerline<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.340> approach<00:01:50.730> touchdown

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
centerline and as we approach touchdown

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
centerline and as we approach touchdown
here<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.900> guys<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.260> see<00:01:52.440> we're<00:01:52.590> going

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
here that you guys can see we're going

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.140 
here that you guys can see we're going
to<00:01:52.770> show<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.070> touchdown<00:01:53.370> a<00:01:53.580> few<00:01:53.820> different

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
to show this touchdown a few different

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.840 
to show this touchdown a few different
ways<00:01:54.300> here<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.530> approach<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.190> touchdown

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
ways here as we approach this touchdown

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.820 
ways here as we approach this touchdown
we<00:01:57.330> simply<00:01:57.950> aileron<00:01:59.000> into<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.120> wind<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
we simply aileron into the wind and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.399 
we simply aileron into the wind and
apply<00:02:02.090> opposite<00:02:03.090> rudder<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.170> we're<00:02:04.380> coming

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
apply opposite rudder so as we're coming

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.410 
apply opposite rudder so as we're coming
in<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.159> enter<00:02:05.520> into<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:06.060> transition

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
in as we enter into that transition

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.559 
in as we enter into that transition
phase<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:08.159> I'm<00:02:08.340> doing<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:09.239> applying

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
phase what I'm doing is I'm applying

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.570 
phase what I'm doing is I'm applying
aileron<00:02:10.229> into<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> wind<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.489> bit

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
aileron into the wind and a little bit

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.220 
aileron into the wind and a little bit
of<00:02:11.640> opposite<00:02:12.090> rudder<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.510> maintain<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.989> sign

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of opposite rudder to maintain that sign

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.250 
of opposite rudder to maintain that sign
and<00:02:13.470> notice<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.760> upwind<00:02:15.360> wheel<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.870> left

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and notice that upwind wheel that left

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
and notice that upwind wheel that left
wheel<00:02:16.560> touches<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.610> first<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.180> notice<00:02:18.420> how

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
wheel touches down first but notice how

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
wheel touches down first but notice how
quick<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.140> we're<00:02:19.500> slowing<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.069> down

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
quick it is and we're slowing this down

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.339 
quick it is and we're slowing this down
here<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.940> super<00:02:21.569> slo-mo<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
here this is in in super slo-mo now so

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.420 
here this is in in super slo-mo now so
it's<00:02:22.439> not<00:02:22.499> your<00:02:22.620> computer<00:02:22.859> lag<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.249> watch

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's not your computer lag and watch

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.880 
it's not your computer lag and watch
that<00:02:23.639> far<00:02:23.969> left<00:02:23.999> wheel<00:02:24.889> see<00:02:25.889> how<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.219> touches

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that far left wheel see how that touches

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.130 
that far left wheel see how that touches
down<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.310> see<00:02:27.580> how<00:02:27.730> quickly<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:28.930> wheel

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
down and see how quickly the right wheel

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.380 
down and see how quickly the right wheel
follows<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.010> important<00:02:30.490> thing<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.030> to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
follows the important thing is just to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.440 
follows the important thing is just to
make<00:02:31.510> sure<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:32.050> upwind<00:02:32.620> wheel<00:02:32.940> touches<00:02:33.940> down

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
make sure that upwind wheel touches down

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.360 
make sure that upwind wheel touches down
first<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.440> lot<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.590> people<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:35.980> oh<00:02:36.069> I've<00:02:36.220> got

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
first a lot of people think oh I've got

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.770 
first a lot of people think oh I've got
to<00:02:36.459> hang<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:36.910> left<00:02:37.270> wheel<00:02:37.450> I've<00:02:37.569> got<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to hang it on that left wheel I've got a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.390 
to hang it on that left wheel I've got a
hold<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.140> I've<00:02:38.290> got<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> wheel<00:02:38.920> landing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
hold and I've got to do a wheel landing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.430 
hold and I've got to do a wheel landing
that's<00:02:39.520> not<00:02:39.760> necessarily<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> case<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:41.170> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
that's not necessarily the case all you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's not necessarily the case all you
want<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.860> make<00:02:41.890> sure<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.370> left<00:02:42.760> wheel<00:02:43.120> up

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
want to make sure is that left wheel up

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.210 
want to make sure is that left wheel up
when<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.780> touch<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.320> down<00:02:44.470> first<00:02:44.709> let's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
when we touch this down first let's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.110 
when we touch this down first let's
freeze-frame<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.820> here

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
freeze-frame in here

freeze-frame in here
frame<00:02:46.600> by<00:02:46.630> frame<00:02:46.840> watch<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.650> left<00:02:47.890> wheel<00:02:48.160> you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
frame by frame watch that left wheel you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.280 
frame by frame watch that left wheel you
can<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.209> right<00:02:49.660> there<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.050> see<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> little

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
can see right there you can see a little

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.930 
can see right there you can see a little
smoke<00:02:50.590> come<00:02:50.830> out<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.070> wheel<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.370> touch<00:02:51.640> down

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
smoke come out the wheel we touch down

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.680 
smoke come out the wheel we touch down
there<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.050> hold<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:53.980> out<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.310> left<00:02:54.760> main

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
there it is hold that out that left main

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.600 
there it is hold that out that left main

this<00:02:57.850> shots<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.150> little<00:02:58.390> bit<00:02:58.510> blurry<00:02:58.780> we<00:02:58.870> had<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
this shots a little bit blurry we had to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.240 
this shots a little bit blurry we had to
zoom<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.560> bit<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.070> kind<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
zoom in a little bit but just kind of

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.070 
zoom in a little bit but just kind of
showing<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> different<00:03:00.910> perspective<00:03:01.720> I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
