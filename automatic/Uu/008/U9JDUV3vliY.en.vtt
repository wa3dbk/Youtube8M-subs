to<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.760> metric<00:00:45.149> system<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to that metric system because it just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
to that metric system because it just
makes<00:00:46.980> more<00:00:47.160> sense<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.899> no
