00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so I'm going to get moving now I'm sure

they're going to show you while these
two<00:00:56.100> new<00:00:56.280> maneuvers<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.590> going

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
two new maneuvers are so let's go going

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
two new maneuvers are so let's go going
down<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> road<00:00:59.280> they're<00:01:00.000> both<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:00.359> basic

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
down the road they're both very basic

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.709 
down the road they're both very basic
both<00:01:01.109> quite<00:01:01.350> simple<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> nothing<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> worry

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
both quite simple so nothing to worry

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
both quite simple so nothing to worry
about<00:01:03.930> they're<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.589> probably<00:01:04.830> easier<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
about they're actually probably easier I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
about they're actually probably easier I
didn't<00:01:05.610> wanted<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> moment<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.140> two

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
didn't wanted to do the moment the two

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
didn't wanted to do the moment the two
maneuvers<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:07.979> being<00:01:08.189> dropped<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.760> fit<00:01:08.939> these

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
maneuvers are being dropped to fit these

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
maneuvers are being dropped to fit these
in<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> turning<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> mode<00:01:10.740> otherwise

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
in are the turning the mode otherwise

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.179 
in are the turning the mode otherwise
known<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> three-point<00:01:12.060> turn<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
known as the three-point turn and the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
known as the three-point turn and the
reverse<00:01:14.490> find<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> corner<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.450> reverse<00:01:15.720> find<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
reverse find a corner the reverse find a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
reverse find a corner the reverse find a
left<00:01:16.200> corner<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.549> new<00:01:17.729> maneuvers

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
left corner so the first new maneuvers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
left corner so the first new maneuvers

a<00:03:09.510> suitable<00:03:09.840> gap<00:03:10.170> let's<00:03:10.410> see

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.090

going to drive into a parking bay like

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.600 
going to drive into a parking bay like
this

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
this

reverse<00:03:29.100> out<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.550> bay<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:30.720> quite<00:03:30.960> an

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
reverse out of the bay this is quite an

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.570 
reverse out of the bay this is quite an
easy<00:03:31.170> thing<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> do<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> problem<00:03:32.460> is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
easy thing to do but the problem is

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.010 
easy thing to do but the problem is
people<00:03:33.090> simply<00:03:33.480> don't<00:03:33.660> look<00:03:33.870> around

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
people simply don't look around

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.380 
people simply don't look around
attacking<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.680> FOB<00:03:34.860> servation<00:03:35.180> how<00:03:36.180> many

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
attacking the FOB servation how many

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.060 
attacking the FOB servation how many
times<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.930> nearly<00:03:37.200> been<00:03:37.350> killed<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.830> car

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
times have I nearly been killed in car

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.350 
times have I nearly been killed in car
parks<00:03:38.340> because<00:03:38.670> you're<00:03:38.850> walking<00:03:39.150> along

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
parks because you're walking along

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.960 
parks because you're walking along

especially in a supermarket carpark the
people<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.480> don't<00:03:42.570> look<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:43.590> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
people just don't look this go to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.220 
people just don't look this go to
reverse<00:03:44.070> back<00:03:44.610> up<00:03:44.850> oh<00:03:45.060> look<00:03:45.810> there's<00:03:46.050> someone

behind me why you've got to look

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.110 
behind me why you've got to look
everywhere<00:03:48.180> before<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:50.000> there's<00:03:51.000> not

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
everywhere before you go so there's not

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.610 
everywhere before you go so there's not

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
reverse but back up just even left a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.380 
reverse but back up just even left a
little<00:03:58.110> bit<00:03:58.550> but<00:03:59.550> watching<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> fun<00:04:00.240> doesn't

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
little bit but watching the fun doesn't

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.510 
little bit but watching the fun doesn't
get<00:04:00.600> too<00:04:00.780> close<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.170> blue<00:04:01.440> car<00:04:01.740> key<00:04:02.340> but

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
get too close to that blue car key but

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.930 
get too close to that blue car key but
she<00:04:02.730> fun<00:04:02.970> doesn't<00:04:03.270> swing<00:04:03.600> she<00:04:04.470> farming<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
she fun doesn't swing she farming and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.370 
she fun doesn't swing she farming and
there's<00:04:06.120> numbers<00:04:06.390> going<00:04:06.570> on<00:04:06.720> around<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.290> I'm

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
there's numbers going on around so I'm

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.360 
there's numbers going on around so I'm
pretty<00:04:07.470> good<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.140> do<00:04:10.370> you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
pretty good and then what you do you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.250 
pretty good and then what you do you
simply<00:04:11.700> move<00:04:11.880> off<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> two<00:04:12.900> minute

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
simply move off it's the two minute

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.740 
simply move off it's the two minute
pervert<00:04:13.560> think<00:04:13.800> what's<00:04:14.010> he<00:04:14.130> doing<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:16.280> okay<00:04:17.280> so

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
pervert think what's he doing so okay so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.449 
pervert think what's he doing so okay so
that's<00:04:18.750> always<00:04:18.930> do<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.440> then<00:04:19.739> two<00:04:20.100> simple

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that's always do it then two simple

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.570 
that's always do it then two simple
maneuvers<00:04:21.060> in<00:04:21.480> my<00:04:21.690> opinion<00:04:22.169> far<00:04:22.410> simpler<00:04:22.860> than

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
maneuvers in my opinion far simpler than

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.520 
maneuvers in my opinion far simpler than
the<00:04:23.730> many<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.000> us<00:04:24.120> at<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.300> very<00:04:24.419> place<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.410> if

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the many of us at the very place so if

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.200 
the many of us at the very place so if
anything<00:04:25.770> touch<00:04:26.400> your<00:04:26.640> mouth<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.880> tastes<00:04:27.150> a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
anything touch your mouth it tastes a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.180 
anything touch your mouth it tastes a
little<00:04:27.240> bit<00:04:27.540> easier<00:04:27.840> maybe<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.830> it'll<00:04:29.070> be

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
little bit easier maybe but it'll be

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.550 
little bit easier maybe but it'll be
more<00:04:29.340> realistic<00:04:29.669> not<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> best<00:04:30.990> example<00:04:31.140> day

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
more realistic not the best example day

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.920 
more realistic not the best example day
because<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.190> one<00:04:32.580> car<00:04:33.540> my<00:04:33.690> mind

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
because it was just one car my mind

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.050 
because it was just one car my mind
there's<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.229> curb<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.710> left<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.669> that's

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
there's a curb on the left but that's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.630 
there's a curb on the left but that's
what<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.479> like<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.130> we<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.340> know<00:04:38.520> exactly

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
what it's like and we don't know exactly

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.880 
what it's like and we don't know exactly
yet<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.570> precisely<00:04:40.050> had<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.500> gonna<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.800> these

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
yet it precisely had you gonna do these

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.010 
yet it precisely had you gonna do these
maneuvers<00:04:41.400> they<00:04:41.940> may<00:04:42.120> do<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.720> you've<00:04:42.870> got

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
maneuvers they may do it so you've got

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.050 
maneuvers they may do it so you've got
to<00:04:43.110> be<00:04:43.200> between<00:04:43.440> two<00:04:43.770> cars<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.640> just<00:04:44.850> don't

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
to be between two cars we just don't

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.480 
to be between two cars we just don't
know<00:04:45.180> yet<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:46.020> think<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.530> first<00:04:46.860> tests<00:04:47.460> of

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
know yet and I think the first tests of

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.670 
know yet and I think the first tests of
the<00:04:47.880> new<00:04:48.030> kind<00:04:48.330> are<00:04:48.510> being<00:04:48.660> done<00:04:48.900> at<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.500> end

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
the new kind are being done at the end

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.280 
the new kind are being done at the end
of<00:04:49.830> April<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.910> can<00:04:51.720> book<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.080> night

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
of April and you can book the night

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.719 
of April and you can book the night
that's<00:04:52.620> not<00:04:52.800> going<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:52.950> be<00:04:53.190> doing<00:04:53.370> into<00:04:53.640> the

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
that's not going to be doing into the
