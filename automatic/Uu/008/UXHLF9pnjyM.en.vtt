00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.080
 well-found friends of tuttoandroid 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.780
 montana and we are from week here in rome 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.700
 when to provide for west ham 4 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.850
 interesting positive because 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.249
 has a 5-inch HD display 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.669
 we then have glass gorilla glass 3d e 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.619
 processor cover opta core 1.5 g 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.279
 of the 13 smi understand if the camera on 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.739
 back with camera led flash 5 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.680
 megapixel on the front also with flash 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.239
 led and then we have the self flash 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.820
 16 gigabyte internal memory and dies 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.500
 2 gigabyte ram expandable function 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.750
 of memory up to 3 4 gigabytes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.079
 or they can use the same slot 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.579
 for a second sim last power 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.429
 we have two lounges so here they are 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.690
 in the center the power button on the part 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.600
 higher than the audio jack port 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.190
 3.5 mm on the left side of the barbell 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.339
 volume on the lower part of the micro door 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.839
 usb and speaker on the back nothing else 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.129
 in addition to the camera the second 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.570
 microphone between the emotion of the noises of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.999
 background 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.030
 the device and it appears to be 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:09.909
 optimized to give off little radiation 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.229
 it also has a body entirely in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.540
 aluminum so very nice a lot 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.729
 particular or very elegant student 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 as a network there is a layer practically 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.470
 above this shell in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.510
 aluminum on the narrow back wico e 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.310
 the display also appears to be of 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.780
 quality as you see the definition that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.160
 also not being high anyway 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.560
 turns out to be of quality is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.180
 the respective one is particularly beautiful 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.320
 obviously also a bit big unfortunately 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.060
 because the spaces have not been 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.870
 optimized this maybe a flaw that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 we can precisely quote this 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.000
 do not allow a simple one 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.100
 simple one-handed use 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.240
 month with two hands and learned 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.890
 definitely easy 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.619
 also the edge here starts already 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.060
 in fact short drifts that short 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 overall the ergonomics are beautiful 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.149
 perhaps it suffers a little for the rest 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.580
 I'd say that's all for now 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.590
 I post further comments and feedback 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.000
 when we will have we should try and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.490
 we can review for others 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.170
 details visit the whole 9.7 site where 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.220
 find the video preview article 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.630
 for the moment it is all a greeting
