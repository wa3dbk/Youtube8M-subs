00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
know so I have these Rhino ramps and you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.290 
know so I have these Rhino ramps and you
know<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.950> drive<00:01:25.250> slowly<00:01:25.550> up<00:01:25.850> onto<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
know just you drive slowly up onto the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.870 
know just you drive slowly up onto the
ramps<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.020> make<00:01:27.830> sure<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.070> car<00:01:28.250> secured<00:01:28.670> put

ramps and make sure the car secured put
it<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.090> gear<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.780> ebrake<00:01:30.050> on<00:01:30.290> all<00:01:30.500> that

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
it in gear have the ebrake on all that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.120 
it in gear have the ebrake on all that
stuff<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.170> pop<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.200> hood<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
stuff and so pop the hood here and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.030 
stuff and so pop the hood here and
you'll<00:01:35.030> see<00:01:35.120> your<00:01:35.720> dipstick<00:01:36.230> is<00:01:36.440> right<00:01:36.770> there

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
you'll see your dipstick is right there

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.650 
you'll see your dipstick is right there
and<00:01:37.310> then<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.550> oil<00:01:37.730> fill<00:01:38.090> cap<00:01:38.120> right<00:01:38.600> there

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
and then the oil fill cap right there

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.270 
and then the oil fill cap right there
very<00:01:39.110> easy<00:01:39.350> on<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.560> EcoBoost<00:01:39.920> everything's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
very easy on the EcoBoost everything's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.640 
very easy on the EcoBoost everything's
laid<00:01:40.430> out<00:01:40.580> really<00:01:41.000> easily<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.080> you'll<00:01:42.260> want<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
laid out really easily so you'll want to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.170 
laid out really easily so you'll want to
take<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> oil<00:01:43.159> cap<00:01:43.340> off<00:01:43.580> because<00:01:43.730> that<00:01:43.820> helps

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
take the oil cap off because that helps

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.270 
take the oil cap off because that helps
the<00:01:44.300> oil<00:01:44.480> drain<00:01:44.690> better<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:45.620> put<00:01:46.130> some

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the oil drain better and then put some

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.710 
the oil drain better and then put some
cardboard<00:01:46.580> underneath<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.150> car<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.540> way

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
cardboard underneath the car this way

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.330 
cardboard underneath the car this way
whenever<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.350> accidentally<00:01:48.830> spill<00:01:48.980> oil

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
whenever you accidentally spill oil

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.950 
whenever you accidentally spill oil
which<00:01:49.610> inevitably<00:01:50.090> happens<00:01:50.570> most<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
which inevitably happens most of the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.450 
which inevitably happens most of the
time<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.650> won't<00:01:51.800> have<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.159> worry<00:01:52.340> about

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
time you won't have to worry about

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.620 
time you won't have to worry about
getting<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.909> driveway<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.480> also

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
getting on the driveway and it also

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.149 
getting on the driveway and it also
prevents<00:01:54.260> your<00:01:54.380> back<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.710> getting<00:01:54.920> scraped

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
prevents your back and getting scraped

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.520 
prevents your back and getting scraped
up<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.760> you<00:01:55.880> want<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.090> buy<00:01:56.180> an<00:01:56.300> oil<00:01:56.479> catch<00:01:57.170> pan

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
up and you want to buy an oil catch pan

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
up and you want to buy an oil catch pan
here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
here

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.930 
here
that<00:01:58.320> has<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.010> mesh<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
that has a little mesh there so the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.000 
that has a little mesh there so the
drain<00:02:00.240> plug<00:02:00.450> doesn't<00:02:00.870> fall<00:02:01.110> into<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.440> thing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
drain plug doesn't fall into the thing

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.219 
drain plug doesn't fall into the thing
of<00:02:02.130> oil<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> also<00:02:03.150> need<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.510> 15<00:02:03.990> millimeter

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
of oil and you also need a 15 millimeter

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
of oil and you also need a 15 millimeter
socket<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.100> EcoBoost<00:02:05.580> for<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> drain

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
socket for the EcoBoost for the drain

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
socket for the EcoBoost for the drain
plug<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.100> can<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.490> wrench

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
plug and you know you can use a wrench

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.949 
plug and you know you can use a wrench
as<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> ended<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.810> using

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
as well which is what I ended up using

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
as well which is what I ended up using
but<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:10.950> everything's<00:02:11.250> way

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
but as you can see everything's way

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.559 
but as you can see everything's way
about<00:02:11.490> really<00:02:11.760> easily<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> oil

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
about really easily there with the oil

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.970 
about really easily there with the oil
filter<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> drain<00:02:13.590> plug<00:02:13.770> right

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
filter and then the drain plug right

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.610 
filter and then the drain plug right
there<00:02:14.130> at<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> bottom<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> oil<00:02:14.700> pan<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
there at the bottom of the oil pan and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
there at the bottom of the oil pan and
so<00:02:16.620> there's<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.640> wrench<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.390> use

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
so there's my little wrench and I use

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.290 
so there's my little wrench and I use
the<00:02:18.720> Box<00:02:18.959> side<00:02:19.920> there<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.760> gets<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> better

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the Box side there so it gets a better

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.500 
the Box side there so it gets a better
grip<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.680> had<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> real<00:02:23.490> struggle<00:02:24.090> because<00:02:24.390> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
grip and I had a real struggle because I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.210 
grip and I had a real struggle because I
had<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> dealership<00:02:25.320> perform<00:02:25.650> oil<00:02:25.800> changes

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
had the dealership perform oil changes

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
had the dealership perform oil changes
previously<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.000> must<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.270> really<00:02:27.720> put

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
previously and they must have really put

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
previously and they must have really put
this<00:02:28.050> stuff<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.440> tight<00:02:28.739> because<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.190> was<00:02:29.760> here

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
this stuff on tight because I was here

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.720 
this stuff on tight because I was here
for<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> while<00:02:31.050> trying<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.860> bust<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.430> bolt

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
for a while trying to bust that bolt

safely cooled off a little bit but

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.650 
safely cooled off a little bit but
that'll<00:02:40.709> help<00:02:40.800> loosen<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:41.910> people<00:02:42.209> say<00:02:42.420> I

because like I said it definitely gets

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.110 
because like I said it definitely gets
messy<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.989> there<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.110> go<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.709> said<00:03:14.280> shoots

waver other than I was expecting so and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.090 
waver other than I was expecting so and
as<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.700> flow<00:03:18.470> decreases<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.560> also<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.980> to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
as the flow decreases you also have to

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.830 
as the flow decreases you also have to
keep<00:03:20.280> adjusting<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:21.150> well<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.780> it

close-up and it slowly just kept

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.949 
close-up and it slowly just kept
dripping<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.640> it<00:04:16.910> was<00:04:17.030> doing<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.420> for<00:04:17.480> a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
dripping and it was doing this for a

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.490 
dripping and it was doing this for a
while<00:04:18.170> so<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.100> just<00:04:19.459> cleaned<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.299> off<00:04:20.480> as<00:04:21.290> best

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
while so I just cleaned it off as best

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.110 
while so I just cleaned it off as best
as<00:04:21.620> possible<00:04:21.680> after<00:04:22.280> about<00:04:22.370> 45<00:04:22.700> minutes<00:04:23.000> of

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
as possible after about 45 minutes of

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.330 
as possible after about 45 minutes of
its<00:04:23.270> slowly<00:04:23.480> dripping<00:04:23.960> out<00:04:24.200> there<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.740> then<00:04:25.310> I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
its slowly dripping out there and then I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.150 
its slowly dripping out there and then I
just<00:04:25.700> threaded<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.420> back<00:04:26.630> in<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.170> now<00:04:28.100> you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
just threaded it back in and now you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.530 
just threaded it back in and now you
don't<00:04:28.490> want<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.760> over<00:04:28.970> tighten<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.360> because

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
don't want to over tighten this because

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.730 
don't want to over tighten this because
it<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:29.750> definitely<00:04:29.870> screw<00:04:30.170> up<00:04:30.260> your<00:04:30.350> oil<00:04:30.440> pan

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
it can definitely screw up your oil pan

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740 
it can definitely screw up your oil pan
so<00:04:31.010> just<00:04:31.250> snug<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.670> up<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:32.030> know<00:04:32.150> pretty<00:04:32.480> good

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so just snug it up you know pretty good

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.020 
so just snug it up you know pretty good
and<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.890> know<00:04:33.980> actually<00:04:34.250> clean<00:04:34.670> everything

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
and you know actually clean everything

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.600 
and you know actually clean everything
up<00:04:35.120> well<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.860> then<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:36.980> can<00:04:37.010> move<00:04:37.220> on<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
up well and then we can move on to the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.150 
up well and then we can move on to the
oil<00:04:37.940> filter<00:04:38.270> which<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:39.950> said

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
oil filter which like I said

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.470 
oil filter which like I said
everything's<00:04:40.430> nice<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.610> easily<00:04:41.120> laid<00:04:41.300> out

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
everything's nice and easily laid out

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.300 
everything's nice and easily laid out
but<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.720> oil<00:04:41.960> filter<00:04:42.140> was<00:04:42.350> on<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:42.680> snug<00:04:43.040> too<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
but the oil filter was on so snug too I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.500 
but the oil filter was on so snug too I
don't<00:04:43.490> know<00:04:43.550> if<00:04:43.610> they<00:04:43.670> either<00:04:43.790> use<00:04:44.000> tools<00:04:44.300> or

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
don't know if they either use tools or

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.140 
don't know if they either use tools or
had<00:04:44.630> super<00:04:44.870> superhuman<00:04:45.620> strength<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.640> had

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
had super superhuman strength but I had

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.640 
had super superhuman strength but I had
to<00:04:47.270> end<00:04:47.480> up<00:04:47.600> buying<00:04:47.930> one<00:04:48.140> of<00:04:48.200> those<00:04:48.290> tools

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
to end up buying one of those tools

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.490 
to end up buying one of those tools
there<00:04:49.130> for<00:04:49.400> my<00:04:49.490> socket<00:04:49.910> wrench<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.180> loosen<00:04:50.720> it

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
there for my socket wrench to loosen it

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.530 
there for my socket wrench to loosen it
up<00:04:51.680> there<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.220> then<00:04:52.370> you're<00:04:53.210> going<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> want

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.420 
up there and then you're going to want
to<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.720> your<00:04:53.870> oil<00:04:53.900> catch<00:04:54.620> pan<00:04:54.950> ready<00:04:55.250> again

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
drip if you have an oil filter like the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.550 
drip if you have an oil filter like the
Mustang<00:05:01.340> where<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.700> upside<00:05:02.030> down<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.560> you

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
WRX I know a lot of those have it

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.320 
WRX I know a lot of those have it
right-side<00:05:07.370> up<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:07.820> have<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.970> worry<00:05:08.150> about

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
right-side up so you have to worry about

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.360 
right-side up so you have to worry about
this<00:05:08.480> but<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.840> oil<00:05:09.020> will<00:05:09.260> leak<00:05:09.470> out<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.280> you

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
this but the oil will leak out so you

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.460 
this but the oil will leak out so you
want<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.550> make<00:05:10.640> sure<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.540> know<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:12.290> let

and<00:06:38.990> you<00:06:39.110> definitely<00:06:39.230> don't<00:06:39.470> want<00:06:39.650> to

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
and you definitely don't want to

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.820 
and you definitely don't want to
overfill<00:06:40.160> it

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.620 

they<00:06:45.430> have<00:06:45.520> a<00:06:45.550> handy<00:06:45.820> little<00:06:46.000> thing<00:06:46.270> here<00:06:46.510> so

they have a handy little thing here so
you<00:06:46.690> can<00:06:46.810> see<00:06:46.930> how<00:06:46.990> much<00:06:47.140> you<00:06:47.320> pour<00:06:47.620> it<00:06:47.710> in<00:06:47.940> put

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
you can see how much you pour it in put

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:59.250 
you can see how much you pour it in put
in<00:06:49.060> almost<00:06:49.630> half<00:06:50.110> putting<00:06:50.650> some<00:06:50.980> more<00:06:51.220> here

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.350 

so<00:07:00.260> as<00:07:00.980> you<00:07:01.160> can<00:07:01.280> see<00:07:01.340> it's<00:07:01.820> not<00:07:01.970> all<00:07:02.180> the<00:07:02.330> way

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
so as you can see it's not all the way

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.850 
so as you can see it's not all the way
up<00:07:02.510> this<00:07:02.690> is<00:07:02.870> the<00:07:02.990> top<00:07:03.170> mark<00:07:03.440> that's<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.710> low

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
up this is the top mark that's a low

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.340 
up this is the top mark that's a low
mark<00:07:04.130> it's<00:07:04.670> in<00:07:04.880> there<00:07:05.060> pretty<00:07:05.090> good<00:07:05.480> but<00:07:05.930> it's

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
mark it's in there pretty good but it's

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.170 
mark it's in there pretty good but it's
not<00:07:06.500> all<00:07:06.680> the<00:07:06.740> way<00:07:06.770> up<00:07:06.860> to<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.070> top<00:07:07.310> we'll<00:07:07.940> put

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
not all the way up to the top we'll put

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.180 
not all the way up to the top we'll put
in<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.390> little<00:07:08.540> bit<00:07:08.720> more<00:07:08.930> but<00:07:09.410> you<00:07:09.980> know<00:07:10.070> we

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
in a little bit more but you know we

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:19.720 
in a little bit more but you know we
won't<00:07:10.340> put<00:07:10.580> in<00:07:10.700> the<00:07:10.790> whole<00:07:10.940> thing<00:07:17.950> so<00:07:18.950> it<00:07:19.220> looks

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
won't put in the whole thing so it looks

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.520 
won't put in the whole thing so it looks
a<00:07:19.820> little<00:07:20.060> more<00:07:20.390> full<00:07:20.720> now<00:07:20.870> so<00:07:20.900> I<00:07:21.200> think<00:07:21.320> we're

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
a little more full now so I think we're

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.090 
a little more full now so I think we're
good<00:07:21.680> there

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
good there

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.550 
good there
we'll<00:07:22.460> just<00:07:22.610> run<00:07:22.760> with<00:07:22.940> that<00:07:23.090> so<00:07:23.450> we'll<00:07:24.410> just

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
we'll just run with that so we'll just

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.840 
we'll just run with that so we'll just
turn<00:07:24.710> the<00:07:24.830> car<00:07:24.980> on<00:07:25.010> and<00:07:25.250> check<00:07:25.400> for<00:07:25.430> leaks

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
turn the car on and check for leaks

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.630 
turn the car on and check for leaks
all<00:07:26.600> right<00:07:26.870> so<00:07:27.140> make<00:07:27.380> sure<00:07:27.470> you<00:07:27.620> put<00:07:27.830> the<00:07:28.070> oil

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
all right so make sure you put the oil

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.310 
all right so make sure you put the oil
filler<00:07:28.970> cap<00:07:29.060> back<00:07:29.540> on<00:07:29.750> as<00:07:29.930> well<00:07:30.110> make<00:07:30.290> sure

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320 
filler cap back on as well make sure

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.180 
filler cap back on as well make sure
it's<00:07:30.470> obviously<00:07:31.100> on<00:07:31.190> nice<00:07:31.790> and<00:07:31.820> snug<00:07:33.190> checking

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190
