00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
more time to use it now at least a

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.770 
more time to use it now at least a
couple<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.500> months<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.010> I<00:01:38.910> just<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
couple more months and I just think I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
couple more months and I just think I
just<00:01:40.050> get<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> bad<00:01:40.560> job<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:40.980> I<00:01:41.010> should<00:01:41.160> do<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just get a bad job and I should do it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.930 
just get a bad job and I should do it
again<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:42.480> let's<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
again so let's get right into it the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.400 
again so let's get right into it the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
some glare there but yes it is the 135

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.370 
18 millimeters it is an F 3 point 5 and
you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.619> move<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.920> from<00:02:10.950> F<00:02:11.250> 3.5<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.240> f-22<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you can move it from F 3.5 to f-22 and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.610 
you can move it from F 3.5 to f-22 and
as<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.040> work<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.640> goes<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.940> F<00:02:15.120> 4<00:02:15.480> F<00:02:15.870> 4<00:02:16.350> point

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
as you work up it goes to F 4 F 4 point

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.199 
as you work up it goes to F 4 F 4 point
5<00:02:16.770> F<00:02:17.220> 5<00:02:17.670> F<00:02:18.030> 5<00:02:18.450> point<00:02:18.780> 6<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:20.190> 135<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.030> are

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
5 F 5 F 5 point 6 and at 135 you are

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.910 
5 F 5 F 5 point 6 and at 135 you are
locked<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.600> five<00:02:21.810> point<00:02:22.080> six<00:02:22.290> five<00:02:22.560> point<00:02:22.800> six

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
locked at five point six five point six

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
locked at five point six five point six
is<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.489> lowest<00:02:23.820> aperture<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.239> can<00:02:24.390> go<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
is the lowest aperture you can go and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.430 
is the lowest aperture you can go and
you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.380> go<00:02:25.470> from<00:02:25.650> five<00:02:25.830> four<00:02:26.010> six<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.610> 22<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
you can go from five four six to 22 so I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.830 
you can go from five four six to 22 so I
mean<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.340> theory<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.910> lens<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.330> not<00:02:30.510> very

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
mean in theory this lens is not very

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170 
mean in theory this lens is not very
good<00:02:31.050> for<00:02:31.290> low-light<00:02:31.769> work<00:02:32.100> or<00:02:32.459> any<00:02:32.640> work<00:02:32.970> in

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
good for low-light work or any work in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.690 
good for low-light work or any work in
low-light<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.959> general<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.769> because<00:02:34.830> it's

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
low-light in general just because it's

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.600 
low-light in general just because it's
not<00:02:35.940> gonna<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.750> perform<00:02:37.410> when<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.340> need

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
not gonna really perform when you need

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.699 
not gonna really perform when you need
it<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.090> low-light<00:02:39.540> especially<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.560> are

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
it to in low-light especially if you are

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.979 
it to in low-light especially if you are
shooting<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.190> lower<00:02:41.519> ISO<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.690> things<00:02:42.840> like

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
shooting at lower ISO and things like

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.280 
shooting at lower ISO and things like
that<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.670> keep<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:44.940> mind

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that so keep that in mind

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.500 
that so keep that in mind
but<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> nice<00:02:47.610> lens<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> can<00:02:48.360> also

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
but it is a nice lens as you can also

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.970

personally<00:06:51.400> for<00:06:51.580> this<00:06:51.729> lens<00:06:51.910> I<00:06:52.060> think<00:06:52.419> in<00:06:52.510> its

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
personally for this lens I think in its

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.659 
personally for this lens I think in its
optimal<00:06:52.960> performance<00:06:53.110> keep<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:54.039> ISO<00:06:54.400> below

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
optimal performance keep the ISO below

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.200 
optimal performance keep the ISO below
1600<00:06:55.570> and<00:06:55.900> shoot<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.470> nice<00:06:56.919> evening<00:06:57.310> evening

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
1600 and shoot a nice evening evening

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.690 
1600 and shoot a nice evening evening
like<00:06:58.419> daylight<00:06:58.960> as<00:06:59.169> it<00:07:00.010> gets<00:07:00.160> lower<00:07:00.310> than<00:07:00.610> my

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
like daylight as it gets lower than my

like daylight as it gets lower than my
step<00:07:01.000> up<00:07:01.090> your<00:07:01.180> ISO<00:07:01.599> 2000<00:07:02.500> 2500<00:07:03.120> 3200<00:07:04.120> is<00:07:04.270> the

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:04.419 
step up your ISO 2000 2500 3200 is the

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.029 
step up your ISO 2000 2500 3200 is the
