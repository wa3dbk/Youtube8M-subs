00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
remember just because a game is hard it

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.119 
remember just because a game is hard it
doesn't<00:03:56.780> make<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:56.930> bad<00:03:57.260> don't<00:03:57.680> get<00:03:57.859> me<00:03:57.980> wrong

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
doesn't make it bad don't get me wrong

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.479 
doesn't make it bad don't get me wrong
but<00:03:59.090> there<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.599> a<00:03:59.629> limit<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.139> and<00:04:00.500> this

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
but there is a limit to that and this

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.420 
but there is a limit to that and this
game<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:01.730> very<00:04:02.599> um<00:04:02.750> very<00:04:03.220> unfortunate<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.310> this

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
game is very um very unfortunate in this

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.330 
game is very um very unfortunate in this
regard<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.030> mean<00:04:05.930> sure<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:06.919> graphics

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
regard I mean sure the graphics

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.629 
regard I mean sure the graphics
improvement<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.239> nice<00:04:08.480> touch<00:04:08.750> but<00:04:09.639> the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
improvement is a nice touch but the

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.339 
improvement is a nice touch but the
difficulty<00:04:11.180> increase<00:04:11.450> was<00:04:11.599> definitely<00:04:12.169> not<00:04:12.290> a

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
difficulty increase was definitely not a

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.349 
difficulty increase was definitely not a
good<00:04:12.560> idea

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
good idea

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.569 
good idea

hmm<00:04:53.870> well<00:04:54.770> my<00:04:55.009> first<00:04:55.250> problem<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.000> certainly

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
hmm well my first problem and certainly

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300 
hmm well my first problem and certainly
one<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.810> biggest<00:04:57.169> changes<00:04:57.410> in<00:04:57.770> comparison

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
one of the biggest changes in comparison

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.920 
one of the biggest changes in comparison
with<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.460> Mega<00:04:58.639> Drive<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.150> addition<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.840> a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
with a Mega Drive is the addition of a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.589 
with a Mega Drive is the addition of a
loading<00:05:00.350> screen<00:05:00.970> seriously<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.120> loading

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
loading screen seriously a loading

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.960 
loading screen seriously a loading
screen<00:05:02.720> why<00:05:03.620> would<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> cartridge<00:05:04.340> based<00:05:04.520> game

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
screen why would a cartridge based game

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.300 
screen why would a cartridge based game
need<00:05:05.449> a<00:05:05.630> loading<00:05:06.050> screen<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.710> makes<00:05:07.190> no

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
need a loading screen it just makes no

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.700 
need a loading screen it just makes no
sense<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:08.750> music<00:05:09.110> quality<00:05:09.259> isn't<00:05:09.590> that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
sense the music quality isn't that

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.219 
sense the music quality isn't that
pleasing<00:05:10.160> either<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.789> mean<00:05:11.660> compared<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.050> the

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
pleasing either I mean compared to the

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.040 
pleasing either I mean compared to the
other<00:05:12.349> versions<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:12.830> course<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:14.630> gameplay

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
other versions of course the gameplay

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.870 
other versions of course the gameplay
itself<00:05:15.410> is<00:05:15.680> not<00:05:15.949> much<00:05:16.160> different<00:05:16.610> but<00:05:16.819> the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
itself is not much different but the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.240 
itself is not much different but the
controls<00:05:17.270> are<00:05:17.479> very<00:05:17.750> stiff<00:05:18.139> it's<00:05:18.800> hard<00:05:19.009> to<00:05:19.160> it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
controls are very stiff it's hard to it

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.670 
controls are very stiff it's hard to it
enemies<00:05:19.610> with<00:05:19.789> marbles<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.449> sometimes<00:05:21.319> you

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
enemies with marbles and sometimes you

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.439 
enemies with marbles and sometimes you
can<00:05:21.830> miss<00:05:21.949> your<00:05:22.099> targets<00:05:22.520> very<00:05:22.759> easily

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.790 

those<00:05:26.449> loading<00:05:26.840> screens<00:05:27.169> are<00:05:27.320> really

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
those loading screens are really

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.350 
those loading screens are really
starting<00:05:28.039> to<00:05:28.130> annoy<00:05:28.370> me<00:05:28.400> now<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:28.849> mean<00:05:29.090> why<00:05:29.330> are

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
starting to annoy me now I mean why are

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.390 
starting to annoy me now I mean why are
they<00:05:29.570> there<00:05:29.780> even<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.560> disk<00:05:30.800> based<00:05:30.949> versions

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
they there even the disk based versions

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.999 
they there even the disk based versions
of<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.580> game<00:05:31.729> load<00:05:31.910> faster<00:05:32.270> than<00:05:32.419> this<00:05:32.740> at<00:05:33.740> one

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
of the game load faster than this at one

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.620 
of the game load faster than this at one
point<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.490> decided<00:05:34.849> that<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.180> reason<00:05:35.539> the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
point I decided that the reason the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.060 
point I decided that the reason the
loading<00:05:35.930> screens<00:05:36.259> were<00:05:36.380> there<00:05:36.620> was<00:05:36.919> because

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
loading screens were there was because

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.129 
loading screens were there was because
the<00:05:37.280> game<00:05:37.460> was<00:05:37.610> huge<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.210> mean<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.990> other

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
the game was huge I mean the other

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.960 
the game was huge I mean the other
versions<00:05:39.530> added<00:05:39.800> new<00:05:39.919> levels<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.400> game<00:05:40.550> so

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
versions added new levels of the game so

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.129 
versions added new levels of the game so
this<00:05:41.090> one<00:05:41.270> might<00:05:41.419> have<00:05:41.479> something<00:05:41.810> new<00:05:41.960> as

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
this one might have something new as

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.120 
this one might have something new as
well<00:05:42.289> right<00:05:43.270> well<00:05:44.270> no<00:05:45.050> in<00:05:45.320> fact<00:05:45.800> they<00:05:46.099> even

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130
