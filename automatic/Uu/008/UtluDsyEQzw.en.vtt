00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because the time he's been there at the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
because the time he's been there at the
club<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.200> did<00:01:58.380> cause<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
club I'm you know it did cause us a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.789 
club I'm you know it did cause us a
little<00:01:59.009> turmoil<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.990> moving

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
little turmoil here and there but moving

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
little turmoil here and there but moving
forward<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.700> best<00:02:02.880> bet<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
forward I think the best bet with the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.690 
forward I think the best bet with the
passion<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> Rooney<00:02:04.469> brings<00:02:04.680> forward<00:02:04.979> with

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
passion that Rooney brings forward with

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
passion that Rooney brings forward with
the<00:02:05.820> captain's<00:02:06.180> armband<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:07.020> he's<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the captain's armband I think he's the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.790 
the captain's armband I think he's the
right<00:02:07.350> man<00:02:07.879> other<00:02:08.879> than<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.440> nine

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
right man other than that you know nine

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.880 
right man other than that you know nine
changes<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:12.120> nine<00:02:13.110> changes<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
changes I think nine changes in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
changes I think nine changes in
the<00:02:14.010> second<00:02:14.370> half<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.540> Ashley

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the second half I think that Ashley

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.220 
the second half I think that Ashley
Young<00:02:16.080> could<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.530> our<00:02:16.680> jerk<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.209> if<00:02:18.209> he's<00:02:18.990> not

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
Young could be our jerk out if he's not

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.050 
Young could be our jerk out if he's not
afraid<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.770> get<00:02:19.950> chalk<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.490> his<00:02:20.640> boots<00:02:20.819> a
