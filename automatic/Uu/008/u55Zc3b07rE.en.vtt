00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi my name is ulyana or ulala and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.250
 today we talk about the long-awaited me 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.070
 things about the movie moment that day before yesterday 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.559
 looked with my sisters and I honestly 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.139
 speaking in wild delight I was very afraid 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 which is actually like my sister however 2 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.670
 that after a very steep trailer 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 something not as cool will follow 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 for example, how did 1 part come about 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 starvation games but the film offered in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 In principle, I read all our expectations 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 the book and already from it I squealed but here 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.829
 so I really, really liked and from 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 I had about these feelings 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.660
 when some movies should happen 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.360
 such a moment right here that changes everything 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 what is happening then this glow appeared as 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.809
 sister's son 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 usually there or something because 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.920
 that no he did not read but Masha already 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 started searching for a book somewhere in the apartment 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 because I'm a girl we are before 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 offered to read but they are feeling 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 refused refuse and now everyone 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 above to read the book had disappeared we 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.859
 brought yesterday the whole apartment today 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 keep searching so could not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 find and as you probably already understood i am 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 delighted it turned out amazing 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 colonization for a staggering principle 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.750
 I have not read the books from the second part but 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.640
 here is the first part I like even 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.770
 more than just hungry games 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.549
 screen version turned out much better 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.560
 the soundtrack is just amazing the theme itself 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.369
 who wrote Hans Zimmer plus all sorts 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.619
 songs 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.200
 ellie goulding who played there like her 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.030
 name is pronounced i don't know i or balance 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 how the costume designers handed over 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.790
 All the fractions 1 Stich erased NOSTA 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.189
 little family shaylin vudley then not very 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.759
 cast member shailene woodley kate 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.610
 winslet 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.110
 and sends for tony goldduin whom i honestly 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.140
 saying did not expect to see because not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 knew that he was shooting me now if you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 You know I watch the series scandal and tony 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 Goldwin series scandal plays will have 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 united states of america which 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.200
 I have long wanted very, very 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 hit and generally great show 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 if you have not looked for it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.359
 see that I am on time with my author 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.179
 the disease swallowed the first two seasons 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.520
 Then another tile 3 Rich inspect 3 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.020
 coming out of the last episode I'm not 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.360
 expected to see an actor from the movie 20 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.750
 Alinka lost to Peter who also 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.310
 width for playing the film which we are with 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.720
 sisters are going to see near 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.269
 time because we had a trailer and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 now I want to read a book and a movie 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.459
 watch something big i think and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.680
 in general such as 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.660
 captured my mind now we are today 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 in the morning with my younger sister's Masha 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.180
 watched watched the trailer 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.190
 and just wants it all now 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.829
 revise Masha rush, jumps and says 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.120
 what to look to the top and she constantly 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:49.170
 search engines funny pictures for example from 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.150
 the trailer speak rather angry at the exit 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.280
 from the scandal support club 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.989
 and she ask why are you looking 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 so to me and you say beautiful there is not 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.889
 like a bunch of different options then 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.049
 because you are my sister anything 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.600
 it is generally very funny to me very 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.920
 I liked that the filmmakers 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.260
 stuck to the shot 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.389
 book veronica mouth dialogues are almost the same 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.370
 the very same events it's all beautiful 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.290
 really interesting beat not 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.750
 very close to the filmmaker in play 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.030
 chicago where are all these factions as 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.690
 looked like a city changed for 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.150
 the movie 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.859
 here it is very beautifully made to me 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
 will complete as a book adaptation 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.250
 like much more than 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 hunger games if the second part somehow 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.380
 even more winning seems on the background 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.419
 the first part is 1 hour hit and when 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.310
 we will see watched 1 part of the nozzle even 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.250
 I honestly fell asleep somewhere around 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.180
 in an hour 1 and then dry in the very 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.530
 late and probably I do not regret it 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.480
 video is coming to the end don't worry i am 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.370
 said quite a lot of things and not too much 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.450
 only but the result is very me 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.819
 I liked the movie very much 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.790
 the track below will enjoy the work of artists 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.549
 on costumes and decorations and I really want 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.079
 you Yes, and another item now I 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.330
 finally calm Shui can be taken 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.000
 behind 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.490
 viewing more accurately reading the second part 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.900
 the series because I was waiting for the release of the film 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.730
 to continue the tripod 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.290
 that's how it turned out so I don't 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.590
 I know that there will be I know that the king 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.750
 the king and how the whole series merged literally 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.090
 On the last pages of the 3 books I hope 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.340
 I won't end after that hit her 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.959
 as much as tony goldduin and i 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.220
 anyway hope you enjoy it 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.830
