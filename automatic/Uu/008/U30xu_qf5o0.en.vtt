similar<00:01:11.630> noises<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:15.170> devo

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.090 
similar noises just it's very much devo
kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.630> recycling<00:01:18.630> old<00:01:18.930> sounds<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
kind of just recycling old sounds and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.999 
kind of just recycling old sounds and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
always found about Devo is that their

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.450 
always found about Devo is that their
influence<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.380> lot<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.680> their<00:01:49.800> songs<00:01:50.070> seem

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
influence and a lot of their songs seem

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.350 
influence and a lot of their songs seem
to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.760> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.480> like<00:01:51.630> 1950s<00:01:52.470> girl<00:01:53.250> groups<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
to be kind of like 1950s girl groups and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.770 
to be kind of like 1950s girl groups and
rockabilly<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:57.150> know<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.660> know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
rockabilly and you know just you know

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.960 
rockabilly and you know just you know
modified<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.980> kind<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.250> electronic

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
modified with that kind of electronic

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.200 
modified with that kind of electronic
new<00:02:00.570> wave<00:02:00.840> sound<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.700> down<00:02:02.940> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
new wave sound but when you get down to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.080 
new wave sound but when you get down to
it<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> strip<00:02:03.720> away<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.370> know<00:02:05.520> synth

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it you strip away all the you know synth

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.530 
it you strip away all the you know synth
and<00:02:06.270> stuff<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.160> kind<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.640> does<00:02:08.880> follow

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
and stuff it really kind of does follow

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.270 
and stuff it really kind of does follow
the<00:02:09.869> formula<00:02:10.230> all<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> their<00:02:10.770> songs<00:02:10.980> follow

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the formula all of their songs follow

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.310 
the formula all of their songs follow
the<00:02:11.430> formula<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.660> kind<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.990> 50

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the formula of that like kind of 50

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.770 
the formula of that like kind of 50
sound<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.520> think<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:14.850> holds<00:02:15.270> true

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
sound and I think that really holds true

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.520 
sound and I think that really holds true

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
man mind games like those first five

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.560 
man mind games like those first five
tracks<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.580> dig<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.000> have<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.270> great

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
tracks like I really dig I have a great

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.330 
tracks like I really dig I have a great
time<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.050> think<00:02:46.320> some<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.010> second

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
time with I think some of the second

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.550 
time with I think some of the second
half<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> album<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.900> little<00:02:49.260> bit<00:02:49.410> more

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
half of the album is a little bit more

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.240 
half of the album is a little bit more
filler<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.280> little<00:02:50.790> bit<00:02:50.910> more<00:02:51.060> familiar

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
filler a little bit more familiar

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.080 
filler a little bit more familiar
although<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> should<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.700> noted<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
although it should be noted that

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.340 
although it should be noted that
probably<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> most<00:02:56.239> surprising<00:02:57.239> thing<00:02:58.200> on

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
probably the most surprising thing on

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.860 
probably the most surprising thing on
this<00:02:58.500> album<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.950> that<00:03:00.890> no<00:03:01.890> place<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.400> home

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
this album is that no place like home

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.050 
this album is that no place like home
features<00:03:03.870> piano<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.860> piano<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.760> string

features piano and piano and string

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.320 
features piano and piano and string
arrangements<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.190> it's<00:03:08.190> pretty<00:03:08.670> seamlessly

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
arrangements and it's pretty seamlessly

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.470 
arrangements and it's pretty seamlessly
integrated<00:03:10.050> into<00:03:10.500> kind<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.489> devo<00:03:11.850> formula

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
integrated into kind of the devo formula

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
integrated into kind of the devo formula
of<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:13.320> know<00:03:13.440> synthesizer<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.200> hard<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
of you know synthesizer and hard you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160 
of you know synthesizer and hard you
know<00:03:16.650> something<00:03:17.400> drums<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.330> guitar<00:03:18.989> and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
know something drums and guitar and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.600 
know something drums and guitar and
that's<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.470> other<00:03:19.530> thing<00:03:19.680> about<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.220> album

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
that's the other thing about this album

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.360 
that's the other thing about this album
is<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.840> guitars<00:03:22.200> are<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.130> big

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
is that the guitars are back in a big

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.690 
is that the guitars are back in a big
way<00:03:23.720> as<00:03:24.720> devos<00:03:25.530> career<00:03:25.920> progressed<00:03:26.430> they

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
way as devos career progressed they

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.540 
way as devos career progressed they
became<00:03:27.000> less<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.360> less<00:03:27.600> guitar<00:03:27.959> bass<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.739> you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
became less and less guitar bass and you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.699 
became less and less guitar bass and you
know<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.880> synthesizer<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.530> more

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
know more synthesizer and a more

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.729 
know more synthesizer and a more
electronic<00:03:32.420> sound<00:03:33.420> effects<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.080> leaps<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
electronic sound effects and leaps and

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.610 
electronic sound effects and leaps and
Blops<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.220> whatever<00:03:35.810> but<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> guitar<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.380> back

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

here in a really big way so this album

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.060 
here in a really big way so this album
probably<00:03:40.920> rocks<00:03:41.510> it's<00:03:42.510> hard<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.050> know<00:03:43.080> they
