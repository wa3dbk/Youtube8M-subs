on the end that we knew we would have to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.190 
on the end that we knew we would have to
because<00:01:19.640> Eric<00:01:20.210> oats<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.510> a<00:01:20.600> terrific<00:01:20.780> ain't

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
because Eric oats is a terrific ain't

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.740 
because Eric oats is a terrific ain't
Don<00:01:21.410> is<00:01:21.650> one<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.490> best<00:01:22.670> around<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.540> his

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
Don is one of the best around and his

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.170 
Don is one of the best around and his
team's<00:01:24.280> constantly<00:01:25.280> play<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.060> we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
team's constantly play like this so we

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.120 
team's constantly play like this so we
were<00:01:26.510> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.690> be<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.020> battle<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.620> don't

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
were going to be in for a battle I don't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.530 
were going to be in for a battle I don't
think<00:01:28.190> either<00:01:28.400> offensive<00:01:28.790> play<00:01:29.090> particularly

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
think either offensive play particularly

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.450 
think either offensive play particularly
well<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.350> thought<00:01:30.500> both<00:01:30.710> defenses<00:01:31.280> played

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
well but I thought both defenses played

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.310 
well but I thought both defenses played
terrific<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.240> was<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.390> tough<00:01:32.630> game<00:01:32.810> oh<00:01:32.960> god<00:01:33.290> I

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
terrific so it was a tough game oh god I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.750 
terrific so it was a tough game oh god I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
whole team effort you know we didn't

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.830 
whole team effort you know we didn't
play<00:02:03.830> well<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:04.310> offense<00:02:04.910> but<00:02:05.330> special<00:02:05.660> teams

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
play well on offense but special teams

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.150 
play well on offense but special teams
picked<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.170> up<00:02:06.229> defense<00:02:06.619> picked<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.890> up<00:02:06.979> and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
picked it up defense picked it up and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.650 
picked it up defense picked it up and
offense<00:02:07.729> made<00:02:07.910> plays<00:02:08.149> here<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.509> there<00:02:08.630> but

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
offense made plays here and there but

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.170 
offense made plays here and there but
you<00:02:09.500> know<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.860> think<00:02:10.340> once<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.729> get<00:02:10.880> everything

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
you know I think once we get everything

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.760 
you know I think once we get everything
together<00:02:11.480> working<00:02:11.840> right<00:02:12.080> will<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> would

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
together working right will be a would

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.400 
together working right will be a would
be<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> dominant<00:02:13.070> threat
