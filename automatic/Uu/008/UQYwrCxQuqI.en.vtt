like you know just the kind of street

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.529 
like you know just the kind of street

somebody else's kind of completely

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.059 
somebody else's kind of completely
oblivious<00:01:13.450> both<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.410> these<00:01:14.500> gentlemen<00:01:14.560> are

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
oblivious both of these gentlemen are

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.699 
oblivious both of these gentlemen are
oblivious<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.869> could<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.140> improve<00:01:17.380> about

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
oblivious what could I improve about

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.559 
oblivious what could I improve about
this<00:01:17.920> well<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.520> little<00:01:18.789> bit<00:01:18.940> left

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
this well it's a little bit left

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.690 
this well it's a little bit left
justified<00:01:20.229> it's<00:01:20.440> leaning<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:20.979> left<00:01:21.069> okay

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
justified it's leaning to the left okay

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.089 
justified it's leaning to the left okay
so<00:01:21.759> we<00:01:22.000> need<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.209> get<00:01:22.300> our<00:01:22.420> framing<00:01:22.720> better<00:01:23.099> the

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:24.099 
so we need to get our framing better the

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.370 
so we need to get our framing better the
shutter<00:01:24.340> speed<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.940> little<00:01:25.690> bit<00:01:25.810> slow<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
shutter speed is a little bit slow and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
shutter speed is a little bit slow and
what<00:01:26.530> I'm<00:01:26.649> guessing<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.310> edilberto

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
what I'm guessing is that edilberto

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.749 
what I'm guessing is that edilberto
maybe<00:01:28.810> really<00:01:29.800> took<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.190> quickly<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.550> move

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
maybe really took this quickly and move

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.210 
maybe really took this quickly and move
this<00:01:30.970> camera<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.840> can<00:01:31.869> see<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.470> don't<00:01:32.679> mind

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
this camera you can see I don't mind

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.999 
this camera you can see I don't mind
that<00:01:34.000> there's<00:01:34.209> a<00:01:34.270> little<00:01:34.450> bit<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.830> motion<00:01:35.830> blur

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
that there's a little bit of motion blur

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.499 
that there's a little bit of motion blur
in<00:01:36.250> here<00:01:36.520> okay<00:01:36.819> I<00:01:36.849> think<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.270> that's<00:01:37.420> really

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
in here okay I think that that's really

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.550 
in here okay I think that that's really
cool<00:01:37.959> but<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:40.090> should<00:01:40.630> be<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:41.140> main

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
cool but this should be this main

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.040 
cool but this should be this main
subject<00:01:41.979> here<00:01:42.130> should<00:01:42.280> be<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.429> lot<00:01:42.819> sharper<00:01:43.300> so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
subject here should be a lot sharper so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.839 
subject here should be a lot sharper so
you<00:01:44.140> need<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> faster<00:01:45.009> shutter<00:01:45.190> speed<00:01:45.580> maybe

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
you need a faster shutter speed maybe

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.359 
you need a faster shutter speed maybe
higher<00:01:46.179> ISO<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.869> nail<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.679> don't<00:01:48.250> worry

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
higher ISO to nail this and don't worry

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.740 
higher ISO to nail this and don't worry
about<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.670> little<00:01:48.970> bit<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.149> noise<00:01:49.239> and<00:01:49.479> street

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
about a little bit of noise and street

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.469 
about a little bit of noise and street
shots<00:01:49.989> that's<00:01:50.229> cool<00:01:50.759> minor<00:01:51.759> things<00:01:52.149> you<00:01:52.390> know

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
shots that's cool minor things you know

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.150 
shots that's cool minor things you know
cutting<00:01:52.780> off<00:01:52.959> the<00:01:53.110> feet<00:01:53.379> whatever<00:01:53.649> doesn't

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
cutting off the feet whatever doesn't

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.790 
cutting off the feet whatever doesn't
bother<00:01:54.280> me<00:01:54.489> that<00:01:54.610> big<00:01:55.209> a<00:01:55.450> deal<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.050> I<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.229> dig

bother me that big a deal and I do dig

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.040 
bother me that big a deal and I do dig
on<00:01:57.039> this<00:01:57.280> boca<00:01:57.580> back<00:01:57.910> there<00:01:58.179> nice<00:01:58.450> thick<00:01:58.810> black

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
on this boca back there nice thick black

on this boca back there nice thick black
and<00:01:59.259> white<00:01:59.440> moving<00:01:59.830> on<00:02:00.899> open<00:02:01.899> for<00:02:02.080> business<00:02:02.229> I

guess is a bird shop of sorts or a pet

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.889

I take a photo ninety percent of the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.190 
I take a photo ninety percent of the
time<00:02:23.500> there

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
time there

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.809 
time there
they<00:02:24.290> won't<00:02:24.470> even<00:02:24.650> care<00:02:24.980> or<00:02:25.310> you'll<00:02:25.489> be<00:02:25.730> able

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to snap it off before they even have a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.059 
to snap it off before they even have a
chance<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.340> react<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.840> would<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.560> just

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
chance to react I would like to just

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.949 
chance to react I would like to just
have<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> little<00:02:32.150> bit<00:02:32.360> closer<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
have you be a little bit closer to the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.839 
have you be a little bit closer to the
subject<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:33.739> otherwise<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.459> know<00:02:34.550> pretty

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
subject but otherwise you know pretty

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.229 
subject but otherwise you know pretty
cool<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:36.410> street<00:02:37.069> performer<00:02:37.519> yep<00:02:37.849> it's<00:02:38.150> a

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
cool a street performer yep it's a

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.240 
cool a street performer yep it's a
street<00:02:38.420> performer<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.470> think<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.010> there's

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
street performer I think that there's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.890 
street performer I think that there's
much<00:02:40.700> better<00:02:40.970> angles<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.569> had<00:02:41.750> of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
much better angles to be had of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.470 
much better angles to be had of
something<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:43.459> would<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.269> liked

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
something like this I would have liked

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.210 
something like this I would have liked
to<00:02:44.569> maybe<00:02:44.780> you've<00:02:44.930> seen<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.349> framed<00:02:45.739> against

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
to maybe you've seen this framed against

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.309 
to maybe you've seen this framed against
this<00:02:46.370> brick<00:02:46.670> wall<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.239> less<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.900> window

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
this brick wall and less of this window

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.410 
this brick wall and less of this window
over<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.590> there's<00:02:49.280> no<00:02:49.400> context<00:02:50.060> there's<00:02:50.299> no

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
over here there's no context there's no

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.100 
over here there's no context there's no
people<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:52.910> flat<00:02:53.269> for<00:02:53.599> my<00:02:53.720> for

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
people it's a little bit flat for my for

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.839 
people it's a little bit flat for my for
my<00:02:54.140> taste<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.890> little<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.310> fuzzy<00:02:55.819> I

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
my taste and it's a little bit fuzzy I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.490 
my taste and it's a little bit fuzzy I
don't<00:02:56.120> know<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.239> that's<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.540> focusing<00:02:57.049> thing<00:02:57.319> or

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
don't know if that's a focusing thing or

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.550 
don't know if that's a focusing thing or
just<00:02:57.530> because<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> iso<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.790> pushed<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.209> high

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
just because the iso is pushed so high

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.699 
just because the iso is pushed so high
um<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.730> watcher<00:03:02.299> well<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.110> know<00:03:03.260> who<00:03:03.560> are<00:03:03.620> we

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
um the watcher well you know who are we

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.800 
um the watcher well you know who are we
talking<00:03:03.860> about<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.310> dog<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.790> person<00:03:05.269> I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
talking about the dog or the person I

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.360 
talking about the dog or the person I
think<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.860> would<00:03:06.950> have<00:03:07.069> been<00:03:07.130> kind<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
think that it would have been kind of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
think that it would have been kind of
interesting<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.940> dog<00:03:08.120> were<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.660> focus

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
interesting if the dog were in focus

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.920 
interesting if the dog were in focus
right<00:03:09.410> here<00:03:09.880> because<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.299> dude<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.660> kind<00:03:11.870> of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
right here because this dude is kind of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.920 
right here because this dude is kind of
looking<00:03:12.200> away<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:13.220> think<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.180> framing<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.660> here

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
looking away I think the framing on here

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.900 
looking away I think the framing on here
is<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.049> little<00:03:15.200> bit<00:03:15.380> off<00:03:15.640> we've<00:03:16.640> got<00:03:16.790> these

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
is a little bit off we've got these

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.400 
is a little bit off we've got these
really<00:03:17.120> bright<00:03:17.420> distracting<00:03:18.290> reflections

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
really bright distracting reflections

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.800 
really bright distracting reflections
over<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.549> it's<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.360> kind<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.630> hodgepodge

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
over here it's just kind of a hodgepodge

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.569 
over here it's just kind of a hodgepodge
of<00:03:21.170> things<00:03:21.530> going<00:03:21.860> on<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.130> really<00:03:22.400> need<00:03:22.549> to

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
of things going on we really need to

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.970 
of things going on we really need to
rein<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:23.360> in<00:03:23.540> there<00:03:23.780> again<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.890> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
rein this one in there again it's a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.410 
rein this one in there again it's a
matter<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.250> getting<00:03:25.400> closer<00:03:25.730> maybe<00:03:26.030> going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
matter of getting closer maybe going

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.759 
matter of getting closer maybe going
around<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> side<00:03:27.049> taking<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.470> few<00:03:27.650> other

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
around to the side taking a few other

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.740 
around to the side taking a few other
shots<00:03:28.569> digital<00:03:29.569> photograph<00:03:30.380> II<00:03:30.620> okay<00:03:31.750> you

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
shots digital photograph II okay you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.710 
shots digital photograph II okay you
know<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.350> idea<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.450> again<00:03:35.450> I

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
know I like the idea of this again I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.000 
know I like the idea of this again I
think<00:03:35.900> maybe<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.380> little<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.829> lower

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
think maybe a little bit of a lower

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.660 
think maybe a little bit of a lower
angle<00:03:37.280> could<00:03:37.880> have<00:03:38.000> really<00:03:38.600> been<00:03:39.139> cool<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:40.400> I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
angle could have really been cool but I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.009 
angle could have really been cool but I
like<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.970> fact<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.510> got<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.810> guy

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
like the fact that you got this guy

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.390 
like the fact that you got this guy
who's<00:03:42.230> just<00:03:42.350> kind<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.680> chilling<00:03:42.950> out<00:03:43.130> over

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
who's just kind of chilling out over

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.449 
who's just kind of chilling out over
there<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.209> kind<00:03:44.359> of<00:03:44.480> works<00:03:45.459> all

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
there and that that kind of works all

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.229 
there and that that kind of works all
right<00:03:46.700> staring<00:03:47.859> well<00:03:48.880> we've<00:03:49.880> got<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> little

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
right staring well we've got a little

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.520

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
not that easy so you know again I think

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.650 
not that easy so you know again I think
that<00:04:01.100> what<00:04:01.310> you've<00:04:01.489> done<00:04:01.730> here<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:02.239> you've<00:04:02.420> met

that what you've done here is you've met
you<00:04:02.810> might<00:04:03.019> have<00:04:03.200> slowed<00:04:03.530> your<00:04:03.739> shutter<00:04:04.400> speed

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.000 
you might have slowed your shutter speed
down<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.150> point<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.810> think<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.380> need<00:04:06.739> to

bump<00:04:07.549> that<00:04:07.639> up<00:04:07.760> just<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.180> touch<00:04:08.359> when<00:04:08.630> you're

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720
