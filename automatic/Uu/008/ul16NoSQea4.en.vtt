 strel holland 32 16 and 17 may it's a good point we took advantage for 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.800
 take into account per year 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.259
 in front of her fans that she participates more in 25 years of career she who has me 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.820

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.250
 the average of a month of May that's been 25 years that's legit that's ok no no it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 must the parliament gave Monday night but this is not the case because 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.100
 his candidacy there I promised my fans want unlike the year 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.420
 last and clear and that I always keep my promises is when I 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 told them to drown 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.820
 according to stronger global growth in place of panic for 25 years this 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.860
 was happening 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 it's true that regularly barrel it's normal to continue from 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.140
 genres ask you not to be presented anymore I am my own pleasure 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.880
 also to be there again and exactly so what did you all vote for 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.750
 in autumn 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.360
 for the olympia in may 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.820
 karzai could still not pass young already old and this one has 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.649
 leads to a time when the times 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.079
 light and I gave new musicians who go far who will us 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:14.990
 to accompany 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.789
 guys with high energy york 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.389
 and I am very very proud of the team that accompanies me 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:24.829
 we will try to increase the chances have the most alain ways juppÃ© 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.389
 read a little bit about people while at the same time they will find my 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:30.559
 songs and women are used to what I would like is a but a little more 

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:31.420
 from America 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.429
 a few months I have it 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.220
 they attacked 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.570
 opposite spontaneous side this side joyful lurons 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.620
 and at the hague of 1954 so side 48 dollars 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.600
 which makes that the second or even go to another universe and we do the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230
 party and the Caen 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.340
 to all these brave 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.380
 been very marked 80s 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 cbd Thursday 22 July to that this activity 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.750
 in fact the problem is also that it was like a moment I had 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 the impression that I could 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.460
 during those 90s all 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.459
 the prospectus in which he concluded by then small outings of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.529
 relief and that nothing yet 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.680
 however, it must be recognized that people were very threatened 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.379
 a difficult race 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.189
 I propose to my songs 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.629
 I was constantly being told who knows that it does not work 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.579
 and you see it's true it's pretty similar the alzheimer idealist is 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.539
 not 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.930
 as for any reason 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.219
 casting side we always give you a little sports portraits star because 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.630
 that all 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.829
 maybe it's necessary than ever 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.180
 and because we do not have any sense it is ambition indeed in full rescue 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.699
 ambitions yes because you compare and each time it's the 80s I 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.269
 did not sing anything other than my own Corsican songs and 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.509
 shows everyone sings at three levels 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.759
 nevertheless it is subjective really a lot of manpower it took me 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.829
 leave why not try to be ready already aroused unanimously by 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.809
 these assange heats was in the process of 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.049
 to leave a little job like that a little nanterre tunnel that exists is 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.309
 more difficult and then 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.729
 and today I am being launched today in France like 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.149
 asked for the 80s 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.569
 I was part of the gunmen at the same time I like this action ago 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.479
 145 me 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.789
 the center of tunis 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.939
 I like it - serve no food 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.239
 comment from it's a camp 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.790
 without you we did not say it was too late Montreal - with a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.339
 energy and a very acoustic version 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.639
 % and why not 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.810
 effect she was beautiful like that so the request 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.199
 as I said do not miss the tapestry 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.619
 in fact you missed the song of the star ac or fruit
