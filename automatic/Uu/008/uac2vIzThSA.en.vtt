right<00:00:07.799> now<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:09.139> believe<00:00:10.139> at<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> most<00:00:10.860> we're

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
right now I believe at the most we're

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.120 
right now I believe at the most we're
probably<00:00:11.580> 20%<00:00:12.200> the<00:00:13.200> way<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.799> think

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
probably 20% the way there I think

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.420 
probably 20% the way there I think
there's<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> whole<00:00:15.389> lot<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:16.400> purchasing<00:00:17.400> power

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
once we have the Federal Reserve we can

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.399 
once we have the Federal Reserve we can
see<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.489> actual<00:00:59.790> data<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> what

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
see the actual data here and what

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.289 
see the actual data here and what
happens<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:02.070> lower<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.549> here<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> value

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
happens the lower line here is the value

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.939 
happens the lower line here is the value
of<00:01:03.330> all<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.720> gold<00:01:03.900> held<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> Treasury

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of all the gold held at the Treasury

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
of all the gold held at the Treasury
that's<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> total<00:01:05.670> value<00:01:06.060> measured<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that's the total value measured and so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's the total value measured and so
it's<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.370> ounces<00:01:08.370> times<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.270> price<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.380> gold

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's the ounces times the price of gold

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's the ounces times the price of gold
the<00:01:10.740> dollar<00:01:10.920> price<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.700> gold<00:01:11.910> so<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.660> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the dollar price of gold so that's the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310 
the dollar price of gold so that's the
entire<00:01:12.900> value<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.860> upper<00:01:14.130> line<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> value

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
entire value the upper line is the value

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560 
entire value the upper line is the value
of<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> base<00:01:17.700> money<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of all of the base money which is

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.220 
of all of the base money which is
basically<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.800> cash<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.550> circulation

basically the cash that's in circulation

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.320 
basically the cash that's in circulation
base<00:01:22.230> money<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> paper<00:01:22.980> dollars<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
base money is paper dollars it's the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
base money is paper dollars it's the
cash<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.870> circulation<00:01:25.020> plus<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:26.330> deposits

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
cash in circulation plus the deposits

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
cash in circulation plus the deposits
that<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> banks<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.230> at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> Federal

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
Reserve now all of those deposits are

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
Reserve now all of those deposits are
redeemable<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.960> cash<00:01:34.230> so<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.520> basically<00:01:35.970> all

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
redeemable in cash so it's basically all

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
ounce but the reason that I argue that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 
ounce but the reason that I argue that
you<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.250> include<00:03:02.570> outstanding

revolving<00:03:03.780> credit<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.380> base<00:03:04.650> money<00:03:04.920> is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
revolving credit in base money is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.550 
revolving credit in base money is
because<00:03:05.850> when<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.420> sign<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.930> credit<00:03:07.350> card

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
because when you sign that credit card

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
because when you sign that credit card
receipt<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.070> create<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.520> currency<00:03:08.880> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
receipt and you create that currency you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.480 
receipt and you create that currency you
pay<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> merchant<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.740> same<00:03:11.070> as<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.460> you

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
pay it to a merchant the same as if you

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.060 
pay it to a merchant the same as if you
had<00:03:11.580> paid<00:03:11.910> paper<00:03:12.270> dollars<00:03:12.810> those<00:03:13.710> dollars

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
had paid paper dollars those dollars

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.880 
had paid paper dollars those dollars
stay<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.700> circulation<00:03:15.540> until<00:03:15.750> somebody<00:03:16.590> saves

stay in circulation until somebody saves

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
stay in circulation until somebody saves
them<00:03:17.070> up<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.370> pays<00:03:17.550> down<00:03:17.760> credit<00:03:18.060> card<00:03:18.390> debt
