00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that the snow is falling Southwest a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.280 
that the snow is falling Southwest a
burger<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.790> an<00:00:32.790> extremely<00:00:33.360> rare<00:00:33.540> phenomenon

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
burger is an extremely rare phenomenon

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.990 
burger is an extremely rare phenomenon
that<00:00:34.739> we'd<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> term<00:00:35.399> factory<00:00:35.850> effex

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that we'd like to term factory effex

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
that we'd like to term factory effex
snow<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.750> saw<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> 3<00:00:37.380> inches<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.829> snow<00:00:38.070> slick

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
snow we saw up to 3 inches of snow slick

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.709 
snow we saw up to 3 inches of snow slick
roads<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.820> localized<00:00:42.390> event

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
roads and this is a very localized event

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
roads and this is a very localized event
though<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.649> think<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.430> cause<00:00:47.610> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
though so we think that the cause of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.660 
though so we think that the cause of
this<00:00:47.879> has<00:00:48.090> been<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.890> maybe<00:00:49.890> even<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
this has been to maybe even more but

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
this has been to maybe even more but
possibly<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.420> these<00:00:51.539> two<00:00:51.920> factories<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
possibly just these two factories that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
possibly just these two factories that
have<00:00:53.250> been<00:00:54.410> producing<00:00:55.410> steam<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.800> part<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
have been producing steam as part of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.369 
have been producing steam as part of
their<00:00:56.129> day-to-day<00:00:56.480> routine<00:00:57.480> operations<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
their day-to-day routine operations and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.599 
their day-to-day routine operations and
that<00:00:58.410> steams<00:00:58.710> been<00:00:58.949> caught<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that steams been caught in the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
that steams been caught in the
atmosphere<00:01:00.920> over<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> last<00:01:02.219> 24<00:01:02.789> hours<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.470> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
atmosphere over the last 24 hours and it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
atmosphere over the last 24 hours and it
has<00:01:04.589> been<00:01:04.710> enough<00:01:05.070> extra<00:01:05.670> moisture<00:01:06.290> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
has been enough extra moisture to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
has been enough extra moisture to
produce<00:01:07.760> snowfall<00:01:08.760> downstream<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.689> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
produce snowfall downstream as we have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.120 
produce snowfall downstream as we have
northeast<00:01:10.170> winds<00:01:10.409> pushing<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> steam

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
northeast winds pushing the steam

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
northeast winds pushing the steam
downstream<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.360> snow<00:01:12.600> falls<00:01:12.869> out

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
downstream and then the snow falls out

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
downstream and then the snow falls out
of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> clouds<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> how<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
of the clouds so this is kind of how it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.460 
of the clouds so this is kind of how it
works<00:01:15.360> we've<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> heat<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.259> steam

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
works we've got the heat and steam

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.690 
works we've got the heat and steam
rising<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:18.119> factories<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
rising up from these factories and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
rising up from these factories and
contributing<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.630> already<00:01:21.780> saturated<00:01:22.200> air

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
contributing to an already saturated air

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.830 
contributing to an already saturated air
mass<00:01:22.920> noted<00:01:23.580> by<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.729> fog<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> freezing<00:01:24.450> fog

and frost that we'd been seeing all over

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
and frost that we'd been seeing all over
the<00:01:26.970> panhandles<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the panhandles but this was just a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.710 
the panhandles but this was just a
little<00:01:29.340> extra<00:01:29.670> kicker<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.270> needed<00:01:30.450> from

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
little extra kicker that we needed from

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.010 
little extra kicker that we needed from
a<00:01:30.810> moisture<00:01:31.140> standpoint<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:31.950> clouds<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.119> a

a moisture standpoint to get clouds in a

a moisture standpoint to get clouds in a
little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> snowfall<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.310> form<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> fall

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
little bit of snowfall to form and fall

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.289 
little bit of snowfall to form and fall
down<00:01:36.299> stream<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.170> case<00:01:37.970> buona<00:01:38.970> Vista

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
down stream and in this case buona Vista

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
down stream and in this case buona Vista
saw<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.770> majority<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> snow<00:01:41.130> with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
saw the majority of the snow with

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
saw the majority of the snow with
reports<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> three<00:01:42.119> inches<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
reports up to three inches so this is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
reports up to three inches so this is
what<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> looked<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.520> radar<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> snow

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
what it looked like on radar is the snow

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
what it looked like on radar is the snow
