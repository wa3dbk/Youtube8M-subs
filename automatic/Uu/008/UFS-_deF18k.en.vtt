in the shoulder where it sits here on
like<00:06:01.439> the<00:06:01.560> side<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:01.979> it<00:06:02.099> and<00:06:02.219> all<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.610> sudden

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
way to deal with that is that when you

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.820 
way to deal with that is that when you
see<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.210> hanger<00:06:06.629> have<00:06:06.900> like<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.199> chip<00:06:07.500> on<00:06:07.650> the

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
see the hanger have like a chip on the

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.129 
see the hanger have like a chip on the
side<00:06:08.069> of<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.400> where<00:06:09.089> the<00:06:09.180> hanger<00:06:09.509> is<00:06:09.659> supposed

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
side of the where the hanger is supposed

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.869 
side of the where the hanger is supposed
to<00:06:10.259> hang<00:06:10.469> stuff<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:11.189> can<00:06:11.370> take<00:06:11.550> clear<00:06:11.759> nail

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
to hang stuff you can take clear nail

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.519 
to hang stuff you can take clear nail
polish<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:12.539> put<00:06:12.719> that<00:06:12.870> on<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.110> little<00:06:13.229> site

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
polish and put that on the little site

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.649 
polish and put that on the little site
so<00:06:13.800> it<00:06:13.889> that<00:06:14.009> way<00:06:14.189> the<00:06:14.370> little<00:06:14.580> chip<00:06:15.270> doesn't

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
so it that way the little chip doesn't

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.719 
so it that way the little chip doesn't
stick<00:06:15.900> up<00:06:16.050> anymore<00:06:16.319> so<00:06:16.770> that<00:06:17.370> way<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.639> won't

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
stick up anymore so that way it won't

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.179 
stick up anymore so that way it won't
snag<00:06:18.060> close<00:06:18.330> as<00:06:18.599> much<00:06:18.810> I've<00:06:19.680> also<00:06:19.830> been<00:06:20.069> told

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
snag close as much I've also been told

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.829 
snag close as much I've also been told
this<00:06:20.339> works<00:06:20.580> for<00:06:20.789> glass<00:06:21.029> like<00:06:21.389> if<00:06:21.509> you<00:06:21.599> have<00:06:21.810> a

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
this works for glass like if you have a

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.869 
this works for glass like if you have a
drinking<00:06:22.500> cup<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:23.129> got<00:06:23.339> broken<00:06:23.789> or

drinking cup that got broken or

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.159 
drinking cup that got broken or
something<00:06:24.029> a<00:06:24.330> little<00:06:24.509> bit<00:06:24.629> or<00:06:24.750> it's<00:06:24.870> chipped

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
something a little bit or it's chipped

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.140 
something a little bit or it's chipped
on<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.439> side<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:26.279> can<00:06:26.310> put<00:06:26.639> this<00:06:26.729> over<00:06:26.909> so

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
on the side you can put this over so

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.429 
on the side you can put this over so
next<00:06:27.270> time<00:06:27.419> you<00:06:27.539> drink<00:06:27.689> it<00:06:27.870> doesn't<00:06:28.110> cut<00:06:28.259> you

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:28.439 
next time you drink it doesn't cut you

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:29.980 
next time you drink it doesn't cut you
because<00:06:28.589> it<00:06:28.680> kind<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.919> smoothes<00:06:29.159> it<00:06:29.310> out

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
because it kind of smoothes it out

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.119 
because it kind of smoothes it out
personally<00:06:30.990> if<00:06:31.199> I<00:06:31.289> have<00:06:31.469> a<00:06:31.500> chips<00:06:31.770> drinking

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
personally if I have a chips drinking

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.949 
personally if I have a chips drinking
glass<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.520> throw<00:06:32.729> it<00:06:32.819> away<00:06:32.909> just<00:06:33.029> because<00:06:33.360> but

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:33.959 
glass I throw it away just because but

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.020 
glass I throw it away just because but
maybe<00:06:34.680> this<00:06:34.860> is<00:06:35.009> an<00:06:35.130> option<00:06:35.550> if<00:06:35.819> the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
maybe this is an option if the

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.550 
maybe this is an option if the
like<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.210> really<00:06:36.390> special<00:06:36.870> drinking<00:06:37.230> glass<00:06:37.380> or

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
like a really special drinking glass or

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.040 
like a really special drinking glass or
something<00:06:37.860> maybe<00:06:38.820> it's<00:06:39.030> got<00:06:39.240> Snoopy<00:06:39.750> on<00:06:39.900> it

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
something maybe it's got Snoopy on it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.080 
something maybe it's got Snoopy on it
and<00:06:40.320> the<00:06:40.710> very<00:06:40.890> last<00:06:41.070> thing<00:06:41.370> is<00:06:41.400> your<00:06:41.640> buttons

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
and the very last thing is your buttons

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.240 
and the very last thing is your buttons
I<00:06:42.330> don't<00:06:42.480> know<00:06:42.540> about<00:06:42.690> you<00:06:42.900> but<00:06:43.170> all<00:06:43.920> the

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
I don't know about you but all the

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.400 
I don't know about you but all the
buttons<00:06:44.640> on<00:06:44.820> my<00:06:44.970> shirts<00:06:45.360> if<00:06:45.690> I've<00:06:45.900> worn<00:06:46.260> the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
buttons on my shirts if I've worn the

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.320 
buttons on my shirts if I've worn the
shirt<00:06:46.680> more<00:06:46.980> than<00:06:47.190> like<00:06:47.340> 50<00:06:47.700> times<00:06:47.880> those

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
shirt more than like 50 times those

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.600 
shirt more than like 50 times those
buttons<00:06:48.690> will<00:06:48.990> come<00:06:49.260> off<00:06:49.440> and<00:06:49.770> the<00:06:50.250> reason<00:06:50.370> why

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
buttons will come off and the reason why

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.070 
buttons will come off and the reason why
is<00:06:50.670> because<00:06:50.850> you<00:06:50.970> know<00:06:51.180> you<00:06:51.420> keep<00:06:51.780> on<00:06:51.930> using

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
is because you know you keep on using

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.600 
is because you know you keep on using
the<00:06:52.260> buttons<00:06:52.590> buttoning<00:06:53.010> unbuttoning<00:06:53.490> it

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
the buttons buttoning unbuttoning it

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.700 
the buttons buttoning unbuttoning it
gets<00:06:53.790> a<00:06:53.850> little<00:06:53.940> bit<00:06:54.120> thin<00:06:54.390> what<00:06:55.110> I<00:06:55.140> notice<00:06:55.590> is

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
gets a little bit thin what I notice is

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.680 
gets a little bit thin what I notice is
that<00:06:55.740> if<00:06:55.950> you<00:06:56.040> use<00:06:56.340> this<00:06:56.580> and<00:06:56.880> put<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:57.240> on<00:06:57.450> the

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
that if you use this and put it on the

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.140 
that if you use this and put it on the
buttons<00:06:57.990> like<00:06:58.140> the<00:06:58.350> strings<00:06:58.890> it<00:06:59.370> almost<00:06:59.850> like

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
buttons like the strings it almost like

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.110 
buttons like the strings it almost like
I<00:07:00.450> don't<00:07:01.260> know<00:07:01.320> it<00:07:01.500> dries<00:07:01.950> on<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.400> strings<00:07:02.820> and

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
I don't know it dries on the strings and

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.320 
I don't know it dries on the strings and
makes<00:07:03.390> them<00:07:03.660> a<00:07:03.690> lot<00:07:04.080> thicker<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.010> tougher<00:07:05.330> so

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
makes them a lot thicker and tougher so

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330 
makes them a lot thicker and tougher so
it's<00:07:06.510> like<00:07:06.690> making<00:07:07.110> string<00:07:07.620> into<00:07:07.920> super

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
it's like making string into super

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.850 
it's like making string into super
string<00:07:08.820> you<00:07:09.030> know<00:07:09.290> and<00:07:10.290> I've<00:07:10.380> noticed<00:07:10.560> my
