 Hello, my name is Dmitry 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.600
 Rethyunskih this is the third video clip 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.130
 wardrobes and in it we will answer 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.960
 questions of our customers 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.929
 the most common question is which fittings 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.280
 choose raumplus or aristo what you can 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.500
 say wardrobe 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.420
 It is quite an expensive purchase with 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 long service life and when choosing 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.800
 Fittings are always worth considering if 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.080
 meaning in saving a small percentage 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.650
 funds relative to the total amount 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.259
 of the contract 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.000
 raumplus system is a German company 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.200
 with its production in germany 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.329
 aristo system 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.430
 This is a Russian company with production 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.030
 in China on a double wardrobe compartment 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.420
 the difference in court will be from 8000 to 11000 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.760
 rubles 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.270
 depending on the length of the cabinet for three 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.430
 creativity from 11 to 16 for four target 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.160
 net from 15 to 20 thousand rubles 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.890
 accordingly, this is the difference in prices for 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.850
 which raumplus will be more expensive and now 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.190
 let's see 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.500
 is it worth saving our answer enough 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.109
 simple if funds allow 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.059
 it is better to choose raumplus if you are ready 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.379
 save then coming on quality 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.140
 accessories crown plus 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.240
 this is arist the next question is matt 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.330
 glasses and drawing on mirrors 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.310
 sandblasting now exists 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.260
 big enough for a proposal 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.930
 manufacture of compartment doors by mirrors 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.610
 decorated with sandblasting patterns or 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.710
 just mirrors labeled 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.050
 sandblasting methods we do not use 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.030
 similar mirrors in their production not 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.460
 recommend that you pay attention to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.620
 similar design thing is that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.870
 matting technology is 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.310
 Knocking out a squeak to you mirror and coating 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.140
 its surface is special 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.510
 modifying composition itself 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.340
 modifying composition extremely unstable 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.650
 and during operation this 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.900
 the coating is erased as a result in these places 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.640
 the mirror becomes open on such 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.320
 handprints remain on the cover 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 which is no way 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.180
 mother is no longer possible if for decoration 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.659
 interior required sandblasting 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.880
 picture 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.100
 then we suggest applying it with reverse 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.190
 side mirror or tinted glass 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.020
 what is called helped with the subsequent 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.810
 painting my paint is obtained 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.060
 the following effect in this case, the outer 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.620
 the side of the glass remains smooth not 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.580
 changes its qualities process 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
 operation 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 There is still such a type of glass matting 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.330
 like soccer at acid etched glass 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.670
 due to which the effect appears 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.530
 ground glass as opposed to glass 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.870
 sandblasted 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.000
 sapina there we continue working as 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.570
 the work surface is still the very 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 glass 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.950
 but either way the coating can 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.850
 be subject to mechanical 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.160
 damage 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 as a sandblast pattern replacement 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 we pickle we offer wide 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.580

 rei and drop tts glues this is new 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.530
 direction in the production of facades for 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.290
 furniture and interior design these panels 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.420
 resistant to moisture temperature extremes 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.400
 chemicals and other aggressive 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.590
 impact due to application 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 surround texture panel 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.540
 gets its stunning appearance 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.590
 I still want to say about training 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.659
 oracal films tinted glass 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.760
 these films make it possible 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.709
 wide choice of colors the same they 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.079
 distinguished by their low price 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.359
 on the glass with the film can often 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.579
 observe bubbles that may appear 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.620
 at hit of air at the time drawing 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.540
 film we refused to workout 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.129
 in a similar way and replaced it with 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.129
 better glass lacobel 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.620
 tinted glass lacobel 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.290
 production by applying paint on 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 back side glass paint due to 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.140
 staircase eliminates bubbles and 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.940
 creates an even flawless look often 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.860
 the question is asked how with minimal 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.650
 cost to make a wardrobe

 very simple the cheapest material for 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.450
 clearance is ldsp and mirrors 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.739
 inexpensive materials and dilute it 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.970
