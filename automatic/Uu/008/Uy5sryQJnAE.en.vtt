I<00:02:18.200> ever<00:02:18.290> did<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.560> YouTube<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:20.569> wasn't

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
I ever did on YouTube and I wasn't

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.520 
I ever did on YouTube and I wasn't
totally<00:02:21.769> satisfied<00:02:22.609> with<00:02:22.639> the<00:02:23.060> final<00:02:23.389> result

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
totally satisfied with the final result

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.050 
totally satisfied with the final result
there<00:02:24.740> are<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> lot<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.459> different<00:02:25.880> ways<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
there are a lot of different ways you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.740 
there are a lot of different ways you
can<00:02:26.480> do<00:02:26.660> Christmas<00:02:26.959> trees<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.630> although<00:02:29.630> I'm

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
can do Christmas trees and although I'm

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.830 
can do Christmas trees and although I'm
honestly<00:02:30.230> not<00:02:31.040> totally<00:02:31.850> happy<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.569> one

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
honestly not totally happy with this one

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.370 
honestly not totally happy with this one
either<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:34.360> definitely<00:02:35.360> like<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.569> better<00:02:35.870> than

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
either I definitely like it better than

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.640 
either I definitely like it better than
my<00:02:36.560> first<00:02:36.800> one<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:38.450> gonna<00:02:38.600> start<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.140> by<00:02:39.500> just

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
my first one I'm gonna start out by just

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.220 
my first one I'm gonna start out by just
drawing<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.430> series<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.959> these<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.440> my<00:02:42.620> nail<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
drawing a series of these on my nail and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.890 
drawing a series of these on my nail and
each<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.920> little<00:02:46.400> bit<00:02:46.580> wider<00:02:46.819> than<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.750> one

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
each one a little bit wider than the one

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.949 
each one a little bit wider than the one
above<00:02:48.640> kind<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> flattened<00:02:50.180> out<00:02:50.270> these<00:02:50.600> not

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
above kind of flattened out these not

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.400 
above kind of flattened out these not
really<00:02:51.260> sharp<00:02:51.590> fees<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.840> continue

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
really sharp fees and just continue

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.720 
really sharp fees and just continue
those<00:02:54.730> down<00:02:55.730> your<00:02:56.000> nail<00:02:56.620> till<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.739> get<00:02:57.950> close

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
those down your nail till you get close

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.870 
those down your nail till you get close
to<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.090> bottom<00:03:00.280> they<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.459> have<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.760> be

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
to the bottom they don't have to be

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.280 
to the bottom they don't have to be
perfect<00:03:02.390> just<00:03:02.920> kind<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.040> as<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> guide<00:03:05.290> where

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
perfect just kind of as a guide where

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.759 
perfect just kind of as a guide where
our<00:03:06.650> tree<00:03:07.160> branches<00:03:07.550> are<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.769> once

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
our tree branches are going to go once

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.309 
our tree branches are going to go once
that's<00:03:10.010> done<00:03:10.310> I'm<00:03:10.760> going<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.209> kind<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.840> connect

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
that's done I'm going to kind of connect

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.130 
that's done I'm going to kind of connect
them<00:03:13.569> kind<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.660> leafing<00:03:15.170> out<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.430> branches

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
them kind of leafing out the branches

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.740 
them kind of leafing out the branches
and<00:03:18.140> making<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.160> green<00:03:19.400> color<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:20.090> solid<00:03:20.630> in

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and making the green color more solid in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.820 
and making the green color more solid in
there<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:23.269> again<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.080> doesn't<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.769> be

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
there and again this doesn't have to be

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.280 
there and again this doesn't have to be
perfect<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.430> mean<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:25.670> look<00:03:25.910> in<00:03:26.060> nature<00:03:26.690> trees

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
perfect I mean you look in nature trees

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.930 
perfect I mean you look in nature trees
not<00:03:27.590> going<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.860> be<00:03:28.390> perfectly<00:03:29.390> symmetrical<00:03:30.940> so

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
not going to be perfectly symmetrical so

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.780 
not going to be perfectly symmetrical so
if<00:03:32.329> here's<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.720> little<00:03:33.140> bit<00:03:33.260> uneven<00:03:33.790> don't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
if here's a little bit uneven don't

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.830 
if here's a little bit uneven don't
worry<00:03:35.090> about<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:36.250> especially<00:03:37.250> because

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
worry about it especially because

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.539 
worry about it especially because
probably<00:03:38.840> everybody<00:03:39.739> else<00:03:39.950> will<00:03:40.190> not<00:03:40.340> notice

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
probably everybody else will not notice

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.020 
probably everybody else will not notice
even<00:03:41.060> though<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.450> seems<00:03:42.280> obvious<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.310> you

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
even though it seems obvious to you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.930 
even though it seems obvious to you
I'm<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.959> going<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.290> kind<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.310> rough<00:03:46.549> up<00:03:46.790> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
I'm just going to kind of rough up the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.890 
I'm just going to kind of rough up the
bottom<00:03:47.299> here<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.840> little<00:03:48.290> bit<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.890> not

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
bottom here a little bit so it's not

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.580 
bottom here a little bit so it's not
totally<00:03:50.900> inverted<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:53.720> fact<00:03:53.959> maybe<00:03:54.170> I'll<00:03:54.350> add

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
totally inverted in fact maybe I'll add

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.360 
totally inverted in fact maybe I'll add
just<00:03:54.859> one<00:03:55.489> more<00:03:55.519> layer<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.959> one<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:01.190> that

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
just one more layer to this one so that

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.120 
just one more layer to this one so that
it<00:04:01.519> gets<00:04:02.060> pretty<00:04:02.359> close<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.560> tip<00:04:03.799> of<00:04:03.980> my

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
it gets pretty close to the tip of my

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.440 
it gets pretty close to the tip of my
nail<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:06.019> there<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.769> see<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.820> Christmas

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
nail so there you can see the Christmas

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.810 
nail so there you can see the Christmas
tree<00:04:08.720> shape<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.870> add<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.620> bit

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
tree shape and just to add a little bit

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.319 
tree shape and just to add a little bit
more<00:04:13.820> interest<00:04:14.590> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.739> use<00:04:15.950> noubar<00:04:16.850> fire

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
more interest going to use noubar fire

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.450 
more interest going to use noubar fire
sparkle<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:19.180> I'm<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.510> put<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:20.660> some

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
lights or maybe you want to look at them

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.310 
lights or maybe you want to look at them
as<00:04:24.650> ornaments

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
as ornaments

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.370 
as ornaments
whichever<00:04:27.320> some<00:04:27.860> little<00:04:28.100> red<00:04:28.460> dots<00:04:29.380> just

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
going to use my smallest dotting tool

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.290 
going to use my smallest dotting tool
and<00:04:35.380> quickly<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.919> dot<00:04:37.190> them<00:04:37.400> onto<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.849> tree

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.910 

try<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.360> be<00:04:41.540> a<00:04:41.570> little<00:04:41.840> bit<00:04:42.020> random<00:04:42.530> which<00:04:42.710> is

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
try to be a little bit random which is

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.780 
try to be a little bit random which is
maybe<00:04:43.610> not<00:04:43.880> my<00:04:44.090> strongest<00:04:44.630> suit<00:04:45.140> I<00:04:45.790> like

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
maybe not my strongest suit I like

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.270 
maybe not my strongest suit I like
things<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.500> really<00:04:48.500> neat<00:04:48.680> most<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
things to be really neat most of the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.020 
things to be really neat most of the
time<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:49.760> for<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.210> design<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:52.030> doesn't

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
time but for this design that doesn't

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.530 
time but for this design that doesn't
quite<00:04:53.210> work<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:55.210> there<00:04:56.210> we<00:04:56.330> have<00:04:57.430> some

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
quite work so there we have some

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.720 
quite work so there we have some
ornaments<00:04:59.540> or<00:04:59.960> lights<00:05:01.420> whichever<00:05:02.420> you<00:05:02.570> prefer

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
ornaments or lights whichever you prefer
