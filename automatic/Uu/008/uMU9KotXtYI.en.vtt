00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
span of time but I felt like a small

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
especially considering there is a decent

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
especially considering there is a decent
amount<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> characters<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> meet<00:00:55.379> as

interesting<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.930> main<00:00:58.230> grab

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
interesting as all that is the main grab

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
interesting as all that is the main grab
is<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.980> max<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.640> control<00:01:00.120> time<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.989> unknown

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
is that max can control time for unknown

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
is that max can control time for unknown
