ashore for physique enhancing science
it's<00:00:16.410> their<00:00:16.590> new<00:00:16.770> protein<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.699> came

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's their new protein that just came

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.109 
it's their new protein that just came
out<00:00:18.060> literally<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.779> week<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> I'd<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
out literally this week so I'd like to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.279 
out literally this week so I'd like to
go<00:00:21.300> through<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.840> comes<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.140> three

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
go through it with you it comes in three

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
go through it with you it comes in three
flavors<00:00:22.439> milk<00:00:23.039> chocolate<00:00:23.550> cookies<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> cream

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
flavors milk chocolate cookies and cream

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.589 
flavors milk chocolate cookies and cream
and<00:00:24.900> snickerdoodle<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.730> snickerdoodle

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and snickerdoodle the snickerdoodle

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
and snickerdoodle the snickerdoodle
and<00:00:27.930> I've<00:00:28.470> heard<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.949> haven't<00:00:29.250> tried<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> yet<00:00:29.910> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and I've heard I haven't tried it yet I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.580 
and I've heard I haven't tried it yet I
think<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.480> combination<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> sugar

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
think it's a combination of like a sugar

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
think it's a combination of like a sugar
cookie<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.160> cinnamon<00:00:32.790> bun<00:00:32.820> sort<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> deal<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
cookie and cinnamon bun sort of deal I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
cookie and cinnamon bun sort of deal I
think<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.010> had<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> snickerdoodle<00:00:35.520> before

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
think if you had a snickerdoodle before

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.479 
think if you had a snickerdoodle before
it's<00:00:36.090> supposed<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> taste<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.930> so

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
it's supposed to taste like that so

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
it's supposed to taste like that so
there's<00:00:38.489> 27<00:00:39.030> servings<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.840> here<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.260> 27

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
there's 27 servings in here so it's 27

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.180 
there's 27 servings in here so it's 27
scoops<00:00:41.219> each<00:00:42.059> scoop<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.079> 24<00:00:43.739> grams<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
scoops each scoop has 24 grams of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
scoops each scoop has 24 grams of
protein<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> I'll<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.930> through<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
protein and I'll go through the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.400 
protein and I'll go through the
breakdown<00:00:46.559> now<00:00:46.920> 110<00:00:47.879> calories<00:00:48.239> per<00:00:48.690> scoop<00:00:48.960> one

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
breakdown now 110 calories per scoop one

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
breakdown now 110 calories per scoop one
and<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> half<00:00:49.710> grams<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.129> fat<00:00:50.629> one<00:00:51.629> carbohydrate

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and a half grams of fat one carbohydrate

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.910 
and a half grams of fat one carbohydrate
of<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:53.219> less<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> gram<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
of which less than one gram is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
of which less than one gram is
carbohydrate<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.370> excuse<00:00:56.730> me<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.059> dietary

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
carbohydrate or excuse me as dietary

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
carbohydrate or excuse me as dietary
fiber<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> less<00:00:58.109> than<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.440> gram<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.649> sugars

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
fiber and less than one gram of sugars

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
fiber and less than one gram of sugars
and<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.239> probably<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> half<00:01:00.870> gram<00:01:01.140> each

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and so probably about a half gram each

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.310 
and so probably about a half gram each
and<00:01:01.620> 24<00:01:02.370> grams<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> protein<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.780> let's<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and 24 grams of protein so let's go

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
and 24 grams of protein so let's go
through<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> protein<00:01:04.949> blend<00:01:05.570> they<00:01:06.570> call

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
through the protein blend they call

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
through the protein blend they call
their<00:01:06.900> muscle<00:01:07.290> targeted<00:01:07.830> protein<00:01:08.250> blend<00:01:08.460> milk

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
their muscle targeted protein blend milk

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
their muscle targeted protein blend milk
protein<00:01:09.360> isolate<00:01:09.869> milk<00:01:10.619> protein<00:01:10.950> isolate<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
protein isolate milk protein isolate is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
protein isolate milk protein isolate is
20%<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:12.180> 80%<00:01:12.960> casein<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> nice<00:01:13.979> thing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
20% way 80% casein and the nice thing

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920 
20% way 80% casein and the nice thing
about<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.520> being<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> no<00:01:14.909> protein<00:01:15.270> isolate<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
about it being a no protein isolate is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
about it being a no protein isolate is
they<00:01:16.409> remove<00:01:16.799> most<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> lactose<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.330> fat

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they remove most of the lactose and fat

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
they remove most of the lactose and fat
that<00:01:18.720> comes<00:01:18.840> along<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that comes along with that so that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
that comes along with that so that
that's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.310> good<00:01:21.090> quality<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that's a good quality to have there and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.679 
that's a good quality to have there and
then<00:01:23.100> whey<00:01:23.310> protein<00:01:23.729> concentrate<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.509> which

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
then whey protein concentrate of which

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.219 
then whey protein concentrate of which
whey<00:01:24.960> protein<00:01:25.350> kinda<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.830> 80%<00:01:26.250> protein

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
whey protein kinda that is 80% protein

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.020 
whey protein kinda that is 80% protein
so<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.409> nice<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.220> add<00:01:29.549> leucine

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so that's nice and then add leucine

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.050 
so that's nice and then add leucine
peptides<00:01:30.829> it's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.009> trademark<00:01:32.400> form<00:01:32.850> called

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
peptides it's a trademark form called

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.170 
peptides it's a trademark form called
pet<00:01:33.329> form<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.130> I've<00:01:35.220> read<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.490> per<00:01:35.790> scoop

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
pet form so what I've read is per scoop

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
pet form so what I've read is per scoop
you're<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.570> 5<00:01:36.960> grams<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.710> leucine<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you're getting 5 grams of leucine and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
you're getting 5 grams of leucine and
the<00:01:38.520> reason<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.090> leucine

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the reason that they use leucine

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
the reason that they use leucine
peptides<00:01:40.200> rather<00:01:40.439> than<00:01:40.680> adding<00:01:40.860> free<00:01:41.400> form

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
peptides rather than adding free form

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359 
peptides rather than adding free form
leucine<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.450> their<00:01:43.439> thinking<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
leucine is that their thinking is is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.270 
leucine is that their thinking is is
that<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.540> truth<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.070> peptide<00:01:47.070> bond

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that or it's a truth that peptide bond

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.120 
that or it's a truth that peptide bond
amino<00:01:47.610> acids<00:01:48.000> absorb<00:01:48.630> better<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:49.409> free<00:01:49.860> form

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
amino acids absorb better than free form

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.249 
amino acids absorb better than free form
amino<00:01:50.399> acids<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.479> why<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
amino acids so that's why that's in here

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
amino acids so that's why that's in here
so<00:01:52.439> they've<00:01:52.590> added<00:01:52.920> enough<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> pep<00:01:54.210> form

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
so they've added enough of the pep form

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
so they've added enough of the pep form

particular<00:02:18.900> blend<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.350> protein<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.890> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
particular blend of protein is that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.150 
particular blend of protein is that
you're<00:02:20.520> getting<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.820> blend<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.560> slow<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> fast

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you're getting a blend of slow and fast

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.280 
you're getting a blend of slow and fast
absorbing<00:02:23.610> proteins<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.960> getting<00:02:25.200> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
absorbing proteins so you're getting a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.990 
absorbing proteins so you're getting a
fast<00:02:25.530> release<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.040> amino<00:02:26.280> acids<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> way

fast release of amino acids of the way

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
fast release of amino acids of the way
and<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.450> steady<00:02:27.720> release<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:28.410> the

and a more steady release with the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
and a more steady release with the
casein<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.820> you're<00:02:30.240> getting<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.540> combination

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

know<00:03:38.280> half<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.060> bottle<00:03:39.360> at<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.540> time<00:03:39.780> or<00:03:40.140> per

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
know half of the bottle at a time or per

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.760 
know half of the bottle at a time or per
day

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
day

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.400 
day
so<00:03:41.220> that's<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.520> something<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.880> worry<00:03:42.150> about

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
so that's not something to worry about

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.660 
so that's not something to worry about
those<00:03:43.410> regards<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.800> taste<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.160> haven't<00:03:44.520> tried

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
those regards to taste I haven't tried

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.540 
those regards to taste I haven't tried
it<00:03:44.850> they<00:03:44.970> literally<00:03:45.240> just<00:03:45.330> ended<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.870> us<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
it they literally just ended to us so I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.130 
it they literally just ended to us so I
haven't<00:03:47.850> been<00:03:48.030> able<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.300> try<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> book<00:03:48.750> from<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
haven't been able to try a book from the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.480 
haven't been able to try a book from the
reviews<00:03:49.500> I've<00:03:49.680> seen<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:49.980> far<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.280> it's

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
reviews I've seen so far is that it's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.610 
reviews I've seen so far is that it's
very<00:03:50.670> good<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.690> know<00:03:51.750> they<00:03:51.990> put<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.200> lot<00:03:52.410> into

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
very good and I know they put a lot into

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.360 
very good and I know they put a lot into
flavoring<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> product<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.260> think<00:03:55.370> that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
flavoring the product so I think that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.699 
flavoring the product so I think that
just<00:03:56.880> about<00:03:57.060> covers<00:03:57.540> it

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
just about covers it

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.220 
just about covers it
and<00:03:59.130> for<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> people<00:04:00.390> out<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:00.570> who<00:04:00.810> may<00:04:00.990> say

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and for the people out there who may say

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.260 
and for the people out there who may say
you<00:04:01.680> know<00:04:01.709> are<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> leucine<00:04:02.730> added<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.240> a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
you know are is a leucine added as a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.810 
you know are is a leucine added as a
filler<00:04:03.600> things<00:04:03.990> like<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.260> know<00:04:04.820> they're

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
filler things like that know they're

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.060 
filler things like that know they're
adding<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.330> here<00:04:06.480> for<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.870> muscle<00:04:07.620> protein

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
adding it in here for the muscle protein

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.220 
adding it in here for the muscle protein
synthesis<00:04:08.670> aspect<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.480> there<00:04:09.900> are<00:04:10.050> no

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
synthesis aspect of it there are no

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.170 
synthesis aspect of it there are no
other<00:04:10.410> free-form<00:04:11.010> amino<00:04:11.220> acids<00:04:11.610> added<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.090> it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
other free-form amino acids added to it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.030 
other free-form amino acids added to it
and<00:04:12.330> plus<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.690> leucine<00:04:12.990> peptides<00:04:13.500> are

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
and plus the leucine peptides are

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.300 
and plus the leucine peptides are
peptide<00:04:14.790> bonding<00:04:15.240> they're<00:04:15.360> not<00:04:15.480> free<00:04:15.720> form<00:04:15.990> so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
peptide bonding they're not free form so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.590 
peptide bonding they're not free form so
while<00:04:17.310> they<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.580> count<00:04:17.790> as<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> part<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.510> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
while they do count as a part of the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.069 
while they do count as a part of the
protein<00:04:19.049> they're<00:04:19.590> not<00:04:19.830> free<00:04:20.130> form<00:04:20.370> amino

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
protein they're not free form amino

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.050 
protein they're not free form amino
which<00:04:21.199> is<00:04:21.349> nice<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.400> think<00:04:22.759> that<00:04:22.879> just<00:04:23.030> about

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
which is nice so I think that just about

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.520 
which is nice so I think that just about
covers<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.479> feel<00:04:24.080> many<00:04:24.259> other<00:04:24.379> questions

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
covers it feel many other questions

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.960 
covers it feel many other questions
you've<00:04:24.860> got<00:04:24.889> post<00:04:25.340> them<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.610> comment
