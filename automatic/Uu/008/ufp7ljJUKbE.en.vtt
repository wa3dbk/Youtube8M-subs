00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.149
 enjoy this wonderful view 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.520
 In this case we started to work the 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.220
 floor and lining so cute it was 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.259
 developed with a 20-year-old 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.520
 in fact I wanted to give them the merits 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.580
 because there were 370 plates placed in 15 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 days and then in 15 days to paint the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.020
 Ink is a super cool thing was one 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.090
 advice that we had from the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 The year helped us make this palette. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.390
 of colors 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.849

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.429
 Light green goes to see you gu and 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.509
 You finally have a surprise that he comes. 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.239
 and lemon 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.670

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:52.670
 enter here just looking at the land to super 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.560
 integrated we made the closet the bed and 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.770
 a bathroom all together 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.539

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.440
 market we have been doing a lot of 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.370
 people think I say it's a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:26.780
 different way of living that living a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:28.820
 more integrated toilet bowl 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.840
