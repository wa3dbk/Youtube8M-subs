00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
here there is also take a step back

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.889 
here there is also take a step back
actually<00:00:27.710> there<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.840> really<00:00:31.250> no<00:00:32.719> good<00:00:33.719> way<00:00:33.780> to

actually there is really no good way to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
actually there is really no good way to
explain<00:00:34.350> how<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.489> simple<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
explain how to do this it is so simple I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.889 
explain how to do this it is so simple I
mean<00:00:36.090> honestly

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
15 minutes no lie the pipes all come pre

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
15 minutes no lie the pipes all come pre
fitted<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.789> slip

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
there's a kind of a three-way there's a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540 
there's a kind of a three-way there's a
bee<00:00:53.850> flying<00:00:54.090> above<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.360> head<00:00:54.510> alright<00:00:55.550> sorry

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
okay so yeah there's a 3-way pipe there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
okay so yeah there's a 3-way pipe there
and<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> pipe<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> pipe<00:01:02.850> there

and a for a pipe there for a pipe there

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.530 
and a for a pipe there for a pipe there
and<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.140> goes<00:01:04.430> three-way

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
and it kind of just goes three-way

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.370 
and it kind of just goes three-way
three-way<00:01:06.540> three-way<00:01:07.460> 4<00:01:08.460> way<00:01:08.610> 4<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.360> 4<00:01:10.170> way

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
three-way three-way 4 way 4 way 4 way

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.990 
three-way three-way 4 way 4 way 4 way
and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> justa<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:11.939> of

and you get the justa but it kind of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
and you get the justa but it kind of
just<00:01:12.150> makes<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> outside<00:01:12.750> frame<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
just makes the outside frame this is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
just makes the outside frame this is
obviously<00:01:13.979> gonna<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> peak<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
obviously gonna be the peak so like I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.609 
obviously gonna be the peak so like I
said<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.530> took<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.390> maybe<00:01:18.390> 15<00:01:19.380> minutes

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
said this took me about maybe 15 minutes

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.749 
said this took me about maybe 15 minutes
max<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.250> set<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:21.299> super<00:01:21.659> simple<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
max to set up just super simple and this

meters by 3 meters and the 3 meters is
the<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:02.930> angled<00:02:03.930> pipe<00:02:04.170> pieces

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the is the the angled pipe pieces

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
the is the the angled pipe pieces
they're<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> same<00:02:05.969> shape<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.810> once<00:02:07.020> you

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
and then right now we're searching these

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.500 
and then right now we're searching these
nifty<00:05:31.570> little<00:05:32.250> clips<00:05:33.250> here<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.760> attached<00:05:34.330> at
