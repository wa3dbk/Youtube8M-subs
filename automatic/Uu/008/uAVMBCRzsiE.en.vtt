00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070
 crab salad 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.910
 I have a video on my channel how 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.680
 prepare this jairo salad here now 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.720

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.440
 shredded and contains mayonnaise and some 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.820
 things 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.510
 we wrap it with these fingers of this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.520
 way we win the banks and with these 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.549
 three of each hand we are pressing 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.760
 what you have inside to be able 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.940
 roll it up 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.940
 we have to roll it up to the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.190
 shore not at the end of the other so that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.980
 is something a segueta that is the one that goes 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.980
 to go around here and we roll it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.489
 We put in as little rice as possible 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.069
 there are places where they put too much rice 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.550
 but like this one is not to sell it for 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.210
 consume them us 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.210
 we are going to do it 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.900
 we put some slices of salmon 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.470
 more or less like that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:50.120
 we put a lemon juice to taste 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.120
 as she is well thin, she will give 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.720
 different flavor 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.650
 it's optional 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.140
 all right 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.140
 now it 's this fresh salmon for sushi 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.280
 from alaska we are going to put a little bit of 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.160
 goals and more roles 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.819
 so that our bamboo does not stick 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.239
 what he 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.090
 the fish is for hygiene too and for 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.269
 stop the sole owner we will 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.270
 press on the edges and with one of 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.790
 the fingers in the middle 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.990
 So if we press everything in the middle, 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.370
 what it contains comes out 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.370
 we press that square 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.390
 and ready here the area where we won 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:53.640
 in half in four parts and then to the 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:56.390
 half so that we have eight parts 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.390
 same 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.510
 and nothing else to put them on your plate 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.510
 where will they serve it? 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.700
