00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
imagine so I started practicing because

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.840 
imagine so I started practicing because
I<00:01:33.289> really<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:33.799> wanted<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.220> grow<00:01:34.610> as<00:01:34.819> a

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
musician and then kind of thought that I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.490

know just not as forthright um so he

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 
know just not as forthright um so he
just<00:02:04.069> gave<00:02:04.250> me<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.459> piece<00:02:04.819> kind<00:02:05.269> of<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.569> get<00:02:05.869> me

very<00:02:14.540> beginning<00:02:14.810> um<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.849> powerful<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
very beginning um is so powerful the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.690 
very beginning um is so powerful the
entrance<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> orchestra<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.550> then<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
entrance of the orchestra and then the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.309 
entrance of the orchestra and then the
entrance<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.300> violin<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.900> kind<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
entrance of the violin is kind of to

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.210 
entrance of the violin is kind of to
match<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:22.450> persona<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.349> just<00:02:24.650> really

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
match that persona and I just really

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.759 
match that persona and I just really
enjoy<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> third<00:02:26.959> movement<00:02:27.409> I

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
enjoy that and in the third movement I

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.740 
enjoy that and in the third movement I
mean<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.580> technicality<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
mean the technicality it's kind of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.229 
mean the technicality it's kind of
basically<00:02:30.140> 1a2<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
basically 1a2 than just all of the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.210 
basically 1a2 than just all of the
different<00:02:32.659> on<00:02:32.900> timings<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.769> go<00:02:33.890> into<00:02:34.069> it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
different on timings that go into it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:45.680 
different on timings that go into it
with<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> orchestra<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:35.239> really

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.060 

hopefully<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> most<00:02:46.990> challenging<00:02:47.710> part

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
hopefully the most challenging part

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.910 
hopefully the most challenging part
would<00:02:48.940> be<00:02:48.970> getting<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.900> strong<00:02:50.470> sound

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
would be getting that strong sound

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.550 
would be getting that strong sound
without<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:52.030> crunching<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.930> or<00:02:53.050> literally

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
without like crunching it or literally

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.160 
without like crunching it or literally
have<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.830> let<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.190> sound<00:02:54.490> be<00:02:55.330> produced<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:56.020> its

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
have to let a sound be produced on its

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.140 
have to let a sound be produced on its
own<00:02:56.380> with<00:02:56.590> your<00:02:56.770> own<00:02:56.890> weight<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.640> at<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.940> same

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
own with your own weight but at the same

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.350 
own with your own weight but at the same
time<00:02:58.360> when<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> get<00:02:58.930> so

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
time when you get so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.050 
time when you get so
get<00:02:59.660> some<00:02:59.840> energize<00:03:00.350> it's<00:03:01.010> easy<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.580> kind<00:03:01.970> of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
get some energize it's easy to kind of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.080 
get some energize it's easy to kind of
get<00:03:02.240> your

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.399 

kind<00:03:05.269> of<00:03:05.390> flow<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.050> should

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.780 

it's<00:03:12.409> just<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.709> technique<00:03:13.099> go<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.400> tell<00:03:13.549> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
it's just a technique go and tell that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's just a technique go and tell that
you<00:03:14.000> really<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:16.159> takes<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.519> lot<00:03:16.700> of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you really have to and it takes a lot of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.420 
you really have to and it takes a lot of
time<00:03:16.879> I<00:03:17.450> remember<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.230> mean<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.829> really<00:03:19.189> couldn't

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
time I remember I mean I really couldn't

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.089 
time I remember I mean I really couldn't
do<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.790> at<00:03:19.939> first<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.659> mean<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.290> does<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.829> like

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
do it at first I mean it does take like

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.679 
do it at first I mean it does take like
for<00:03:22.610> me<00:03:22.730> like<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.060> year<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.510> develop<00:03:28.689> the

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
for me like I year to develop the

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.069 
for me like I year to develop the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
concerto and what seemed to work best

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.750 
concerto and what seemed to work best
was<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.870> idea<00:04:57.350> of<00:04:57.500> Clare<00:04:57.800> playing<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.370> outer

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
Gayana Adagio in between them and that's

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:21.900 
Gayana Adagio in between them and that's
really<00:05:05.780> how<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.200> all<00:05:06.350> came<00:05:06.500> about
