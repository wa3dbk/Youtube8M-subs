00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.660
 where power steering friends cards 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.410
 news I'm good, I'm Marcelo, and today I 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.920
 I bring you here since 6s 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 heard since he expects to release her 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.199
 here I will accelerate 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.199
 I really owed video 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 where else 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 the business since it has six 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 is the suv of jac is Chinese bet and in the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.050
 in this segment also with what happened 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.050
 in these days 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 it is well served to start with the engine 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.740
 you could see the acceleration of the car 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.100
 It is very strict in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.370
 I really felt the car has strength 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.050
 it is the 2.0 flex 160 horsepower engine 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.740
 ethanol was held in the morning in the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.810
 gasoline and no two street team 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.230
 programs the launch of touch 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.250
 gasoline and 216 with ethanol 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.480
 size is a very strict and motor 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.480
 almost feels no weight 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 and also aided by the transmission 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.040
 mexican machico analog transmission 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.190
 nothing 11 gatti 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.659
 it's such a cool broadcast 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.640
 although it is the segment claim a 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.369
 automatic transmission 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.390
 this car here along with 2008 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.770
 honestly it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.060
 but are of similar segments 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.850
 they do not have automatic transmission 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.150
 normal 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.500
 but not much with this car he has a 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.860
 very strict touch so you can 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 reach all 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 few exchanges of gear buys who 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.980
 print soso 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.500
 his father is a good performance car 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.220
 the question of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.069
 his dynamic behavior the direction 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.760
 here is very light and direct 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.810
 It's something you do not expect a month under 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.150
 driving so fast 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.220
 and here combined the suspension 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.800
 in the back of a 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.569
 calibration of the buffers much more 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.110
 that's what we could 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.590
 Expect this car has a great time. 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.769
 dynamic behavior curves it is that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.230
 It's okay, I did not get to see the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.860
 car on the border opens the opportunity but 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.659
 it has good stability registered 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.670
 any other situation you will also 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.580
 be read with that car 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.790
 and 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.350
 counterpart of the hard suspension is 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.470
 that if you need to face the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.500
 corinthians daleh up by the height and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.990
 car proposal or even on asphalt 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.420
 but it is more difficult to be balanced enough 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.790
 behavior much better than the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.330
 first goal in the same war 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.850
 but nothing that bothers me so much 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.690
 It bothers us more, it's just for us to do. 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.950
 stolen a little more impetus 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.950
 something you would do with 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.700
 An adventurer at the bank, I want you. 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.990
 felt 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.020
 suspension of the patent 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.140
 and I think it's obvious that it's easy and 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.260
 run and sure that already that will stir 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.150
 in this for the next generation that there is no 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.920
 a good time since she 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.240
 you're always listening to it and you're 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.000
 listening 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.980
 A little boy rang in the car and this is a 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.060
 positive point 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.120
 who are here on the other in the engine he 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.510
 has the other consideration for the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.400
 performance of its high consumption 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.190
 I 'm here doing everything okay that I 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.860
 I did that celebration there but the average 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.720
 consumption on the road 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.820
 of EUR 9 6 10 per liter in gasoline 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.030
 and in the city as you take France if 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.820
 more caught 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.810
 he is doing around eight and a half 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.810
 we out there 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:46.750
 and after a little high 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.080
 it could be a little more 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.669
 restrained but it's the price you pay for 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 their performance 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.590
 for example here is fifth gear 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.650
 accelerate to take the car already 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.750
 responded pulls forward that's good 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.960
 overtaking the car was fine 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.260
 a great place for you to travel and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.120
 even in the day to day a car that you 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.120
 will take pleasure in driving 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.039
 the clothes for you here with a car 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.009
 stopped going to do an outdoor outlet is 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.590
 also an outlet from the interior here does not 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.580
 be with you other main 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.960
 Jack decides that she only knows the debate 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.099
 internal 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.580
 I with strong leads galera to the road of the 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.580
 arm
