computer<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> make<00:01:40.110> sure<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> inner

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
computer to make sure all the inner

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.990 
computer to make sure all the inner
workings<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> boat<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> go

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
workings of the boat are going to go

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
workings of the boat are going to go
together<00:01:42.210> properly<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:43.470> allows<00:01:43.799> them<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
together properly it also allows them to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
together properly it also allows them to
maximize<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.670> space<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
maximize a space and what does all that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.260 
maximize a space and what does all that
mean<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.860> translates<00:01:47.490> into<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.880> boat<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
mean that translates into a boat that is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.590 
mean that translates into a boat that is
precision<00:01:48.899> engineered<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.600> let's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
precision engineered just for you let's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
precision engineered just for you let's
go<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.079> boats<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.500> made<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
go see these boats get made so the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
go see these boats get made so the
computer<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> CAD<00:01:56.640> drawings<00:01:57.119> has

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
computer with the CAD drawings has

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
computer with the CAD drawings has
created<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.320> mold<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.610> means<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
created this mold and what that means is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.810 
created this mold and what that means is
a<00:02:00.210> precision-engineered<00:02:01.110> boat<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.100> good<00:02:02.549> mold

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
a precision-engineered boat a good mold

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
a precision-engineered boat a good mold
and<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> good<00:02:03.960> boat<00:02:04.200> something<00:02:05.159> else

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and you have a good boat something else

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.459 
and you have a good boat something else
we<00:02:05.460> also<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.210> nautique<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:07.079> create

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
we also do here at nautique is we create

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460 
we also do here at nautique is we create
our<00:02:07.649> own<00:02:07.680> frame<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.239> mold<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.319> in

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
our own frame for the mold what we do in

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.090 
our own frame for the mold what we do in
that<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
that is

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.720 
that is
create<00:02:11.340> something<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.970> easily<00:02:12.270> rotate

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
create something that can easily rotate

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.250 
create something that can easily rotate
so<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.760> there<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.060> an<00:02:15.180> even<00:02:15.540> distribution<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
so that there is an even distribution of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.600 
so that there is an even distribution of
the<00:02:16.650> gelcoat

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.970 

so<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.390> now<00:02:20.420> we've<00:02:20.750> got<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.110> gelcoat<00:02:21.650> going

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
so right now we've got the gelcoat going

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.580 
so right now we've got the gelcoat going
on<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.640> happens<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.300> three<00:02:23.630> fast<00:02:23.930> process

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
on it happens in a three fast process

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.760 
on it happens in a three fast process
after<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.490> first<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.090> second<00:02:26.840> path<00:02:27.050> they

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
after the first and second path they

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.290 
after the first and second path they
make<00:02:27.980> sure<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> thickness<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.970> just

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
make sure that the thickness is just

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.750 
make sure that the thickness is just
right<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.200> mill<00:02:30.410> gauge<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.310> ensured

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
right with the mill gauge that ensured

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.030 
right with the mill gauge that ensured
that<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> gelcoat<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.780> not<00:02:32.930> too<00:02:33.200> thick<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.770> too

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that the gelcoat is not too thick or too

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.060 
that the gelcoat is not too thick or too
thin<00:02:34.370> if<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.360> too<00:02:35.570> thick<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.410> boat<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.620> break

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
thin if it's too thick the boat is break

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.850 
thin if it's too thick the boat is break
easily<00:02:37.370> becomes<00:02:38.180> too<00:02:38.450> brittle<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.650> too

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
easily becomes too brittle if it's too

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.340 
easily becomes too brittle if it's too
thin<00:02:40.190> there's<00:02:40.730> no<00:02:40.970> strength<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.020> you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
thin there's no strength to it and you

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.040 
thin there's no strength to it and you
cannot<00:02:42.560> make<00:02:42.740> future<00:02:43.070> repairs<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.820> boat

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
cannot make future repairs to the boat

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.630 
cannot make future repairs to the boat
now<00:02:45.050> what<00:02:45.260> we<00:02:45.380> have<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.740> on<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:46.250> is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
now what we have going on right now is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.820 
now what we have going on right now is
the<00:02:46.850> deck<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.450> boat<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.870> getting<00:02:48.620> what<00:02:48.709> we

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the deck of a boat is getting what we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.360 
the deck of a boat is getting what we
call<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> skim<00:02:49.459> coat<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.660> use<00:02:50.810> any<00:02:51.370> 5,000

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
call a skim coat and we use any 5,000

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.240 
call a skim coat and we use any 5,000
skin<00:02:52.670> coat<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.240> best<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.660> business

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
skin coat it's the best in the business

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.400 
skin coat it's the best in the business
now<00:02:55.250> what<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.640> does<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:56.300> this<00:02:56.360> provides<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
now what this does is this provides the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.710 
now what this does is this provides the
max<00:02:57.650> amount<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:58.100> protection<00:02:58.390> between<00:02:59.390> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
deck of the boat and the gel coat now

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.180 
deck of the boat and the gel coat now
we've<00:03:02.930> also<00:03:03.110> got<00:03:03.380> all<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.590> noise<00:03:03.800> going

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
we've also got all this noise going

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.680 
we've also got all this noise going
around<00:03:04.430> because<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.150> what<00:03:05.390> we<00:03:05.420> call

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
around because we have what we call

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.020 
around because we have what we call
vapor<00:03:06.050> cooling<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
vapor cooling that's just for the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.180 
vapor cooling that's just for the
employees<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.570> be<00:03:08.690> more<00:03:08.900> comfortable<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:09.980> can

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
what we call pulling the boat that's

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.330 
what we call pulling the boat that's
where<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:49.719> separate<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.739> bold<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
where we just separate the bold and the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.879 
where we just separate the bold and the
whole<00:03:52.049> then<00:03:53.049> it's<00:03:53.200> going<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.379> move<00:03:53.530> into<00:03:53.680> this

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
whole then it's going to move into this

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.289 
whole then it's going to move into this
other<00:03:54.099> room<00:03:54.310> grindin<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.909> cutting<00:03:55.180> where

other room grindin and cutting where
they<00:03:55.419> trim<00:03:55.719> all<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.900> edges<00:03:56.409> off<00:03:56.590> from<00:03:57.219> there

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
they trim all the edges off from there

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.039 
they trim all the edges off from there
it's<00:03:57.909> going<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.180> move<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.510> next<00:03:58.599> area

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
it's going to move to the next area

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.959 
it's going to move to the next area
where<00:03:59.620> they<00:03:59.709> put<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.919> underwater<00:04:00.519> gear<00:04:00.790> on

where they put the underwater gear on

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.209 
where they put the underwater gear on
that's<00:04:01.840> what<00:04:01.989> we're<00:04:02.079> going<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.260> head<00:04:02.349> neck

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.920 

this<00:04:06.219> whole<00:04:06.489> has<00:04:06.669> been<00:04:06.849> trimmed<00:04:07.180> up<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.629> next

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
this whole has been trimmed up the next

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.390 
this whole has been trimmed up the next
step<00:04:08.109> is<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.349> put<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.739> up<00:04:08.799> into<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.099> air<00:04:09.129> like

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
step is to put it up into the air like

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.069 
step is to put it up into the air like
this<00:04:09.579> boat<00:04:09.819> here<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.329> have<00:04:10.900> all<00:04:11.049> the

chef's going to be coming out of the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.479 
chef's going to be coming out of the
engine<00:04:20.139> but<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.590> want<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.859> make<00:04:20.979> sure<00:04:21.009> that<00:04:21.370> we

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
engine but we want to make sure that we

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.310 
engine but we want to make sure that we
have<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.759> exact<00:04:22.180> that's<00:04:22.780> why<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> use<00:04:23.050> the

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
have that exact that's why I use the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.939 
have that exact that's why I use the
laser<00:04:23.530> pointer<00:04:24.039> like<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:25.590> what<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.770> does

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
laser pointer like this what that does

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.320 
laser pointer like this what that does
that<00:04:27.099> insurance<00:04:27.490> we're<00:04:27.759> going<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.120> that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
that insurance we're going to have that

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.600 
that insurance we're going to have that
chef<00:04:29.080> coming<00:04:29.380> out<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.830> just<00:04:30.159> the<00:04:30.370> right<00:04:30.550> angle

chef coming out and just the right angle

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.370 
chef coming out and just the right angle
that's<00:04:31.449> where<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> engine<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.080> going<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.320> be

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
that's where the engine is going to be

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.320 
that's where the engine is going to be
sending<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.770> shaft<00:04:33.039> out<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.370> boat<00:04:33.550> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
sending the shaft out of the boat the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.550 
sending the shaft out of the boat the
next<00:04:34.599> step<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.990> mount<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.409> engine<00:04:37.440> here<00:04:38.440> we

next step is to mount the engine here we

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.499 
next step is to mount the engine here we
are<00:04:38.710> getting<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.190> engine<00:04:39.550> mounted<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.270> fact

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
are getting the engine mounted in fact
