00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
actually what's here in the physical

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually what's here in the physical
world<00:01:54.140> amazing<00:01:55.140> things<00:01:55.410> happen<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> think

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
world amazing things happen and I think

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
world amazing things happen and I think
that<00:01:56.220> starts<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.790> catalyzed<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.330> lot<00:01:57.720> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that starts to really catalyzed a lot of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.030 
that starts to really catalyzed a lot of
creativity

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.520 

it's<00:02:03.850> been<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.600> know<00:02:04.690> it's<00:02:04.870> been<00:02:04.990> wonderful

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it's been you know it's been wonderful

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.249 
it's been you know it's been wonderful
to<00:02:06.400> see<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.760> our<00:02:06.880> audience<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.630> open<00:02:08.020> to

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
to see that our audience is so open to

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.109 
to see that our audience is so open to
hearing<00:02:08.560> from<00:02:08.740> brands<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.460> think<00:02:09.670> part<00:02:10.060> of

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
hearing from brands and I think part of

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.720 
hearing from brands and I think part of
it<00:02:10.210> is<00:02:10.330> if<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.570> think<00:02:10.780> about<00:02:10.869> tinder<00:02:11.730> you're

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it is if you think about tinder you're

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.880

going there to discover content like

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250 
going there to discover content like
there<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.340> there's<00:02:15.970> there's<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.570> really<00:02:17.050> an

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
there is there's there's not really an

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.550 
there is there's there's not really an
intent<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.510> you're<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.960> there<00:02:20.200> sort<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
intent and and you're just there sort of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.580 
intent and and you're just there sort of
digesting<00:02:22.410> Ren<00:02:23.410> what<00:02:23.830> feels<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:25.590> randomized

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
digesting Ren what feels like randomized

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.230 
digesting Ren what feels like randomized
information<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.490> think<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.210> great

any<00:03:23.500> quantity<00:03:23.980> outside<00:03:24.340> until

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
any quantity outside until

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.790 
any quantity outside until
um<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:26.480> think<00:03:26.780> we'll<00:03:27.110> announce<00:03:27.290> some<00:03:27.590> stuff

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
um I think we'll announce some stuff

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.140 
um I think we'll announce some stuff
around<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.220> soon<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:29.360> can<00:03:29.840> say<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:31.400> leaps

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
around that soon I can say it it's leaps

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.990 
around that soon I can say it it's leaps
ahead<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.960> where<00:03:33.410> what<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.250> sort<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.730> find<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
ahead of where what you sort of find the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.780 
ahead of where what you sort of find the
market<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:36.980> think<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> testament<00:03:37.490> to

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
market but I think it's a testament to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.080 
market but I think it's a testament to
how<00:03:38.000> engaged<00:03:38.750> are<00:03:38.960> audiences<00:03:39.320> they<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.550> they

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
how engaged are audiences they are they

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.150 
how engaged are audiences they are they
are<00:03:41.270> really<00:03:42.080> focused<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.680> content

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
are really focused on the content

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.610 
are really focused on the content
they're<00:03:43.310> having<00:03:43.670> fun<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:45.080> they're<00:03:45.290> engaged

they're having fun and they're engaged

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.590 
they're having fun and they're engaged
with<00:03:46.040> tinder<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.670> think<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.420> perfect

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
