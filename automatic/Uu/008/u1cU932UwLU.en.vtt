00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 In this video tutorial we will do 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.660
 the simplest game using the blend engine 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.700
 then switch to blender mode 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.700
 from our field camera and lamp 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.010
 let's raise the cube now for clarity I'm 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.640
 add one about what you will be very 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.269
 help when watching this video so 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.430
 so I added you see it appeared 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.790
 where the window will show that I click 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:42.570
 dumper nasty movements and so alignable 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:49.739
 its level we supply our 3d cursor 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 q in the center we add a plate on from 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:05.359
 nine and align now do our 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.359
 cu when I spared him a kind of Tay 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.920
 so here we insert at the end 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:31.200
 so here it is now 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:38.090
 let's push the bottom screen add editor 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 the logic of the keyboard 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:49.170
 ww 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:55.130
 close here go choose our from us 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.130
 goes here y minus y for moving forward 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 So 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.080
 add psinka new world, you can go 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.090
 in game mode letters about all of ours 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.239
 called character moves forward 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 then do gravity and physics 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.910
 solids 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.910
 now add the rest 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:55.670
 repeat this load only now 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:56.750
 do plus y now paris not 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.470
 right left 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.709
 we will have such not just as sharply 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:18.109
 right and well on the arrows we will do 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:23.569
 turn we connect everything in z 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:33.470
 we expose this object so on spam 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:36.040
 plus yes now check yes everything is correct 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.040
 a plus 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.280
 so let's continue now last 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.099
 options 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.900
 the first two change torture but as you can see 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:07.660
 already here here it was which 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:12.160
 moves your object the enemy add minus 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:16.389
 one is full of specifics movement 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.260
 ready game mode here is our character you can 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.790
 so to speak well let's call him so character 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:32.610
 moves like but we ask it 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:37.440
 direction now let's create physics for him 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:42.880
 the reception section of physics alone translate 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 add here is a tick and period this 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.419
 the parameter here is all left unchanged 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.419
 now add a couple more cubes 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.070
 here are given away 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.780
 faster 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.150
 initially now included the same magneto 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
 So 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.690
 now shelby 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.769
 So 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.500
 of this 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.500
 Now 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:01.460
 when we don’t just don’t pass 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:01.460
 game mode so succeeded 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.650
 you can push the cubes also hmm kindles 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.120
 different sizes add all sorts of masses 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.340
 opportunities they can be made so that 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.960
 they did not fall as the cubes in Tetris 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.960
 as a derivative 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.699
 So 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:55.970
 insert one cube for more seeding 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.970
 actions are added here so 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:09.889
 like that I think it will be enough and we bring down 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.250
 the most important thing is not to fall as well 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:24.040
 to make 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:26.470
 Any additions to the example so that 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.020
 the fall game ended or when the stock 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:34.300
 on the video any object 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:36.820
 the game ended on this all our 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.820
 the simplest game and create animation 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:43.240
 character ready to manage too so 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.150
 say more accurately see the following lessons 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.220
 how to create an enemy and so on 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.600
 example animation and rendering 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.600
 goodbye
