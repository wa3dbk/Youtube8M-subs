00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
with the club for 17 years and and I've

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
with the club for 17 years and and I've
seen<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.380> lot<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> teams<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.180> team<00:00:48.360> cares

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
seen a lot of teams here this team cares

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.459 
seen a lot of teams here this team cares
it's<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:51.079> little<00:00:52.079> bit<00:00:52.260> misguided

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it's it's just a little bit misguided

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.670

right<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.930> part<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.379> comes

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
right now and I think part of that comes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
right now and I think part of that comes
from<00:00:56.010> their<00:00:56.520> head<00:00:56.670> coach<00:00:56.989> dressing<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:59.210> they

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
from their head coach dressing and they

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.850 
from their head coach dressing and they
need<00:01:00.360> solid<00:01:00.750> leadership<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> top<00:01:01.680> from

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
need solid leadership from the top from

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.160 
need solid leadership from the top from
Stewie<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> Stewie<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> great<00:01:04.140> job

Stewie and I and Stewie does a great job
they'll<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.649> me<00:01:04.739> wrong<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.789> need

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
they'll get me wrong but they need

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.629 
they'll get me wrong but they need
hockey<00:01:06.630> players<00:01:06.929> need<00:01:07.340> decisive<00:01:08.340> leadership
