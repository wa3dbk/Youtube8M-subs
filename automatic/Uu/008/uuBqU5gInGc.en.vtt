00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
guys the back of the system so here it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.330 
guys the back of the system so here it
is<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.010> looks<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:22.340> there's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is that's what it looks like and there's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
is that's what it looks like and there's
a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.640> fan<00:00:23.820> vent<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> fun<00:00:25.109> fact<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.800> came

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
a little fan vent and fun fact this came

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.419 
a little fan vent and fun fact this came
from<00:00:26.220> an<00:00:26.369> Xbox<00:00:26.640> 360<00:00:27.420> fan<00:00:27.689> vent<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.740> case<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
from an Xbox 360 fan vent of the case I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.820 
from an Xbox 360 fan vent of the case I
don't<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:30.810> there<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
don't know where I got that but there it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.880 
don't know where I got that but there it
is<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:33.270> then<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.719> speaker<00:00:34.140> holes<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.710> I'm

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is and then to speaker holes and I'm

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.160 
is and then to speaker holes and I'm
using<00:00:35.070> cellphone<00:00:35.610> speakers<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.719> came<00:00:37.020> from

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
using cellphone speakers which came from

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780 
using cellphone speakers which came from
a<00:00:37.290> smartphone<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> they're<00:00:38.280> small<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.730> they

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
a smartphone and they're small and they

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.100 
a smartphone and they're small and they
have<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:39.030> quality<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.690> why<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> used

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
have good quality so that's why I used

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
have good quality so that's why I used
them<00:00:40.370> just<00:00:41.370> on-off<00:00:41.700> switch<00:00:42.110> screws<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> yeah

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
them just on-off switch screws and yeah

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
them just on-off switch screws and yeah
and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.300> here's<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> other<00:00:46.050> fan<00:00:46.320> bat<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and then here's the other fan bat right

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
and then here's the other fan bat right
there<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.700> where<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> air<00:00:48.329> blows<00:00:48.629> out

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
there and that's where the air blows out

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.090 
there and that's where the air blows out
and<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> cools<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> system<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:49.860> good

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and it cools the system pretty good

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
and it cools the system pretty good
which<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.280> cool

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
which is cool

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110 
which is cool
yeah<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.620> never<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:53.940> video

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
yeah I never really did a video

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.970 
yeah I never really did a video
explaining<00:00:54.810> the<00:00:55.080> envision<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.560> just<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
explaining the envision I just kind of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
explaining the envision I just kind of
had<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.550> log<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.210> did<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
had a work log and then did that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
had a work log and then did that
presentation<00:00:58.080> video<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.110> don't<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.380> maybe

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
presentation video so I don't know maybe

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.870 
presentation video so I don't know maybe
able<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.860> talk<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:02.250> system<00:01:02.580> a<00:01:02.640> little

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
able to talk about the system a little

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.970 
able to talk about the system a little
bit<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.810> it's<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.050> standard<00:01:04.199> GameCube

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
bit you know it's your standard GameCube

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.410 
bit you know it's your standard GameCube
it<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.250> doesn't<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.520> a<00:01:05.580> disk<00:01:05.820> drive<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it just doesn't have a disk drive and it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
it just doesn't have a disk drive and it
has<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> wiki<00:01:07.320> fusion<00:01:07.710> inside<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> which

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
has a wiki fusion inside of it which

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960 
has a wiki fusion inside of it which
allows<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.950> much<00:01:10.950> smaller<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.790> thinner

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
allows it to be much smaller and thinner

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.530 
allows it to be much smaller and thinner
and<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.420> comfortable<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.590> play<00:01:14.510> you<00:01:15.510> know

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and more comfortable to play you know

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.790 
and more comfortable to play you know

for brightness and toggling between VGA
and<00:01:31.619> video<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.660> we<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and video and then here we have the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
and video and then here we have the
power<00:01:34.710> port<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.910> charge

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
power port and then this is the charge

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
power port and then this is the charge
port<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> button<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.710> activates<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
port this is a button that activates the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
port this is a button that activates the
wiki<00:01:38.610> fusion<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.170> disk

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.770 
wiki fusion and then this is the disk
drive<00:01:40.800> switch<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.550> here<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.000> white<00:01:42.240> thing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
drive switch right here this white thing

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.050 
drive switch right here this white thing
and<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.590> right<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:45.130> have<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.730> headphone

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and then right here we have a headphone
