00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
to show it's going to be like doing at

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
to show it's going to be like doing at
level<00:00:11.130> 100<00:00:11.280> now<00:00:12.150> obviously<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.840> beta

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
level 100 now obviously this is beta

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
level 100 now obviously this is beta
right<00:00:13.530> now<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.160> things<00:00:14.700> could<00:00:14.910> change<00:00:14.969> but

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
right now and so things could change but

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.760 
right now and so things could change but
I<00:00:15.599> think<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> pretty

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I think this is going to be a pretty

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.519 
I think this is going to be a pretty
good<00:00:16.949> indicator<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> expect<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:19.140> if

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
good indicator of what to expect now if

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
good indicator of what to expect now if
you<00:00:19.650> guys<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.640> videos

yog fight you've pretty much got to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150 
yog fight you've pretty much got to
assume<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.289> shot<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.710> everything

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
assume it on one shot and everything

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
anyway even even the tentacles are just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
anyway even even the tentacles are just
going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> fucking<00:01:25.950> destroyed<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.729> guess

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
entirely sure but the Lich King was easy

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
entirely sure but the Lich King was easy
to<00:01:55.590> guys<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.430> even<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.850> day<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this was like probably a little bit

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.649 
this was like probably a little bit
easier<00:01:59.490> than<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> Lich<00:01:59.969> King<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> mean

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
easier than the Lich King but I mean

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
easier than the Lich King but I mean
honestly<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.290> comparing<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.430> don't

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
honestly it's comparing like I don't

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.200 
honestly it's comparing like I don't
know<00:02:04.070> did<00:02:05.070> did<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> both<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.060> were<00:02:06.180> just

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
