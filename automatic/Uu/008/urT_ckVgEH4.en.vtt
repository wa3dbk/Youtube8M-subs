lick number one is based around a minor
pentatonic<00:00:45.120> scale<00:00:48.230> we're<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:49.500> using

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
pentatonic scale we're pretty much using

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
pentatonic scale we're pretty much using
the<00:00:49.890> boundaries<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> scale<00:00:50.820> we're

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the boundaries of the scale we're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.740 
the boundaries of the scale we're
starting<00:00:51.629> 14<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> G<00:00:52.500> bending<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.070> Oh<00:00:53.750> going

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
starting 14 on the G bending up Oh going

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
starting 14 on the G bending up Oh going
for<00:00:54.809> 12<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.800> B<00:00:55.980> Oh<00:00:56.300> 12<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> e<00:00:58.699> 15<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.879> the

B 12 on the B 14 B 12 on the G Oh

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
B 12 on the B 14 B 12 on the G Oh
sliding<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> back<00:01:10.350> okay

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.910 

Oh<00:01:17.240> lick<00:01:18.240> number<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.440> on<00:01:19.590> its<00:01:19.740> own

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
Oh lick number two we can use on its own

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
Oh lick number two we can use on its own
or<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.520> works<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:21.060> well<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.510> lick

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
or actually works quite well with lick

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
or actually works quite well with lick
number<00:01:22.050> one<00:01:22.230> as<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.310> goes<00:01:23.460> like

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
number one as well this one goes like

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.500 
number one as well this one goes like
this<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:28.940> again<00:01:29.940> we're<00:01:30.120> an<00:01:30.210> E<00:01:30.330> minor

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
this so again we're an E minor

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.390 
this so again we're an E minor
pentatonic<00:01:30.660> using<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> boundaries<00:01:32.070> we're

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
pentatonic using the boundaries we're

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.580 
pentatonic using the boundaries we're
bending<00:01:32.640> fourteen<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.930> G<00:01:34.640> tone<00:01:35.640> there

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
bending fourteen on the G tone there

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.930 
bending fourteen on the G tone there
then<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> B<00:01:38.280> string<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
then we're going for the B string and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.700 
then we're going for the B string and
we're<00:01:39.240> doing<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.510> trill<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.290> case<00:01:40.470> don't

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
we're doing a trill so in case don't

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
we're doing a trill so in case don't
know<00:01:40.770> trill<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> hammer-on<00:01:41.729> followed<00:01:42.390> by

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
know trill is a hammer-on followed by

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.400 
know trill is a hammer-on followed by
pull<00:01:42.840> off<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.500> we're<00:01:43.619> starting<00:01:43.770> 12<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> be

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
pull off so we're starting 12 on the be

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.230 
pull off so we're starting 12 on the be
hammering<00:01:46.410> 15<00:01:47.040> coming<00:01:47.880> back<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> 12<00:01:49.220> and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
hammering 15 coming back off to 12 and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
hammering 15 coming back off to 12 and
then<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> true<00:01:51.570> Ronson<00:01:51.990> spur<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.440> we<00:01:52.619> start

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
then the true Ronson spur if we start

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
then the true Ronson spur if we start
off<00:01:53.040> slow<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.060> builds<00:01:54.479> momentum<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
off slow and then builds momentum and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
off slow and then builds momentum and
finish<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.000> off<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.390> nice<00:02:00.570> Bend<00:02:00.960> 15<00:02:01.560> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
finish that off with a nice Bend 15 on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.570 
finish that off with a nice Bend 15 on
the<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.190> pattern

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.809 

faster<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.390> lick<00:02:13.780> 1<00:02:14.410> &amp;<00:02:14.739> 2<00:02:15.069> together<00:02:15.370> could

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
faster so lick 1 &amp; 2 together could

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.400 
faster so lick 1 &amp; 2 together could
sound<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.150> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 

so<00:02:23.130> lick<00:02:23.370> number<00:02:23.550> three<00:02:23.970> we're<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
so lick number three we're going for the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.690 
so lick number three we're going for the
live<00:02:24.870> version<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.320> hang<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.860> yourself<00:02:26.250> from

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
live version of hang on to yourself from

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.230 
live version of hang on to yourself from
the<00:02:26.790> final<00:02:27.090> Ziggy<00:02:27.300> concert<00:02:27.720> goes<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.740 

oh<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.790> around<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> key<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
oh so this one is around the key of a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.610 
oh so this one is around the key of a
major

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
major

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.020 
major
but<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.920> start<00:02:41.220> off<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.520> relative<00:02:41.850> minor

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
but we start off in the relative minor

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.660 
but we start off in the relative minor
which<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.480> f<00:02:42.660> sharp<00:02:42.690> minor<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.520> one

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
which is f sharp minor so but this one

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
which is f sharp minor so but this one
