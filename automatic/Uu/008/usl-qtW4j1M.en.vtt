a large gathering so you're gonna begin

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.859 
a large gathering so you're gonna begin
by<00:00:18.660> chopping<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:19.740> bacon<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.820> using<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.449> thick

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
by chopping up bacon I'm using a thick

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.160 
by chopping up bacon I'm using a thick
cut<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.590> bacon<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:24.420> using<00:00:24.660> thick

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
cut of bacon here I like using thick

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.429 
cut of bacon here I like using thick
bacon<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.760> stays<00:00:27.180> nice<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
bacon for this because it stays nice and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.780 
bacon for this because it stays nice and
hearty<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.150> bacon<00:00:30.539> needs<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
hearty and this bacon needs to have a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
hearty and this bacon needs to have a
little<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.120> pre<00:00:33.450> cooking<00:00:33.809> process<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
little bit of pre cooking process and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
little bit of pre cooking process and
it's<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.130> ahead<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:35.610> roasted<00:00:35.910> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
it's gonna go ahead and get roasted in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's gonna go ahead and get roasted in
the<00:00:36.360> oven<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> thick<00:00:38.309> bacon

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the oven so I think the thick bacon

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
the oven so I think the thick bacon
holds<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.570> better<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.680> while

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
holds up a little bit better now while

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.400 
holds up a little bit better now while
my<00:00:41.100> bacon<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> browning<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.290> ahead

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
my bacon is browning I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:43.739> chop<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.879> medium<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> large<00:00:47.239> sized

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
like to just chop them in half but

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
like to just chop them in half but
they're<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.299> larger<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> go

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
they're a little bit larger I like to go

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.770 
they're a little bit larger I like to go
ahead<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> quarter<00:01:11.430> them<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.659> want

to<00:01:12.840> overcook<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:13.950> Brussels

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to overcook them I think if Brussels

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
to overcook them I think if Brussels
sprouts<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.760> overcooked<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
sprouts get overcooked they have a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
sprouts get overcooked they have a
sulfuric<00:01:16.799> taste<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> little

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
sulfuric taste and they get a little

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.620 
sulfuric taste and they get a little
bitter<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.430> tender<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bitter so we want these to be tender and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
bitter so we want these to be tender and

finish cooking well it's while the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.930 
finish cooking well it's while the
Brussels<00:02:09.580> spouts

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
Brussels spouts

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.060 
Brussels spouts
are<00:02:10.030> roasting<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.899> if<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.650> Brown<00:02:11.890> it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
are roasting and if you Brown it

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.760 
are roasting and if you Brown it
completely<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> start<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:14.080> gonna<00:02:14.410> be

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
completely to start with it's gonna be

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.720 
completely to start with it's gonna be
overcooked

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
overcooked

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.600 
overcooked
and<00:02:16.020> crisp<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:17.770> been<00:02:18.010> way<00:02:18.190> too<00:02:18.220> crisp

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
and crisp and it's been way too crisp

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.010 
and crisp and it's been way too crisp
and<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.570> very<00:02:19.810> enjoyable

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
and it's not going to be very enjoyable

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.699 
and it's not going to be very enjoyable
so<00:02:20.970> half<00:02:21.970> cook<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.959> don't<00:02:23.140> cook<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
so half cook it if you don't cook it it

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.190 
so half cook it if you don't cook it it
doesn't<00:02:23.920> cook<00:02:24.100> enough<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.880> cook<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.630> part<00:02:26.110> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
doesn't cook enough so cook it part of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.890 
doesn't cook enough so cook it part of
the<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.790> I'm<00:02:27.940> gonna<00:02:28.090> add<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.420> little<00:02:28.660> bit

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the way then I'm gonna add a little bit

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.540 
the way then I'm gonna add a little bit
of<00:02:28.930> salt<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.940> fresh<00:02:31.480> cracked<00:02:31.510> black<00:02:32.410> pepper
