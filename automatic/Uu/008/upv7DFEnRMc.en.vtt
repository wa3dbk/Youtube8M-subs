00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.800 
like component input if you use some of
these<00:05:09.520> special<00:05:09.820> options

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
these special options

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.140 
these special options
it<00:05:11.170> really<00:05:11.380> makes<00:05:11.620> this<00:05:11.830> picture<00:05:12.700> look<00:05:12.880> really

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
it really makes this picture look really

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.120 
it really makes this picture look really
strange<00:05:13.510> like<00:05:13.810> it's<00:05:14.020> streaming<00:05:14.350> busting<00:05:14.980> and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
strange like it's streaming busting and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.110 
strange like it's streaming busting and
badly<00:05:17.040> other<00:05:18.040> than<00:05:18.280> that<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.700> should<00:05:18.730> know

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
badly other than that you should know

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.800 
badly other than that you should know
what<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:20.850> cables<00:05:21.850> are<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.330> order<00:05:22.630> of

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
what the cables are in order of

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:32.190 
what the cables are in order of
greatness<00:05:23.670> they<00:05:24.670> look<00:05:24.850> at<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:31.020> turn<00:05:32.020> some

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
greatness they look at that turn some

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:44.430 
greatness they look at that turn some
lights<00:05:32.230> on<00:05:40.230> so<00:05:41.250> back<00:05:42.250> here<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.870> have<00:05:44.080> your

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
lights on so back here you have your

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:53.130 
lights on so back here you have your
component<00:05:45.040> should<00:05:48.360> be<00:05:49.360> a<00:05:49.720> composite<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:52.140> HDMI

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
component should be a composite and HDMI

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.430 
component should be a composite and HDMI
so<00:05:53.530> your<00:05:53.710> worst<00:05:53.950> is<00:05:54.190> going<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.490> be<00:05:55.230> this<00:05:56.230> one

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
so your worst is going to be this one

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.960 
so your worst is going to be this one
here

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
here

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.160 
here
composite<00:05:58.710> second<00:05:59.710> best<00:05:59.920> is<00:06:00.130> going<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.370> be<00:06:01.170> the

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
composite second best is going to be the

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.640 
composite second best is going to be the
component<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:04.510> best<00:06:04.750> is<00:06:05.080> going<00:06:05.230> to<00:06:05.470> be

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
component and the best is going to be

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.500 
component and the best is going to be
the<00:06:05.860> HDMI<00:06:06.400> cables<00:06:06.850> which<00:06:06.970> just<00:06:07.240> aren't

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
the HDMI cables which just aren't

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.180 
the HDMI cables which just aren't
showing<00:06:07.720> up<00:06:09.390> so<00:06:10.390> there<00:06:11.170> you<00:06:11.290> have<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.830> always
