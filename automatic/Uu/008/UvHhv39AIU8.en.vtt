we're<00:00:23.609> testing<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> scenario<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
we're testing the scenario this is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.359 
we're testing the scenario this is
absolutely<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:25.859> EDC<00:00:26.340> for

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
absolutely all you have your EDC for

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.990 
absolutely all you have your EDC for
that<00:00:26.640> day<00:00:27.710> still<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.980> s30v<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that day still on this s30v so it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
that day still on this s30v so it
shouldn't<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.359> any<00:00:30.539> problem<00:00:31.309> retaining<00:00:32.309> an

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
shouldn't have any problem retaining an

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.530 
shouldn't have any problem retaining an
edge<00:00:32.520> after<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.790> ball<00:00:38.969> bearing<00:00:39.180> lock

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
edge after this this ball bearing lock

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720

is<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.620> compared<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> bench<00:00:41.550> made

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
is also compared to the bench made

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.190 
I think it's holding up really well and
also<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> Spyderco<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> finger

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200

is<00:02:21.050> holding<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.410> edge<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:21.680> well<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.100> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
is holding it edge really well and the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.430 
is holding it edge really well and the
the<00:02:23.030> full<00:02:23.180> fly<00:02:23.360> ground<00:02:23.600> blade<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.080> really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the full fly ground blade is really

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.650 
the full fly ground blade is really
going<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.860> assist<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.030> chopping<00:02:26.540> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
going to assist in the chopping and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.070 
going to assist in the chopping and
slicing<00:02:26.690> out<00:02:27.320> here<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:28.840> said<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.020> this

slicing out here I said you have this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.190 
slicing out here I said you have this
nice<00:02:30.230> finger<00:02:30.590> choil<00:02:31.300> get<00:02:32.300> nice<00:02:32.450> shavings<00:02:32.960> and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
nice finger choil get nice shavings and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.970 
nice finger choil get nice shavings and
it's<00:02:33.890> kind<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.070> collecting<00:02:34.780> beneath<00:02:35.780> us<00:02:38.980> this

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
it's kind of collecting beneath us this

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.100 
it's kind of collecting beneath us this
is<00:02:40.190> going<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:41.000> great<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.630> said<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.960> can

light this you can blow it out and keep
reusing<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.380> will<00:02:45.620> last<00:02:45.800> really<00:02:46.550> really

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
reusing it this will last really really

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.020

long time this full flat grind is really

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.300 
long time this full flat grind is really
biting<00:02:50.240> into<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.600> wood<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.130> see<00:02:52.250> how

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
biting into the wood you can see how

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.470 
biting into the wood you can see how
it's<00:02:52.459> making<00:02:52.700> those<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
it's making those a little like a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.570 
it's making those a little like a
feather<00:02:53.780> stick<00:02:54.110> almost<00:02:54.470> try<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.250> take<00:02:55.459> this

right<00:03:30.530> there<00:03:30.709> which<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:31.040> do<00:03:31.220> because

it's a full steel lined knife so that's

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.920 
it's a full steel lined knife so that's
an<00:03:34.370> advantage<00:03:34.489> you're<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.120> have<00:03:35.300> you

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
an advantage you're going to have you

have a little extra weight you're also
going<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.549> have<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.700> added<00:03:37.970> rigidity

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
going to have that added rigidity

going to have that added rigidity
hatchets<00:03:40.190> are<00:03:40.310> great<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:40.880> having<00:03:41.810> big<00:03:42.110> logs

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.750 
hatchets are great for having big logs
but<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.480> have<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.630> little<00:03:45.530> bitty<00:03:45.769> past<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
but if you have a little bitty past the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.839 
but if you have a little bitty past the
knife<00:03:46.940> still<00:03:47.420> works<00:03:47.660> pretty<00:03:47.989> well<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:54.849> like

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
knife still works pretty well I like

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.589 
knife still works pretty well I like
that<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.269> just<00:03:57.170> hold<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.680> by<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.860> pivot<00:03:58.099> so

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
that you just hold it by the pivot so

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.390 
that you just hold it by the pivot so
pretty<00:03:59.599> much<00:03:59.720> there<00:03:59.900> is<00:03:59.959> no<00:04:00.140> stress<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.860> any

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
pretty much there is no stress and any

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.640 
pretty much there is no stress and any
moving<00:04:01.760> parts<00:04:01.910> in<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.420> knife<00:04:02.630> all<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.349> is

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
moving parts in the knife all it is is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.089 
moving parts in the knife all it is is
just<00:04:03.860> in<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.340> blade<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:06.230> really

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
just in the blade you know but really

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.300 
just in the blade you know but really
most<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.910> us<00:04:08.120> even<00:04:08.510> if<00:04:08.600> we<00:04:08.720> end<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:10.100> this

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
most of us even if we end up like this

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.460 
most of us even if we end up like this
we<00:04:10.760> never<00:04:11.060> really<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.570> this<00:04:11.720> because<00:04:11.900> yeah<00:04:12.200> a

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
we never really do this because yeah a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.570 
we never really do this because yeah a
lot<00:04:12.739> harder<00:04:12.980> it's<00:04:13.850> much<00:04:14.120> more<00:04:14.359> convenient

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
lot harder it's much more convenient

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.940 
lot harder it's much more convenient
it<00:04:17.580> does<00:04:17.730> work
