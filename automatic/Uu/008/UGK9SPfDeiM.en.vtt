00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 today my first review of mods let's 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.720
 start like this and start we start with a weapon 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:26.090
 this 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:30.359
 and there are seven types of weapons 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 which cost one and well which 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.960
 shoot with a range which in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 publicly 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:53.399
 well let's start with m41 let me 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 add new could zombie adds 41 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 only we press damage from him 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 equally next we have a machine 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 Kalashnikov Ak use so here these 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.290
 these two machines are now using 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 I will say this one here it is these charges 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.580
 Kalashnikov machine use this one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.409
 charge 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:27.369
 g17 this one let's test 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:30.219
 by the way until 17 smiled pistols 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 automata and so on so here we have and 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.020
 Makarov here we recharge his account 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.140
 here are the shells 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.049
 see becoming very damage 6 but anyway 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.869
 this one is also used outfits 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.700
 Makarov new he is here now 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.000
 look very very oblique there is 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:02.950
 texture physics is very well drawn 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 we have a creative so everything is now us 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.819
 need to recharge verbal charging 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.549
 with these 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:15.489
 so we kill 2 two shots 2 shot 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:19.349
 so on we go on so let's all 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.540
 the share and then we go 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.920
 melee weapons let's probably start with 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.819
 crazy 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.709
 standard of the best here and so it is 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.390
 very good it is less 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.340
 this is some kind of novelty for us 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.349
 sure what and look like this 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.909
 he has the smallest motor 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.920
 damage you see this is a club with nails 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:54.030
 as far as I understand and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:59.680
 it goes with us ax it goes with us 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.540
 the usual wooden stick is with us 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.209
 By the way, craft is not here for what he 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.250
 have to start the server to give or give 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.160
 they themselves well if you even with friends 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.730
 gat there children all these things what 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.150
 want but the hippo arrange the slaughter there 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.970
 War I do not know very interesting mod a lot 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.410
 ideas so let's start with nipple food y 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.450
 there are a lot of us 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.910
 and here we appear already in 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.160
 we donâ€™t have some banks 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.540
 Crafts flasks also give us flasks of food 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.410
 but this is understandable 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 kampala pepsi and so on so and here it is 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.660
 there is already a craft here this thing is not 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.819
 smoked but these kravets way when 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.670
 the bird is not of this thing which is negro 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.239
 birds need these women they are crafting out 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.830
 seed 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.620
 then you fry these cheeses and pubs and 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.280
 get roasted beans so all now 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.609
 that's all we remove we remove everything 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.510
 removed and then we go some 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.910
 things that really help it already 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.340
 doesn't help here it goes like music and 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.450
 you can even put it somewhere near me 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.450
 something was 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 it doesn't matter let's do 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.850
 new hole here you can put it 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.250
 opens this music goes i have an hour 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.720
 to more like it count with us 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.210
 asphalt as I understood it and it is not known 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.890
 Does not craft at all, but we already have this 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.750
 how would we have such a thing for us 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.160
 given the night vision here let's 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.040
 turn on the night here we have night vision 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.490
 but this thing gives a little scolding 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.790
 there is here very interesting very anime 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.640
