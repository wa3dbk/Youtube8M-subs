next update I would hope so because so
far<00:00:12.309> I'm<00:00:12.459> having<00:00:12.789> fun<00:00:13.000> with<00:00:13.180> it<00:00:13.330> and<00:00:13.449> it<00:00:13.510> seems

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
far I'm having fun with it and it seems

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.189 
far I'm having fun with it and it seems
pretty<00:00:13.959> awesome<00:00:14.500> so<00:00:15.250> yeah<00:00:15.869> there's<00:00:16.869> server

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
pretty awesome so yeah there's server

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.830 
pretty awesome so yeah there's server
textures<00:00:17.680> a<00:00:17.920> new<00:00:18.190> option<00:00:18.820> as<00:00:19.360> well<00:00:19.420> as<00:00:19.690> the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
textures a new option as well as the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.720 
textures a new option as well as the
whole<00:00:20.020> layout<00:00:20.230> of<00:00:20.620> the<00:00:20.830> options<00:00:21.190> is<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.460> little

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
whole layout of the options is a little

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.520 
whole layout of the options is a little
different<00:00:22.030> so<00:00:22.510> we<00:00:22.600> have<00:00:22.720> server<00:00:22.930> textures<00:00:23.380> on

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
different so we have server textures on

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.320 
different so we have server textures on
which<00:00:23.770> I'm<00:00:23.980> assuming<00:00:24.130> that<00:00:24.700> means<00:00:24.850> like<00:00:25.150> if

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
which I'm assuming that means like if

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.460 
which I'm assuming that means like if
you<00:00:25.450> go<00:00:25.539> into<00:00:25.660> servers<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.289> they<00:00:26.350> have<00:00:26.440> a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
you go into servers and they have a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.260 
you go into servers and they have a
texture<00:00:26.890> pack<00:00:27.100> loaded<00:00:27.580> on<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.090> server

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
texture pack loaded on to the server

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.230 
texture pack loaded on to the server
you'll<00:00:29.080> actually<00:00:29.320> see<00:00:29.770> it<00:00:29.860> if<00:00:30.160> as<00:00:30.789> so<00:00:31.030> that's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
you'll actually see it if as so that's

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.939 
you'll actually see it if as so that's
pretty<00:00:31.420> awesome<00:00:31.510> it<00:00:31.900> has<00:00:32.020> chat<00:00:32.320> settings<00:00:32.559> now

and you can see it you can do / kill
kills<00:01:26.770> yourself<00:01:27.509> villagers<00:01:28.509> have<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.840> little

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
kills yourself villagers have a little

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.359 
kills yourself villagers have a little
bit<00:01:29.170> different<00:01:29.499> colors<00:01:29.770> I'll<00:01:29.979> get<00:01:30.130> into<00:01:30.279> that

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
bit different colors I'll get into that

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.359 
bit different colors I'll get into that
in<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.729> minute<00:01:31.200> normally<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.469> only<00:01:32.889> had<00:01:33.159> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
in a minute normally it only had the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.399 
in a minute normally it only had the
half<00:01:33.849> slabs<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.450> planks<00:01:34.779> that<00:01:34.840> look<00:01:35.049> like<00:01:35.170> that

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
half slabs of planks that look like that

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.379 
half slabs of planks that look like that
now<00:01:35.619> they<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.889> all<00:01:36.130> colors<00:01:36.639> of<00:01:36.880> half<00:01:37.060> slabs

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
now they have all colors of half slabs

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.899 
now they have all colors of half slabs
so<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.139> will<00:01:38.289> be<00:01:38.920> good<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.130> decorative

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
so that will be good for decorative

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.629 
so that will be good for decorative
purposes<00:01:40.740> okay<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.979> then<00:01:42.189> they<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.459> new

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
purposes okay and then they have a new

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.059 
purposes okay and then they have a new
feature<00:01:42.880> called<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.719> large<00:01:43.929> biome<00:01:44.409> spawn<00:01:44.770> you

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
feature called the large biome spawn you

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.889 
feature called the large biome spawn you
go<00:01:45.189> into<00:01:45.369> more<00:01:45.549> options<00:01:46.029> with<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.450> world<00:01:46.630> and

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
go into more options with the world and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.699 
go into more options with the world and
you<00:01:47.889> go<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.399> large<00:01:48.849> biomes<00:01:49.329> and<00:01:49.659> here's<00:01:50.590> what

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
you go to large biomes and here's what

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.909 
you go to large biomes and here's what
it<00:01:50.770> looks<00:01:50.950> like<00:01:51.039> on<00:01:51.249> the<00:01:51.310> map<00:01:51.549> as<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.619> can<00:01:53.740> see

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:53.919 
it looks like on the map as you can see

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:56.429 
it looks like on the map as you can see
that<00:01:53.950> whole<00:01:54.549> green<00:01:55.119> part<00:01:55.599> is<00:01:55.810> just<00:01:55.840> one<00:01:56.409> giant

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
that whole green part is just one giant

the weather generate structures of
course<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.260> still<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.620> same<00:06:29.650> world<00:06:30.430> type<00:06:30.700> you

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
course is still the same world type you

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.029 
course is still the same world type you
can<00:06:31.060> do<00:06:31.180> flat<00:06:31.539> and<00:06:31.870> now<00:06:32.380> there's<00:06:32.620> a<00:06:32.680> new<00:06:32.830> option

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
can do flat and now there's a new option

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.140 
can do flat and now there's a new option
called<00:06:33.460> large<00:06:33.760> biomes<00:06:34.240> what<00:06:34.870> it<00:06:34.960> does

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
called large biomes what it does

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.970 
called large biomes what it does
this<00:06:35.240> makes<00:06:35.480> a<00:06:35.690> biome<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.290> is<00:06:36.410> absolutely

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
this makes a biome that is absolutely

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.460 
this makes a biome that is absolutely
massive<00:06:37.280> all<00:06:37.640> the<00:06:37.760> biomes<00:06:38.120> are<00:06:38.360> just<00:06:38.660> expanded

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
massive all the biomes are just expanded

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.360 
massive all the biomes are just expanded
basically<00:06:40.190> so<00:06:40.730> if<00:06:41.060> you<00:06:41.420> want<00:06:41.570> to<00:06:41.630> grass<00:06:41.810> biome

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
basically so if you want to grass biome

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.000 
basically so if you want to grass biome
you<00:06:43.370> spawn<00:06:43.880> in<00:06:44.090> you<00:06:44.450> find<00:06:44.780> one<00:06:44.990> and<00:06:45.200> it<00:06:45.710> will<00:06:45.860> be

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
you spawn in you find one and it will be

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.010 
you spawn in you find one and it will be
just<00:06:46.520> completely<00:06:46.790> massive<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.720> you'll

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
as you guys can see i spawned into a

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.680 
as you guys can see i spawned into a
snow<00:07:02.690> biome<00:07:02.900> here's<00:07:03.560> my<00:07:03.770> chest<00:07:04.550> usually<00:07:05.510> comes

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
snow biome here's my chest usually comes

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.420 
snow biome here's my chest usually comes

I think it comes with the same thing
every<00:07:07.640> time<00:07:07.670> wooden<00:07:08.360> axe<00:07:08.540> I<00:07:08.810> mean<00:07:09.380> pickaxe

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
every time wooden axe I mean pickaxe

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.810 
every time wooden axe I mean pickaxe
stone<00:07:10.760> axe<00:07:11.290> four<00:07:12.290> sticks<00:07:12.560> some<00:07:13.370> wood<00:07:13.580> and
