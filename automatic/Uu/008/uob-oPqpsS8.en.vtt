this<00:02:01.580> is<00:02:01.910> what<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.540> you<00:02:02.660> get<00:02:02.780> drop<00:02:03.110> out<00:02:03.320> of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
this is what if you get drop out of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.179 
this is what if you get drop out of
bombs<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:04.190> Japan

and wonderful your this this world you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.979 
and wonderful your this this world you
construct<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.879> is<00:02:55.000> it's<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.330> really<00:02:55.629> boring

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
construct it is it's just really boring

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.750 
construct it is it's just really boring
that<00:02:56.349> they<00:02:56.470> can<00:02:56.590> ask<00:02:56.800> me<00:02:57.010> about<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.310> character

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that they can ask me about the character

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.000 
that they can ask me about the character
and<00:02:57.849> that's<00:02:58.000> that's<00:02:58.510> my<00:02:58.690> goal<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.080> 20<00:02:59.620> color<00:02:59.860> I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and that's that's my goal in 20 color I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.380 
and that's that's my goal in 20 color I
think<00:03:00.129> if<00:03:00.190> it's<00:03:00.310> going<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.550> succeed<00:03:00.879> it'll

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
think if it's going to succeed it'll

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.350 
think if it's going to succeed it'll
succeed<00:03:01.540> for<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.260> reason<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:03.180> first<00:03:04.180> thing

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
succeed for that reason the first thing

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.690 
succeed for that reason the first thing
you<00:03:04.420> said<00:03:04.629> about<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:05.040> what<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:09.250> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
you said about it what if right but you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.360 
you said about it what if right but you
don't<00:03:09.879> like

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
don't like

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.550 
don't like
yeah<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:11.030> think<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.659> funny<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.080> say

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
yeah I think it's funny that you say

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.589 
yeah I think it's funny that you say
that<00:03:12.590> because<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.670> never<00:03:13.879> hear<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.450> in

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
that because that you never hear that in

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.089 
that because that you never hear that in
the<00:03:14.690> first<00:03:14.930> issue<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.440> don't<00:03:15.620> know<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:15.920> we'll

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
the first issue I don't know if we'll

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.720 
the first issue I don't know if we'll
ever

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
ever

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.240 
ever
right<00:03:17.360> that's<00:03:18.170> part<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.530> setting<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.980> world

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
right that's part of setting the world

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.530 
right that's part of setting the world
but<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:19.909> not<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.300> story's<00:03:20.599> about

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
but it's not what the story's about

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.600 
but it's not what the story's about
takes<00:03:21.989> place<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.580 

absolutely

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
bad for Israel because the Soviet Union

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.589 
bad for Israel because the Soviet Union
is<00:03:38.980> more<00:03:39.370> powerful<00:03:39.580> because<00:03:40.150> they<00:03:40.330> were<00:03:40.390> able

that<00:03:45.400> means<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:46.049> this<00:03:47.049> circle<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.440> able<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
that means is this circle is able to

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.990 
that means is this circle is able to
they<00:03:50.019> have<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.620> launch<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:51.190> nuclear<00:03:51.910> strike

against Iran and the mask is because the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.250 
against Iran and the mask is because the
Iranian<00:03:54.370> align<00:03:54.700> themselves<00:03:54.910> with<00:03:55.269> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
Iranian align themselves with the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.619 
Iranian align themselves with the
Soviets<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.160> United<00:03:57.549> States<00:03:57.970> responds

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
Soviets and the United States responds

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.390 
Soviets and the United States responds
by<00:03:58.810> Newton's<00:03:59.290> Soviet<00:03:59.650> Union<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.190> turns

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
by Newton's Soviet Union and it turns

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.300 
by Newton's Soviet Union and it turns
into<00:04:00.519> a<00:04:00.640> Holocaust<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.590> win<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:02.890> bumps<00:04:03.160> in

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310

buildings<00:04:12.099> poking<00:04:12.489> up<00:04:12.640> out<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.970> water

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
buildings poking up out of the water

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150 
buildings poking up out of the water
like<00:04:13.390> giant<00:04:13.720> cypresses<00:04:14.290> all<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.920> them<00:04:15.010> look

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
like giant cypresses all of them look

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.590 
like giant cypresses all of them look
like<00:04:15.340> they<00:04:15.489> couldn't<00:04:15.670> tell<00:04:15.910> them<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.269> minute

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
like they couldn't tell them in a minute

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.759 
like they couldn't tell them in a minute
right<00:04:18.090> right<00:04:19.090> yeah<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> idea<00:04:20.709> is

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
right right yeah and and the idea is

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.670 
right right yeah and and the idea is
that<00:04:20.829> different<00:04:21.340> gangs<00:04:22.240> each<00:04:22.750> building<00:04:23.410> each

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
that different gangs each building each

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.800 
that different gangs each building each
tower<00:04:23.979> is<00:04:24.580> inhabited<00:04:25.150> by<00:04:25.150> different<00:04:25.630> gang

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
tower is inhabited by different gang

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.210 
tower is inhabited by different gang
it's<00:04:26.020> kind<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.200> like<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.410> Warriors<00:04:26.770> each<00:04:26.919> gang

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
it's kind of like the Warriors each gang

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.409 
it's kind of like the Warriors each gang
has<00:04:27.850> its<00:04:28.210> own<00:04:28.919> has<00:04:29.919> its<00:04:30.100> own<00:04:30.220> logo<00:04:30.699> so<00:04:31.150> named

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
has its own has its own logo so named

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.750 
has its own has its own logo so named
its<00:04:31.630> own<00:04:31.750> cultures<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.530> way<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.680> dressing<00:04:32.979> and

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
its own cultures and way of dressing and

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.550 
its own cultures and way of dressing and
they'll<00:04:33.910> engage<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.450> kind<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.720> warfare<00:04:34.960> and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
they'll engage in kind of warfare and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.990 
they'll engage in kind of warfare and
the<00:04:35.620> ropes<00:04:35.950> are<00:04:36.160> dying<00:04:36.400> off<00:04:36.639> too<00:04:36.820> because

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
the ropes are dying off too because

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.400 
the ropes are dying off too because
obviously<00:04:37.150> things<00:04:37.510> are<00:04:37.630> radiated<00:04:38.139> so<00:04:38.289> it's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
obviously things are radiated so it's

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.830 
obviously things are radiated so it's
sort<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.740> slowly<00:04:39.250> poison<00:04:39.789> is<00:04:39.910> leeching<00:04:40.389> up

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
