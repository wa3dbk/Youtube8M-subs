is<00:04:03.140> going<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.380> be<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.770> put<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.340> project<00:04:04.780> into

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
is going to be to put a project into

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.960 
is going to be to put a project into
source<00:04:06.020> control

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
source control

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.670 
source control
so<00:04:07.970> I've<00:04:08.330> loaded<00:04:08.540> up<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.960> sample<00:04:09.530> application

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so I've loaded up a sample application

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.890 
so I've loaded up a sample application
and<00:04:10.310> what<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.880> need<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.240> do<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.480> create<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.810> new
