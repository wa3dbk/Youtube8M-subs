going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.040> take<00:01:59.500> concept<00:02:00.500> artist<00:02:00.799> tries<00:02:01.310> to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
going to take concept artist tries to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.330 
going to take concept artist tries to
communicate<00:02:01.939> through<00:02:02.659> composition<00:02:03.560> what<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
communicate through composition what the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.030 
communicate through composition what the
idea<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.670> trying<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.180> across

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
idea is trying to get across

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.340 
idea is trying to get across
a<00:02:07.160> lot<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:07.820> times<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.180> direction<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.140> gets

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
a lot of times the direction just gets

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.200 
a lot of times the direction just gets
narrow<00:02:09.710> down<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.610> just<00:02:10.790> make<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:10.940> look

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
narrow down to can you just make it look

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.320

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.950 
interesting thing with some of the ideas
that<00:05:26.199> we<00:05:26.470> came<00:05:26.620> up<00:05:26.680> with<00:05:26.979> is<00:05:27.479> not<00:05:28.479> only<00:05:28.750> do<00:05:28.870> we

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
that we came up with is not only do we

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.240 
that we came up with is not only do we
need<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.199> figure<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.440> how<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.680> Brutes

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
need to figure out how the Brutes

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.399 
need to figure out how the Brutes
interact<00:05:30.880> with<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.150> other<00:05:31.240> covenant<00:05:31.810> but

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
interact with the other covenant but

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.379 
interact with the other covenant but
also<00:05:32.560> how<00:05:32.770> brutes<00:05:33.039> interact<00:05:33.490> with<00:05:33.699> fruits<00:05:34.090> and

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
also how brutes interact with fruits and

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.300 
also how brutes interact with fruits and
we<00:05:35.139> developed<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.590> idea<00:05:35.650> of<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.039> brute<00:05:36.310> pack

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
we developed the idea of the brute pack

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.469 
we developed the idea of the brute pack
what<00:05:39.310> makes<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.550> feel<00:05:39.729> like<00:05:39.759> two<00:05:40.060> characters

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
what makes it feel like two characters

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.089 
what makes it feel like two characters
are<00:05:40.599> aware<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.840> each<00:05:40.990> other<00:05:41.199> deciding<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.979> do

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
are aware of each other deciding to do

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.760 
are aware of each other deciding to do
the<00:05:42.250> same<00:05:42.490> thing<00:05:42.759> at<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:42.909> same<00:05:43.000> time<00:05:43.770> maybe

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
the same thing at the same time maybe

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.200 
the same thing at the same time maybe
you're<00:05:44.979> kind<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.280> come<00:05:45.400> around<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.729> corner<00:05:45.759> and

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
you're kind of come around a corner and

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.730 
you're kind of come around a corner and
see<00:05:46.419> them<00:05:46.599> doing<00:05:46.900> some<00:05:47.139> sort<00:05:47.349> of<00:05:47.380> an<00:05:47.469> activity

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
see them doing some sort of an activity

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.740 
see them doing some sort of an activity
that<00:05:47.949> that<00:05:48.849> has<00:05:49.090> nothing<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.479> do<00:05:49.599> with

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
that that has nothing to do with

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.909 
that that has nothing to do with
fighting<00:05:49.960> but<00:05:50.199> it's<00:05:50.349> going<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.500> give<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:50.740> sort

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
fighting but it's going to give you sort

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.480 
fighting but it's going to give you sort
of<00:05:51.039> more<00:05:51.219> insight<00:05:51.669> into<00:05:51.909> what<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.570> brute

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
of more insight into what the brute

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.990 
of more insight into what the brute
holiday<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.030> like<00:05:55.220> we<00:05:56.220> have<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.550> really

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.860 

where<00:06:17.069> players<00:06:17.580> kill<00:06:17.940> them<00:06:18.090> they're<00:06:18.509> like<00:06:18.539> oh

man I had to kill that guy and then they
go<00:06:20.669> around<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:21.030> corner<00:06:21.060> and<00:06:21.419> there's<00:06:21.750> like<00:06:21.930> four

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
go around a corner and there's like four

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.559 
go around a corner and there's like four
more<00:06:23.039> understanding<00:06:23.729> there<00:06:23.880> right<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.419> their

more understanding there right in their
life<00:06:25.130> I<00:06:29.090> think<00:06:30.090> that<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.840> Brutes<00:06:31.080> bring<00:06:31.889> out

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
life I think that the Brutes bring out

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.180 
life I think that the Brutes bring out
sort<00:06:32.759> of<00:06:32.849> the<00:06:33.319> pigment<00:06:34.319> self-righteous

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
sort of the pigment self-righteous

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.149 
sort of the pigment self-righteous
aspect<00:06:36.090> of<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.419> lot<00:06:36.539> of<00:06:36.659> players<00:06:36.840> so<00:06:37.560> I'm<00:06:37.830> hoping

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
aspect of a lot of players so I'm hoping

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.420 
aspect of a lot of players so I'm hoping
