00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
looks like somewhat of an

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.940 
looks like somewhat of an
african-american<00:00:30.789> guy<00:00:31.419> just<00:00:32.200> chilling<00:00:32.800> there

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.320 
african-american guy just chilling there
I<00:00:32.980> thought<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:33.520> don't<00:00:33.700> know<00:00:33.760> exactly<00:00:34.090> what<00:00:34.240> he's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
I thought I don't know exactly what he's

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.880 
I thought I don't know exactly what he's
doing<00:00:34.360> but<00:00:34.960> he's<00:00:35.020> holding<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.410> gun<00:00:35.560> and<00:00:35.830> it

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.230 
doing but he's holding the gun and it
looks<00:00:36.040> like<00:00:36.100> he's<00:00:36.310> shooting<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:36.790> also<00:00:37.000> put

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
looks like he's shooting and I also put

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.970 
looks like he's shooting and I also put
up<00:00:37.330> a<00:00:37.390> picture<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:37.900> you<00:00:37.930> can<00:00:38.020> look<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.560> see

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
up a picture so you can look and see

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.550 
up a picture so you can look and see
what<00:00:39.100> they<00:00:39.280> they<00:00:39.700> look<00:00:39.880> close<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.560> identical

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
what they they look close to identical

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.500 
what they they look close to identical
obviously<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:42.550> hasn't<00:00:42.730> been<00:00:43.000> any<00:00:43.210> news

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
obviously it really hasn't been any news

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.270 
obviously it really hasn't been any news
on<00:00:43.780> zombie<00:00:44.260> guns<00:00:44.410> even<00:00:44.710> from<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.040> trailer

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
on zombie guns even from the trailer

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.860 
on zombie guns even from the trailer
because<00:00:45.430> nobody<00:00:45.790> can<00:00:45.910> really<00:00:46.060> figure<00:00:46.720> out

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870
