 they are very good 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.830
 the efficient driving that we have to take into account to be able to do 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.270
 the agreement also against the government we are going to need that environment 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 labor and that of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.040
 but very little nothing more 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.460
 i know they also kill 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.400
 from the marm decades 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 good first thing we're going to do 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 tread well 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 the butter 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.970
 and what is left 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.210
 in this way 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.690
 so it's called dot com ar 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.900
 Simon has to be clean 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.060
 but it has to look good 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 as well as if it was a puree 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 we have added 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 to maintain once you're well-trodden 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.960
 you can see there 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 behave well well maybe the butter 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.549
 the difficult medium 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.959
 with a hand 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 do this and on the other hand have the camera filming 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.069
 where you can see how they have to go 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.269
 the consistency of butter 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.269
 kebede cutting little images 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.279

 there I have good 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.249
 maybe the butter 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.589
 one thousand two hundred grams 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.589
 of shortening is enough 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.109
 we are looking at this way and what we are going to do now is to add 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.419
 to this mixture 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.799
 webó what we are going to do games we are going to oppose a little essence of 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.729
 vanilla 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.229
 already directly 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.500
 a good jet 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.659
 to her 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.520
 we should not be afraid of insecurity 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.649
 you have to put with confidence 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.299
 and we're going to take it 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.299
 alarming 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.939
 then two games 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.759
 for the original comic takes 200 grams of butter 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.679
 two games 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.269
 this one cup of black sugar a white sugar rate 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.389
 and the steps and stockings of Ávila 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.389
 if I could maybe step on a little bit more 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 because voters biscuits 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.519
 the original is that 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.429
 is a recipe for the most famous cookies in the United States 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.539
 that we are not done that boy wanted

 that after living with 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.029
 American for so many years 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.029
 I learned to be one of my favorites 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.599
 one of the richest of all 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.930
 what are we going to do now an irregular we have everything well mixed the 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.969
 butter 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.299
 with the game oncologist the previously shakes and 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.299
 they will not break their own directly on the table 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.479
 we have everything well mixed 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.490
 for what we're going to do we're going to win 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.400
 sugar rates 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.509
 I do not have the black sugar 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.180
 I say add 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 a whole house 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.029
 they are actually three-quarters of a square 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.189
 but the US measures and ours are a bit difficult because 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.729
 different I say because 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.309
 the rates of them 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.569
 the whole afternoons of it are the half master rates 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.710
 esic in another amount of always are a little bigger 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.830
 but there is no problem 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.150
 we have done the process 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.249
 an interannual rate 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.889
 of black sugar 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.259
 let's read him 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.259

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.289
 sugar 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.270
 if they increase in vita 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.270
 of his capture 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.129
 once we have the whole country 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.990
 Let's go with the wooden spoon 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.550
 let's start 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.550
 when mixing everything 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.499
