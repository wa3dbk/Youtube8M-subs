this<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> generator<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:16.500> consists<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this is a generator and it consists of a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
this is a generator and it consists of a
rotor<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.180> has<00:00:18.420> wires<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.260> connected<00:00:19.949> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
rotor that has wires on it connected to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.650 
rotor that has wires on it connected to
metal<00:00:20.550> bands<00:00:20.820> which<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.300> called<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
metal bands which are called the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.970 
metal bands which are called the
commutator<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:25.230> order<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> make

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
commutator and in order to make

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
commutator and in order to make
electricity<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.150> must<00:00:27.420> move<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.810> wire<00:00:28.080> next<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
electricity one must move a wire next to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
electricity one must move a wire next to
a<00:00:28.830> magnet<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.080> here<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> magnets<00:00:32.989> put

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
a magnet and here are the magnets put

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.150 
a magnet and here are the magnets put
those<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.530> there

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
those on there

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
those on there
and<00:00:35.870> turn<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> crank<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.969> now<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> light

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and turn the crank and now the light

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
and turn the crank and now the light
goes<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> notice<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.129> green

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
goes on and you notice that the green

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.510 
goes on and you notice that the green
light<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> red<00:00:42.420> light<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.140> on

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
light is on with the red light is not on

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
light is on with the red light is not on
return<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> other<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
return the other way I have it this is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
return the other way I have it this is
connected<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> DC<00:00:47.190> generator<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
connected as a DC generator now on it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
connected as a DC generator now on it
depending<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> rotate<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.219> get

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
depending on which way I rotate I get

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
depending on which way I rotate I get
plus<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:50.879> minus<00:00:52.670> if<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.210> AC<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:55.579> move<00:00:56.579> over

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
plus or minus if I want AC I move over

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
plus or minus if I want AC I move over
the<00:00:57.180> context<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.039> call<00:00:59.280> slip

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the context so that we have we call slip

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.020 
the context so that we have we call slip
rings<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.740> notice<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.729> stability

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
rings now you notice that for stability

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.410 
rings now you notice that for stability
light<00:01:10.460> simultaneously<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.060> AC<00:01:14.420> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
light simultaneously because it's AC so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
light simultaneously because it's AC so
one<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.869> add<00:01:15.990> both<00:01:16.200> AC<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.799> DC<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.310> take<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
one can add both AC or DC to take and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
one can add both AC or DC to take and
how<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.479> connection<00:01:19.170> sort<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> why<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
how one looks connection sort of why is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.030 
how one looks connection sort of why is
that<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.549> voltages<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> matter<00:01:22.040> where

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that these voltages to the matter where

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
that these voltages to the matter where
it<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> magnet<00:01:24.150> away<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.750> rotate

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it could take the magnet away and rotate

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.069 
it could take the magnet away and rotate
all<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.229> water<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.860> happens<00:01:29.720> we've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
all your water what happens we've got to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.090 
all your water what happens we've got to
have<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> magnet<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.030> wire<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.200> that's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
have a magnet and the wire and that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
have a magnet and the wire and that's
how<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.670> electricity<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.140> do

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
how you make electricity and you can do

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
how you make electricity and you can do
it<00:01:37.439> by<00:01:37.590> any<00:01:37.829> means<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.460> allows<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> turn

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it by any means it allows you to turn

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.149 
it by any means it allows you to turn
that<00:01:39.659> shaft<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> windmill<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that shaft you can have a windmill you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
that shaft you can have a windmill you
can<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> water<00:01:42.000> wheel<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
can have a water wheel you can have a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
can have a water wheel you can have a
turbine<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.280> has<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.700> steam<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.210> blows

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
turbine which has got steam that blows

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.310 
turbine which has got steam that blows
against<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.100> bunch<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> vanes<00:01:47.990> that's<00:01:48.990> all

against a bunch of vanes that's all
there<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.860> electricity<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> move<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there is about electricity you move a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
there is about electricity you move a
wire<00:01:51.270> next<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> magnet<00:01:53.479> except<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
wire next to a magnet except you have to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
wire next to a magnet except you have to
make<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.259> big<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.829> make<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> useful<00:01:56.430> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
make them big to make it useful for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060 
make them big to make it useful for
anybody
