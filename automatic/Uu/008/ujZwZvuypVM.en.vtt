and if you can tell me why arms can play
anyway<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:52.390> reason<00:01:52.719> why<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:53.200> because<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
anyway the reason why is because we

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.480 
anyway the reason why is because we
already<00:01:56.289> got<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.500> crate<00:01:56.829> since<00:01:57.070> no<00:01:57.310> go

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
already got the crate since no go

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.399 
already got the crate since no go
because<00:01:57.640> we're<00:01:57.789> in<00:01:57.939> snow<00:01:58.210> go<00:01:58.270> now<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.289> had

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
because we're in snow go now if you had

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.660 
because we're in snow go now if you had
to<00:01:59.470> get<00:01:59.590> crates<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.189> moon<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.549> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
to get crates and here the moon of the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.130

end of the gym of the first place in the
other<00:02:02.229> look<00:02:02.470> first<00:02:03.340> time<00:02:03.549> now<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:06.250> going<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
other look first time now we're going to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.169 
other look first time now we're going to
be<00:02:06.789> ready

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
be ready

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.390 
be ready
I'm<00:02:07.569> still<00:02:07.929> gonna<00:02:08.110> try<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.679> go<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:08.950> my<00:02:09.039> record

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I'm still gonna try and go for my record

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.250 
I'm still gonna try and go for my record
this<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.550> why<00:02:12.700> there<00:02:12.880> are<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.150> many<00:02:13.239> nitros<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
this is why there are so many nitros to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.370 
this is why there are so many nitros to
collect<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.950> level<00:02:15.160> because<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.959> keeps

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
collect in that level because this keeps

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.670 
collect in that level because this keeps
up<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.890> when<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.459> use<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> box<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.120> destroy

red<00:02:24.160> gem<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.060> that's<00:02:25.690> how<00:02:25.870> we<00:02:25.959> do<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
red gem see that that's how we do it

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.600 
red gem see that that's how we do it
because<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.220> absolutely

professionally<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.230> now<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.769> go<00:02:29.890> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
professionally so now we can just go to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.710 
professionally so now we can just go to
the<00:02:30.040> end<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.220> level<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:30.610> pretty<00:02:30.880> easy<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.599> I
