on one of these this will show a hundred
percent<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.510> everything<00:04:24.900> because<00:04:25.080> I've<00:04:25.199> saved

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
percent on everything because I've saved

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.779 
percent on everything because I've saved
it<00:04:25.669> but<00:04:26.669> for<00:04:26.910> something<00:04:27.090> else<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:29.430> know<00:04:29.550> maybe

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
it but for something else you know maybe

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.370 
it but for something else you know maybe
that's<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.150> little<00:04:30.180> bit<00:04:30.449> more<00:04:30.600> spotty<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.289> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
that's a little bit more spotty so you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.100 
that's a little bit more spotty so you
could<00:04:31.620> tap<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.100> book<00:04:32.580> or<00:04:33.270> tap<00:04:33.449> down<00:04:33.660> one<00:04:33.840> all

could tap on a book or tap down one all

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.689 
could tap on a book or tap down one all
and<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:35.160> will<00:04:35.430> download<00:04:35.820> in<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.600> background

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
and it will download in the background

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.770 
and it will download in the background
so<00:04:38.699> you<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.910> see<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.389> working<00:04:39.720> on
