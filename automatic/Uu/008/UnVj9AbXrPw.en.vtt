00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
things to help with that you also will

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:13.739 
things to help with that you also will
need<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.609> build<00:01:12.759> saloons<00:01:13.210> which<00:01:13.450> will<00:01:13.600> build

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
need to build saloons which will build

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.899 
need to build saloons which will build
up<00:01:13.840> certain<00:01:14.049> houses<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.399> make<00:01:15.520> them<00:01:15.700> bigger

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
up certain houses to make them bigger

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.660 
up certain houses to make them bigger
and<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.899> all<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.079> this<00:01:17.289> things<00:01:18.249> need<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.429> work

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and so all of this things need to work

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.520 
and so all of this things need to work
together<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.240> order<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.570> build<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:20.020> city<00:01:20.380> of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
together in order to build a city of

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.770 
together in order to build a city of
that<00:01:20.619> function<00:01:21.060> trade<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.210> big<00:01:22.359> part<00:01:22.539> of<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
that function trade is a big part of the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.719 
that function trade is a big part of the
game<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.499> can<00:01:23.679> buy<00:01:23.859> goods<00:01:24.189> from<00:01:24.340> other<00:01:24.520> cities

game you can buy goods from other cities

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.940 
game you can buy goods from other cities
or<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.359> can<00:01:25.509> sell<00:01:25.719> goods<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.049> your<00:01:26.170> own<00:01:26.319> you'll

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
or you can sell goods of your own you'll

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.590 
or you can sell goods of your own you'll
often<00:01:27.100> notice<00:01:27.579> that<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.030> are<00:01:28.060> missing

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
often notice that you are missing

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.080 
often notice that you are missing
certain<00:01:28.929> key<00:01:29.170> goods<00:01:29.469> in<00:01:29.770> any<00:01:30.069> different<00:01:30.490> city

certain key goods in any different city

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.429 
certain key goods in any different city
set<00:01:31.329> up<00:01:31.479> so<00:01:31.600> you're<00:01:31.719> going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.929> know<00:01:32.200> that

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
set up so you're going to know that

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.809 
set up so you're going to know that
you'll<00:01:32.530> probably<00:01:32.979> need<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.189> purchase<00:01:33.429> those

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
you'll probably need to purchase those

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.730 
you'll probably need to purchase those
I'm<00:01:34.030> going<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.210> give<00:01:34.329> it<00:01:34.359> a<00:01:34.420> basis<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.619> then

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
I'm going to give it a basis but then

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.599 
I'm going to give it a basis but then
again<00:01:35.859> you<00:01:35.950> want<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.189> figure<00:01:36.280> out<00:01:36.399> what<00:01:36.520> you

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
again you want to figure out what you

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.190 
again you want to figure out what you
can<00:01:36.700> sell<00:01:36.969> for<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.210> high<00:01:37.240> price<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.600> focus<00:01:38.079> on

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
can sell for a high price and focus on

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.539 
can sell for a high price and focus on
gathering<00:01:38.469> that<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.069> you<00:01:39.189> can<00:01:39.310> really

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
gathering that so that you can really

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.910 
gathering that so that you can really
get<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.819> economy<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.780> know<00:01:41.679> this<00:01:41.770> has

are<00:02:14.739> pretty<00:02:14.950> low<00:02:15.220> eventually<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.849> can<00:02:15.909> get<00:02:16.060> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
are pretty low eventually you can get to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
expecting but it definitely fits well on

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.230 
expecting but it definitely fits well on
mobile<00:02:35.830> since<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.280> very<00:02:36.370> controlled<00:02:37.000> and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
mobile since it's very controlled and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.640 
mobile since it's very controlled and
you<00:02:37.300> kind<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.630> clear<00:02:37.930> goals<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.470> can

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you kind of have clear goals you can

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.110 
you kind of have clear goals you can
play<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.250> bus<00:02:39.460> ride<00:02:39.730> or<00:02:40.090> something

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
play this a in a bus ride or something

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.360 
play this a in a bus ride or something
like<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.510> rather<00:02:41.230> than<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:42.070> kind<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.280> an

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
like that rather than just kind of an

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.280 
like that rather than just kind of an
ongoing<00:02:42.520> situation<00:02:43.060> well<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:43.930> games

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
ongoing situation well I do like games

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.170 
ongoing situation well I do like games
like<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.950> definitely<00:02:45.340> filling<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
like that this is definitely filling a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.630 
like that this is definitely filling a
different<00:02:46.540> niche<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.130> summary<00:02:48.340> your

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
different niche so in summary your

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.060 
different niche so in summary your
mileage<00:02:48.910> will<00:02:49.030> vary<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:50.050> very<00:02:50.320> capable<00:02:50.830> game

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
mileage will vary it's very capable game

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.959 
mileage will vary it's very capable game
but<00:02:51.640> definitely<00:02:52.090> not<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.540> every<00:02:52.780> person
