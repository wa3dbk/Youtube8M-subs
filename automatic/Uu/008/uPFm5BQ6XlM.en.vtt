00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 besides having come around to one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 new league of legends can compare 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.160
 between this from an iron castle 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 originating Werburg and a whole 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 Ordinary was as full as you are here 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.450
 Comparison between the new wolfskin 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.760
 with the name roger waite matching quasi 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 as a counterpart of jim rogers we already 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 have shown before and now here 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 So go back to the classic way 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 right while they are dancing here nicely 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 animation through and go there I have 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 a bit on the optics because 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 Control 1 simply stops 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 and how in front of him 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.170
 does not do anything special in any case 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.760
 very narrow that this mask right 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 colossal osieck we do not really see 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 more the face but as well 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.770
 gloves or the arm band or 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 everything you have equipped with pip 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.100
 and this is pretty much guilty of holzer 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.640
 quite a bit of what you garden 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 Predator longer if you ask me 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 Overall, I find you this child 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 pretty awesome and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 actually pretty cool just by 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.489
 seen the optics but by the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.830
 animations and probably that will 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 just like the roller it is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.880
 skills are not really different 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 look the hunger strike talks here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.310
 I check kite looks completely the same 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.439
 if you yell a little bit 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 wants to take a bit then disabled 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.869
 one has red gloves shining red 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 red take care of the poor around as well 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 like the other one we can look at 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 probably only start the multi 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.979
 probably complete here too 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.690
 will look the same and eternity in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.390
 we are here a little bit now 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.880
 the opponent must weaken the under 50 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.520
 bring 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.310
 So here we see no big 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.700
 Change that means west completely 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.409
 equals 750 liters cost it completely 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.820
 maybe not in the region either 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.310
 major changes just talk 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.950
 the optics that means we can now 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.720
 here our duel on the car and that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 I clearly want to lose even if I do 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.560
 I change I hope will think me 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 Of course, you can always grow because it's easy 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.200
 These are often pretty horny 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.200
 take care
