using Facebook this really wouldn't be a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.760 
using Facebook this really wouldn't be a
hard<00:02:27.370> sell<00:02:27.460> if<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:27.970> was<00:02:28.120> dirt<00:02:28.450> cheap<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.050> super

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
hard sell if it was dirt cheap and super

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.980 
hard sell if it was dirt cheap and super
easy<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.970> if<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.240> was<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> color<00:02:31.660> blue

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990
