00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.120
 How happy Sunday for everyone 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.130
 our friends from telemundo 51 puntocom 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.200
 also through our pages of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.059
 facebook and twitter we continue 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 talking about the tropical storm 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 Leslie Leslie continues quite wide 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.890
 but it does not have a defined center is that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 is fighting with the cutting winds 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 in height and this is what continues 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 preventing me from telling you to give you a little 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 more of intensity the good news of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 all this is that they are good lys 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 will keep on waters of the Atlantic without 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.450
 directly affect the portion of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 Caribbean, let alone portions of the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 American nation what we continue 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 speaking and affecting the nation 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.900
 American in particular towards the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.210
 ohio valley region that are the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.790
 remains of isaac and sant continues to leave 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.610
 torrential rains along the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.230
 state of indiana going on because in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
 touch and Mississippi also towards 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 northern portion of Mississippi and alabama like 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 we noticed here there have been some reports 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.620
 of torrential heavy rain 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 strong also precipitations to what 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.979
 throughout the region to also 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 floods which are already 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 reaching portions of the Atlantic 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.070
 they also continue under surveillance 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.200
 tornado in which it extends 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 practically from the portion of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.329
 tennessee passing through kentucky and all the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.039
 northern portion of mississippi alabama these 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.240
 rains will continue to affect this 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.780
 region for at least the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.759
 course of the next 12 to 24 hours 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.500
 towards our good area we continue with 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.909
 an extensive system of high pressure but 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 that some 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.020
 precipitation especially towards the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.939
 southern sector of miami dade county and some 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.039
 light drizzles and in the course of 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.189
 the afternoon they affected lots of miramar 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.140
 and of pender points notice these impulses 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 of moisture on the surface coming out 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 of the group of Bahamian islands these 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 precipitation will be moving 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 to the east and I do not rule out good anymore 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 as we see here some at this time of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.039
 the afternoon falling for the portion 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 metropolitan county of miami dade and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.030
 also southeast of bravard 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 we will continue with these isolated rains 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 and passengers in the course of this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.959
 night we do not expect big rain or 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.670
 torrential rains but if it rains 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.600
 passengers the wind has been mostly 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.330
 from the east 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.340
 10 to 15 miles per hour wind a bit 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.800
 lighter towards the corns sector 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.690
 the temperatures today remained a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.850
 little below normal but it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.190
 they felt quite hot and also 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.900
 there was a lot of steam while at levels 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.880
 means of the atmosphere we continue with 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 quite dry air but also to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.540
 average levels of the atmosphere 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.550
 we continue with some humidity impulses 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.020
 and that's what is supporting that 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.700
 develop these downpours in the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.740
 course of the next hours for 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.840
 today Sunday the low pressure system 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.270
 which is just over the portion of the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.710
 group of Bahamian islands at levels 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.930
 means of the atmosphere to be 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.580
 moving a little more towards our 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.710
 area what does this mean good that already 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.020
 the low pressure system brings some 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.230
 of humidity and instability so 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.880
 we can expect a weak increase to the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.910
 probability of showers for tomorrow the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.770
 Monday and also for Tuesday I do not wait 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.270
 that they are torrential rains throughout 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.090
 of the entire region but if we are going to have 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.560
 showers a little more pronounced in 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.510
 comparison to what we have had 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.520
 during the last days in the sector 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.170
 maritime in the surf currents go 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.060
 to be very very active so 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.140
 caution for bathers remember 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.290
 what if you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.200
 is stuck in one of these streams 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.959
 of hangover it is very important that you do not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.630
 exalt that nothing parallel to the coast 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.069
 do not swim against the current and once 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.170
 that has already left this current 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.970
 of hangover is when you can start 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.920
 to swim to the coast the wind will be 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.140
 mostly from the east for 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 boats of 8 or 13 knots in the sea 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.790
 with a swell of up to 2 feet and the bay 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.709
 slightly moderate the forecast to 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.150
 long term good we will continue with this 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.950
 risk of downpours thanks to the system 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.810
 of low pressure in middle levels of the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.060
 atmosphere for Monday and for Tuesday 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.070
 and on Wednesday onwards good 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.110
 we will begin to fall into this typical pattern 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.940
 summer of the downpours and storms 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.190
 in the afternoon mostly towards the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.170
 inside and we can expect that the 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.820
 temperatures sit a little bit a 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.070
 little bit below normal for the 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.050
 and Tuesday and Wednesday and from 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.540
 Thursday the temperatures again 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.630
 exceeding 90 degrees and you will feel 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.060
 very warm I wish you a very happy 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.100
 Sunday and also a very happy Monday day 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.790
 Holiday to enjoy as a family and 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.790
 healthily
