00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.740
 Now the percentage of reviews traveled by lantern from 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.939
 but also a correspondent 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.779
 and another aspect of the UAH market 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.409
 second half of 2000 x 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.289
 tenth year 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.960
 also series 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 with standards 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 I suspect I'll show how it works 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 what we have 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.260
 in this box 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.430
 0 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.330
 equipment includes 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 reconstruction warranty card 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.850
 violations of workers on the rings 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 and fanatic himself 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 the lantern itself is very small 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 only 44 grams 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.690
 four 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.030
 made under 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 battery 123 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 making nak top level 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.570
 piskun drive 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.570
 in this design in which 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.450
 not necessarily a button is passed 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.100
 directly on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.380
 spring loaded floating contacts 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.010
 in this way 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.510
 switches 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 what's the mode 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 in the ditch section is very and bright for 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690
 in turn sizes 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.820
 200 million 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.090
 200 any interest on such an item 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.090
 food is able to provide one hour 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 at minimum mode 5 million 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.840
 so capable 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.510
 issue for eight 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.750
 ten o'clock 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060
 percent 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.240
 the second can stand on a flat surface 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.229
 percent 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.859
 reflector who is weak 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.859
 textured 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.989
 spot without bright 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.870
 pronounced hot spot he r on big 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.889
 giving distance from a distance 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 almost uniformly lit 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.279
 whole construction 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.739
 whole 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.420
 strong but suitable for active species 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.429
 but codec h 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:42.420
 for daily 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.420
 in nose mode 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.289
 I really love this manufacturer and from 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.639
 Polish pleasure every time we 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.829
 show about the novelty because each 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.309
 new p 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.869
 it's still 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.239
 the result 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.149
 good work 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.099
 and I already more than once 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.269
 and performers 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:06.860
 this orgy
