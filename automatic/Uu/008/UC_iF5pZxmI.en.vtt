there's<00:00:14.800> no<00:00:14.920> denying<00:00:15.190> that<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.430> crosscut<00:00:15.700> sled

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
there's no denying that a crosscut sled

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.609 
there's no denying that a crosscut sled
is<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.330> very<00:00:16.540> important<00:00:16.930> tool<00:00:17.080> in<00:00:17.200> the<00:00:17.260> woodshop

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
is a very important tool in the woodshop

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.380 
is a very important tool in the woodshop
and<00:00:17.920> it's<00:00:18.340> also<00:00:18.520> very<00:00:18.670> important<00:00:19.180> that<00:00:19.210> we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
and it's also very important that we

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.179 
and it's also very important that we
have<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.540> nice<00:00:19.750> square<00:00:20.110> fence<00:00:20.500> for<00:00:20.800> accurate

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
have a nice square fence for accurate

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.160 
have a nice square fence for accurate
cuts<00:00:21.460> there<00:00:22.060> are<00:00:22.150> only<00:00:22.240> two<00:00:22.480> methods<00:00:22.900> that<00:00:23.020> I'm

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
cuts there are only two methods that I'm

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.010 
cuts there are only two methods that I'm
aware<00:00:23.440> of<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.710> you<00:00:24.039> can<00:00:24.190> use<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.670> calibrate<00:00:25.570> a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
aware of that you can use to calibrate a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.429 
aware of that you can use to calibrate a
table<00:00:26.470> saw<00:00:26.590> sled<00:00:26.650> fence<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.369> 90<00:00:27.670> degrees<00:00:28.029> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
table saw sled fence to 90 degrees and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.019 
table saw sled fence to 90 degrees and
probably<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:29.560> most<00:00:29.680> popular<00:00:29.770> method<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.760> the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
probably the most popular method is the

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.479 
probably the most popular method is the
five<00:00:31.539> cut<00:00:31.810> method<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.949> second<00:00:33.309> method

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
five cut method the second method

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.400 
five cut method the second method
involves<00:00:34.059> using<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.420> dial<00:00:34.629> indicator<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:35.350> a

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
involves using a dial indicator and a

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.200 
involves using a dial indicator and a
square<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.070> I've<00:00:36.190> done<00:00:36.400> with<00:00:36.580> that<00:00:36.760> method<00:00:37.090> in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
square and I've done with that method in

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.210 
square and I've done with that method in
the<00:00:37.300> past<00:00:37.540> so<00:00:38.320> what<00:00:38.470> I'd<00:00:38.559> like<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.710> do<00:00:38.890> today<00:00:39.070> is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
the past so what I'd like to do today is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.380 
the past so what I'd like to do today is
just<00:00:39.640> kind<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.879> do<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.030> head-to-head

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
just kind of do a head-to-head

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.840 
just kind of do a head-to-head
comparison<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.229> these<00:00:41.320> two<00:00:41.379> methods<00:00:41.979> from

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
comparison of these two methods from

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.329 
comparison of these two methods from
both<00:00:43.089> a<00:00:43.300> time<00:00:43.659> perspective<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:44.650> an<00:00:44.890> accuracy

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
both a time perspective and an accuracy

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.910 
both a time perspective and an accuracy
perspective<00:00:46.089> and<00:00:46.360> just<00:00:46.390> kind<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.199> see<00:00:47.409> which

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
perspective and just kind of see which

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.579 
perspective and just kind of see which
method<00:00:48.159> comes<00:00:48.850> out<00:00:49.000> ahead<00:00:49.269> with<00:00:49.989> with<00:00:50.260> regard

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
method comes out ahead with with regard

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.070 
method comes out ahead with with regard
to<00:00:50.710> those<00:00:50.860> two<00:00:51.129> aspects<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:52.479> purpose<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.989> this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
to those two aspects the purpose of this

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.020 
to those two aspects the purpose of this
comparison<00:00:53.500> is<00:00:53.769> not<00:00:53.830> to<00:00:54.159> belittle<00:00:54.460> either

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
comparison is not to belittle either

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.430 
comparison is not to belittle either
method<00:00:55.479> but<00:00:55.690> just<00:00:55.839> to<00:00:55.930> see<00:00:56.110> which<00:00:56.229> method

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
method but just to see which method

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.340 
method but just to see which method
comes<00:00:56.830> out<00:00:57.040> on<00:00:57.250> top<00:00:57.489> after<00:00:58.030> an<00:00:58.540> honest<00:00:58.900> review

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
comes out on top after an honest review

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.229 
comes out on top after an honest review
so<00:00:59.949> what<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.100> plan<00:01:00.159> on<00:01:00.339> doing<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.790> going<00:01:00.970> through

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
so what I plan on doing is going through

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.820 
so what I plan on doing is going through
all<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.570> steps<00:01:01.869> that<00:01:02.110> are<00:01:02.140> involved<00:01:02.650> in<00:01:02.710> a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
all the steps that are involved in a

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.270 
all the steps that are involved in a
five<00:01:03.010> cut<00:01:03.280> method<00:01:03.489> on<00:01:03.850> camera<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:06.040> kind

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
five cut method on camera and just kind

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.950 
five cut method on camera and just kind
of<00:01:06.340> time<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:06.880> see<00:01:07.330> how<00:01:07.540> long<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.930> takes

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
of time it and see how long it takes

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840 
of time it and see how long it takes
then<00:01:08.860> what<00:01:09.010> I'm<00:01:09.100> going<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.280> do<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.610> show<00:01:09.760> you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
then what I'm going to do is show you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.520 
then what I'm going to do is show you
the<00:01:09.909> method<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.329> I<00:01:10.390> prefer<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.990> use<00:01:11.020> which

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
the method that I prefer to use which

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.380 
the method that I prefer to use which
involves<00:01:12.039> using<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.399> dial<00:01:12.670> indicator<00:01:13.119> and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
involves using a dial indicator and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.139 
involves using a dial indicator and
again<00:01:14.079> I'm<00:01:14.200> going<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.350> go<00:01:14.469> through<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.799> steps

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
again I'm going to go through the steps

00:01:15.149 --> 00:02:00.090 
again I'm going to go through the steps
involved<00:01:16.149> in<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.329> process<00:01:16.649> again<00:01:17.649> on<00:01:17.799> camera

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.200 

okay<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.159> now<00:02:01.460> what<00:02:01.549> I'm<00:02:01.670> supposed<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.909> do<00:02:02.090> is

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
okay so now what I'm supposed to do is

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.109 
okay so now what I'm supposed to do is
remove<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.630> screw<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:04.250> securing<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
remove this screw that's securing the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:14.009 
remove this screw that's securing the
fence<00:02:07.269> move<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.450> fence<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> required<00:02:09.619> amount

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.280 

for<00:02:15.019> argument's<00:02:15.530> sake<00:02:15.680> let's<00:02:15.950> assume<00:02:16.700> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
for argument's sake let's assume that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.530 
for argument's sake let's assume that
I'm<00:02:18.290> moving<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.799> fence<00:02:19.129> by<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> required

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
I'm moving this fence by the required

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.809 
I'm moving this fence by the required
amount<00:02:23.709> put<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.890> clamp<00:02:25.190> back<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:27.760> now<00:02:28.760> we

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
amount put this clamp back on now we

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.039 
amount put this clamp back on now we
need<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:31.299> countersink<00:02:32.299> for<00:02:32.569> our<00:02:32.660> new<00:02:32.810> hole

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
need to countersink for our new hole

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.350 
need to countersink for our new hole
because<00:02:33.799> I've<00:02:33.950> moved<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.459> position<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
because I've moved the position of the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:59.040 
because I've moved the position of the
fence<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.349> drill<00:02:45.739> for<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> hole

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.780 

now<00:03:00.050> we<00:03:00.230> got<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:01.780> sink<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.960> screw<00:03:03.350> in<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:03.920> secure

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
now we got a sink the screw in to secure

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.110 
now we got a sink the screw in to secure
the<00:03:04.970> fence<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.360> their<00:03:05.480> new<00:03:05.600> position<00:03:07.120> assuming

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the fence in their new position assuming

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
the fence in their new position assuming
we<00:03:08.300> have<00:03:08.330> it<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:08.960> spot<00:03:14.230> now<00:03:15.230> all<00:03:15.440> we

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
we have it in the right spot now all we

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.230 
we have it in the right spot now all we
need<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.860> do<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.220> redo<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.730> five<00:03:16.880> cutting

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
need to do is redo the five cutting

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.840 
need to do is redo the five cutting
method<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.570> make<00:03:17.690> sure<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.140> we<00:03:18.380> are<00:03:18.850> ninety

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
method to make sure that we are ninety

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:38.150 
method to make sure that we are ninety
degrees

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.590 

if<00:03:39.160> I'm<00:03:39.400> not<00:03:39.550> happy<00:03:39.910> with<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> alignment<00:03:40.569> of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
if I'm not happy with the alignment of

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.380 
if I'm not happy with the alignment of
my<00:03:40.750> fence<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.350> need<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.800> remove<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.370> screw<00:03:42.700> move

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
my fence I need to remove the screw move

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.840 
my fence I need to remove the screw move
the<00:03:43.630> fence<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.080> another<00:03:44.350> position<00:03:44.610> drill<00:03:45.610> for

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
the fence to another position drill for

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.940 
the fence to another position drill for
a<00:03:45.880> new<00:03:46.060> hole<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.600> repeat<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.530> five<00:03:47.680> cut

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
a new hole and repeat the five cut

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.530 
a new hole and repeat the five cut
method<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.700> process<00:03:49.120> I'm<00:03:49.209> going<00:03:49.240> to<00:03:49.420> show

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
method so the process I'm going to show

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.030 
method so the process I'm going to show
you<00:03:49.600> now<00:03:49.840> involves<00:03:50.350> using<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.680> dial<00:03:50.890> indicator

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
you now involves using a dial indicator

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
you now involves using a dial indicator
and<00:03:51.640> they<00:03:51.819> use<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.120> very<00:03:52.360> little<00:03:52.569> trial<00:03:53.319> and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
and they use this very little trial and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:27.810 
and they use this very little trial and
error

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.980 

so<00:04:28.820> now<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.030> I'm<00:04:29.240> certain<00:04:29.570> that<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:29.870> no

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
so now that I'm certain that I have no

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.550 
so now that I'm certain that I have no
movement<00:04:30.200> in<00:04:30.440> my<00:04:30.530> dial<00:04:30.800> all<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.190> need<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.460> do<00:04:31.580> now

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
movement in my dial all I need to do now

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:46.350 
movement in my dial all I need to do now
is<00:04:33.560> put<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.890> clamp<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.760> fence

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:05:04.290 

and<00:04:47.580> countersink<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.789> hole<00:05:03.120> so<00:05:04.120> if<00:05:04.180> you're

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
and countersink for a hole so if you're

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.850 
and countersink for a hole so if you're
like<00:05:04.419> me<00:05:04.569> probably<00:05:04.930> go<00:05:05.199> back<00:05:05.349> and<00:05:05.620> check<00:05:05.800> just

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
like me probably go back and check just

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.830 
like me probably go back and check just
to<00:05:06.189> make<00:05:06.400> sure<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.909> you<00:05:07.330> didn't<00:05:07.539> move<00:05:07.659> the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
to make sure that you didn't move the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.450 
to make sure that you didn't move the
fence<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.289> process<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.889> driving<00:05:09.129> in<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
fence in the process of driving in the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.089 
fence in the process of driving in the
screw<00:05:09.759> so<00:05:09.939> let's<00:05:10.090> go<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.360> check<00:05:10.830> no<00:05:11.830> movement

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
screw so let's go and check no movement

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.659 
screw so let's go and check no movement
and<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.789> dial<00:05:13.000> indicator<00:05:13.389> phase
