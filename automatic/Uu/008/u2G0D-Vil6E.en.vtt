and<00:00:03.430> one<00:00:03.610> of<00:00:03.700> the<00:00:03.760> things<00:00:04.000> that<00:00:04.180> I<00:00:04.270> did<00:00:04.510> was<00:00:04.660> I

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
and one of the things that I did was I

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.299 
and one of the things that I did was I
use<00:00:04.960> the<00:00:05.109> Toyota<00:00:05.529> service<00:00:06.220> information<00:00:08.309> that

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
use the Toyota service information that

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.759 
use the Toyota service information that
that<00:00:10.090> we<00:00:10.240> have<00:00:10.480> we<00:00:10.750> have<00:00:10.900> access<00:00:11.410> to<00:00:11.469> their

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
that we have we have access to their

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.740 
that we have we have access to their
their<00:00:12.190> technical<00:00:12.669> service<00:00:13.000> information<00:00:13.269> and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
their technical service information and

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.790 
their technical service information and
I<00:00:13.780> started<00:00:14.139> looking<00:00:14.500> for<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.540> know<00:00:16.660> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
I started looking for you know a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.400 
I started looking for you know a
probable<00:00:17.800> spot<00:00:18.280> or<00:00:18.640> a<00:00:18.670> potential<00:00:19.450> area<00:00:19.990> where

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
probable spot or a potential area where

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.740 
probable spot or a potential area where
this<00:00:20.980> might<00:00:21.340> occur<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.970> since<00:00:22.600> the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
this might occur and since the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
this might occur and since the
accelerator<00:00:23.260> pedal<00:00:23.640> position<00:00:24.690> sensing<00:00:25.690> is<00:00:26.100> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
accelerator pedal position sensing is so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369 
accelerator pedal position sensing is so
important<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.600> this<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:29.800> type<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:31.259> you<00:00:32.259> know

systems that's where we began and first
off<00:00:39.760> we<00:00:40.030> introduced<00:00:40.510> some<00:00:40.720> different<00:00:41.020> types

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
off we introduced some different types

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.400 
off we introduced some different types
of<00:00:41.880> circuit<00:00:42.880> resistances<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.810> falls<00:00:44.050> and

that<00:00:45.370> sort<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.670> thing<00:00:47.220> at<00:00:48.220> some<00:00:48.790> point<00:00:49.290> we

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
that sort of thing at some point we

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.360 
that sort of thing at some point we

going to enter into the failsafe mode at
some<00:01:15.340> point<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:18.369> started<00:01:18.700> experimenting<00:01:19.209> with

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
some point we started experimenting with

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.199 
some point we started experimenting with
some<00:01:19.659> different<00:01:19.929> combinations<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:20.740> things

some different combinations of things

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.319 
some different combinations of things
that<00:01:22.209> could<00:01:22.420> probably<00:01:22.770> call<00:01:23.770> or<00:01:24.069> that<00:01:24.329> may

that could probably call or that may

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.969 
that could probably call or that may
have<00:01:25.569> the<00:01:25.749> potential<00:01:26.200> I<00:01:26.499> guess<00:01:26.709> would<00:01:26.889> be

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
have the potential I guess would be

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.359 
have the potential I guess would be
whether<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.399> have<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:28.090> potential<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.759> be

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
whether that have the potential to to be

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.769 
whether that have the potential to to be
to<00:01:33.369> push<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.789> system<00:01:34.029> to<00:01:34.810> wide<00:01:34.990> open<00:01:35.350> throttle

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
to push the system to wide open throttle

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:40.679 
to push the system to wide open throttle
to<00:01:37.779> put<00:01:38.439> it<00:01:38.560> into<00:01:38.829> Olympian<00:01:39.279> mode<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:40.270> reduce

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
to put it into Olympian mode to reduce

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.359 
to put it into Olympian mode to reduce
power<00:01:40.929> and<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.289> sort<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.590> thing<00:01:41.829> those<00:01:42.189> are

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
power and that sort of thing those are

power and that sort of thing those are
the<00:01:42.429> things<00:01:42.639> that<00:01:42.789> I<00:01:42.939> look<00:01:43.119> for<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:44.380> quick<00:01:44.740> can

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the things that I look for how quick can

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.529 
the things that I look for how quick can
it<00:01:45.099> detect<00:01:45.520> these<00:01:45.700> different<00:01:46.149> types<00:01:46.359> of

it detect these different types of

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.770 
it detect these different types of
faults<00:01:46.749> and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.670 
the strategy of the Toyota systems
there's<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.039> window<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.640> opportunity<00:02:09.759> there

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
there's a window of opportunity there

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.430 
there's a window of opportunity there
where<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.520> could<00:02:12.790> occur<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:14.140> will<00:02:14.410> be

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
where that could occur and not will be

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.699 
where that could occur and not will be
detected<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.670> was<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.050> reason<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.530> went

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
detected and that was the reason I went

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.540 
detected and that was the reason I went
to<00:02:17.830> Washington<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:19.739> think<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.280> presents

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
to Washington I think this this presents

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.479 
to Washington I think this this presents
a<00:02:21.850> great<00:02:22.060> opportunity<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.750> Toyota<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:23.860> if

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
a great opportunity for Toyota if if

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.120 
a great opportunity for Toyota if if
they<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:24.910> work<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.300> us<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:26.100> continue<00:02:27.100> to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
they can work with us to continue to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.210 
they can work with us to continue to
support<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.670> program<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.220> win-win
