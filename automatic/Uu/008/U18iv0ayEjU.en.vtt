00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.219
 Javier Zanetti is constancy and 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.030
 excellence with more than 800 matches in the 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.189
 Inter de Milan 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.740
 the pupi prepares for a new 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.400
 season I find good with many 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.250
 desire 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 to feel still useful for my team 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.170
 and I'm recovering a lesson from 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.419
 term of achilles is what may 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 return as soon as possible has arrived 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.340
 a very capable technician 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 where are you from, you had the truth that always 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 worked very well and hopefully the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.050
 results can also be here on 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 event is in us to be able to translate into 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 the court the coach's idea that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 I hope we can do a great 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.320
 championship standing out at an early age 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 maximum moratti inter owner did not hesitate 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.860
 in bringing him to his team when he was going to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.370
 turning 21 years old the truth that I do not 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.410
 I expected all that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.600
 very fast in the middle also the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.360
 Argentine selection were all things 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.530
 beautiful ones that helped me grow 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.470
 only as a player but as a person 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.780
 because there comes a country where I had been 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.630
 always protected and the truth that mission 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.450
 feel like in my house 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.130
 and today if I start looking back 'this is 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 very proud very pleased the load that 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.470
 I'm making my relationship with the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.259
 president is going towards a relationship 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.759
 from president to player is a relationship 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.100
 much more personal much more human 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.979
 because our president has a great 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.679
 heart and the truth that for me is a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.110
 I like to continue defending the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.369
 colors of this society of this club and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.659
 especially because it is we have the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.090
 professional responsibility captain 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 in 2010 by the hand of jose mourinho 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.909
 the inter won everything in italy by closing 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.829
 that golden stage with the champions this 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.829
 year left me an unforgettable memory 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.270
 If you did not see everything 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.460
 also we become part of the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.040
 history as the first Italian club in 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.330
 to be able to make the triplet and that's going to 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.170
 be marked in history for 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.810
 always and with the privilege of being the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.750
 captain and I can lift this trophy 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.170
 jose mourinho a great a great in everything 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.720
 felt a very very capable technician very 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.410
 winner frontal 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.320
 very prepared I think the work that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.690
 we did together it was very good and it's going to 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.060
 also be in the hearts of the people 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.460
 with historical mark as captain of the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.200
 Argentine selection olympic games and 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.660
 two cups of the world play with the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.150
 albiceleste has been its highest point 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.800
 Despite the bitter moments makes 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.700
 be Argentine from always of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.310
 measures because they were 17 years 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.190
 defending those colors with the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.090
 privilege of having also been for 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 moments the captain 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.390
 I always said that there is nothing more beautiful 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.090
 to be able to defend the colors of your 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.110
 country anywhere in the world I 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.050
 I had that luck 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.860
 there were many parties the truth that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.450
 always for me it was an honor 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.720
 every time I played the hymn 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.720
 after being able to play for my selection if 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.210
 it happened to me in 2 in 2006 of 2010 I had 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.650
 all the eliminatory ones and missing few 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 months they left me out but good 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.610
 you would have to ask him to apply more 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.710
 that Maradona is really what 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.150
 happened what leaves me calm that I did 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.950
 everything possible to be able to be 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.209
 after when the efficiency does not depend 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.209
 I can not do anything about myself 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.800
 defender of lionel messi at all times 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.860
 zanetti has full confidence in the 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.230
 current incredible campus that a player 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.530
 as messi our country has been discussed 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.540
 but that is part of the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.210
 Argentine ideology that is very successful 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.640
 so 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.250
 we also went through that the world cup is 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.040
 always difficult and I think the best 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.380
 elections to make candidates always 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.110
 so I think that 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.520
 Argentina has a team like to 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.000
 to be able to fight in the last 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.010
 instances 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.780
 I like it a lot, I like it a lot because 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.270
 is very well prepared has a 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.830
 very intelligent coach very capable and 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.959
 has the best in the world that is months and 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.750
 I hope that in Brazil I can give it to him 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.520
 with the withdrawal in sight the pupi follows 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.880
 leaving a legacy in the neroazzurro club 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.850
 with a relationship that you plan to continue 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.240
 long years of the bridge of hopefully 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.140
 can be a leader and keep feeling 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.230
 useful and important also the development 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.880
 it happens all for the desire with passion 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.670
 with the delivery for the responsibility of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.280
 of what we do and one always wants 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.910
 be one hundred percent to be able to 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.550
 I said before 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.580
 feel useful and make my 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.550
 buddies and micro so one treats 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.830
 always give the best first during 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.570
 a workout and then inside a 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.570
 field of play and that was my whole career
