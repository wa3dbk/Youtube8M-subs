00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.919 

okay<00:00:01.860> some<00:00:02.070> really<00:00:02.370> good<00:00:02.520> situations<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.689> I

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay some really good situations today I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay some really good situations today I
thought<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.879> it<00:00:05.879> was<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> really<00:00:06.270> good

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
thought that it was a really good

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.450 
thought that it was a really good
practice<00:00:07.080> as<00:00:07.230> far<00:00:07.470> as<00:00:07.589> learning<00:00:07.830> from<00:00:08.220> things

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
practice as far as learning from things

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.280 
practice as far as learning from things
not<00:00:08.670> necessarily<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.240> best<00:00:09.389> practice<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:10.080> far

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
not necessarily the best practice as far

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.160 
not necessarily the best practice as far
as<00:00:10.440> our<00:00:10.860> performance<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> lot<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> things

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
as our performance but a lot of things

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
as our performance but a lot of things
happen<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.040> lot<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.309> different<00:00:14.340> situations

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
happen in a lot of different situations

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.950 
happen in a lot of different situations
there<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.830> coming<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.570> resonance

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
there in coming out in some resonance

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.290 
there in coming out in some resonance
situations<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.730> learn<00:00:20.970> from

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
situations that we can really learn from

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
situations that we can really learn from
next<00:00:22.109> time<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.470> were<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> those<00:00:22.859> situations

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
next time that were in those situations

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
next time that were in those situations
so<00:00:23.730> thought<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.630> very<00:00:24.689> valuable<00:00:25.019> now

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so thought that was very valuable now

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
so thought that was very valuable now
obviously<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.400> need<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> learn<00:00:26.730> from<00:00:26.970> those

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
obviously we need to learn from those

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
obviously we need to learn from those
situations<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.740> come<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:29.130> with

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
situations so when it was come up with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
situations so when it was come up with
master<00:00:29.910> those<00:00:30.090> situations<00:00:32.690> could<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.750> live

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
master those situations could you live

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.979 
master those situations could you live
it<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.710> needed<00:00:34.980> by<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
it a little of what you needed by that

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.299 
it a little of what you needed by that
well<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.620> individual

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
well I'm not going to go an individual

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
well I'm not going to go an individual
player<00:00:38.790> detail<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:39.989> certain

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
player detail but there are certain

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
player detail but there are certain
things<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.710> certain<00:00:40.890> situations<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.820> coming

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
things in certain situations like coming

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.729 
things in certain situations like coming
out<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.690> learn<00:00:42.989> from<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.500> hurt<00:00:43.710> us

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
out that we can learn from that hurt us

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
out that we can learn from that hurt us
in<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> situation<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.180> good

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
in that situation and there's some good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
in that situation and there's some good
things<00:00:45.570> too<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.440> happened<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.370> those

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
things too that happened in those

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.690 
things too that happened in those
situations<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.899> there's<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:49.700> some

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
situations and then there's also some

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.979 
situations and then there's also some
things<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> defensive<00:00:51.570> side<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> ball

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
things on the defensive side of the ball

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
things on the defensive side of the ball
not<00:00:52.289> understanding<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> down<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> distance

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
not understanding the down and distance

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.900 
not understanding the down and distance
exactly<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> backed-up<00:00:55.770> situation<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
exactly in a backed-up situation and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
exactly in a backed-up situation and
giving<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.719> big<00:00:57.899> play<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
giving up a big play because of not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
giving up a big play because of not
understanding<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> knowing<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.410> they

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
understanding that the knowing that they

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
understanding that the knowing that they
go<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> third<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.980> 14<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.899> all<00:01:03.899> those

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
go to third and 14 so all those

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.390 
go to third and 14 so all those
different<00:01:04.379> situations<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.159> come<00:01:05.339> up

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
different situations that come up

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.740 
different situations that come up
putting<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> last<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.630> of

putting the last one there of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
putting the last one there of
understanding<00:01:07.320> controlling<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> ball<00:01:08.070> when

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
understanding controlling the ball when

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
understanding controlling the ball when
all<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> often<00:01:09.420> seen<00:01:09.600> Oh<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> field<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.290> to
