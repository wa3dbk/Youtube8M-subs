00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
sea to go fishing so the drum was a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.770

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
of it that you have to use all the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.630 
of it that you have to use all the
different<00:02:03.299> parts<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.780> body<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.770> mind<00:02:04.830> in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
different parts of body and mind in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.430 
different parts of body and mind in
order<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.970> play<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.299> title<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.290> also

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
order to play the title and it also

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320 
order to play the title and it also
helps<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.190> connect<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.819> Japanese

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600 
helps me to connect with my Japanese
roots<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.400> biggest

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
roots as well I think the biggest

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
roots as well I think the biggest
challenge<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.120> any<00:02:12.360> group<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.140> when

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
challenge for any group is that when

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.309 
challenge for any group is that when
you're<00:02:13.770> playing<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.340> an<00:02:14.490> ensemble<00:02:15.319> everyone

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
you're playing as an ensemble everyone

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.020 
you're playing as an ensemble everyone
has<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.010> same<00:02:17.220> page<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.880> have

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
has to be on the same page you all have

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
has to be on the same page you all have
to<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.209> playing<00:02:18.480> together<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.709> there's<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to be playing together so if there's a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.059 
to be playing together so if there's a
weaker<00:02:20.700> player<00:02:20.940> sometimes<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.200> song<00:02:22.739> can't

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
weaker player sometimes the song can't

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.920 
weaker player sometimes the song can't
sound<00:02:23.280> very<00:02:23.610> good

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
sound very good

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.199 
sound very good
so<00:02:24.930> everyone<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.620> has<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.970> at<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
so everyone all has to be kind of at the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.570 
so everyone all has to be kind of at the
same<00:02:27.420> level<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.930> plane<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.370> same

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
same level of plane and the same

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.420 
same level of plane and the same
mentality<00:02:30.290> also<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> drums<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.800> very<00:02:31.950> big<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
go and that's quite challenging to move

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.530 
go and that's quite challenging to move
all<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.620> equipment<00:02:38.010> around<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.330> fly
