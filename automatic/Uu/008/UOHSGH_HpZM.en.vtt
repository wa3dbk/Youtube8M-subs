so<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.199> evaluating<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:02.750> XL<00:00:03.859> 6006<00:00:04.859> based<00:00:05.730> LED

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
so I'm evaluating the XL 6006 based LED

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.240 
so I'm evaluating the XL 6006 based LED
driver<00:00:06.750> sepak<00:00:07.880> LED<00:00:08.880> driver<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.010> I'm<00:00:11.010> looking

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
driver sepak LED driver and I'm looking

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.490 
driver sepak LED driver and I'm looking
at<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.550> feedback<00:00:12.150> pin<00:00:12.420> pin<00:00:12.690> 5<00:00:12.990> i've<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
at the feedback pin pin 5 i've got the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.769 
at the feedback pin pin 5 i've got the
scope<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.980> there<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.660> what<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
scope on there and what I can see is the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.859 
scope on there and what I can see is the
490<00:00:18.779> Hertz<00:00:19.550> frequency<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> pulse<00:00:21.720> width

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
490 Hertz frequency of the pulse width

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.560 
490 Hertz frequency of the pulse width

if<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.750> turn<00:00:25.609> pwm<00:00:26.609> value<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.480> bit<00:00:27.630> lower<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
if I turn pwm value a little bit lower I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.800 
if I turn pwm value a little bit lower I
can<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.550> rid<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> switching<00:00:30.779> frequency

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can get rid of the switching frequency

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.889 
can get rid of the switching frequency
of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:33.590> driver<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> 490

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
of the driver and just have the 490

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.780 
of the driver and just have the 490
hurts<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> see<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
hurts and you can see there that the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
hurts and you can see there that the
scope<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> picking<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> 490<00:00:40.890> Hertz

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100

little bit of trouble locking on now let

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.250 
little bit of trouble locking on now let
me<00:01:01.800> take<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.100> all<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.110> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
me take it all the way up so that it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.609 
me take it all the way up so that it's
full<00:01:04.769> brightness<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.290> bit<00:01:07.439> difficult

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
full brightness and it's a bit difficult

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
full brightness and it's a bit difficult
to<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.520> scopes<00:01:08.820> being<00:01:09.320> blotted

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to see because the scopes being blotted

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
to see because the scopes being blotted
out<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> LEDs<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.760> I'll<00:01:11.939> wind<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
out by the LEDs but I'll wind up the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
out by the LEDs but I'll wind up the
time<00:01:13.650> base<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
time base and you can see there the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
time base and you can see there the
waveform<00:01:17.549> let's<00:01:18.000> come<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.860> the

waveform let's come over the side of the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.210 
waveform let's come over the side of the
switch<00:01:20.250> mode<00:01:20.430> converter<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:22.619> reading

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
switch mode converter and it's reading

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.499 
switch mode converter and it's reading
on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> frequency<00:01:23.700> scale<00:01:24.830> 188<00:01:25.830> kilohertz

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
on the frequency scale 188 kilohertz

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.819 
on the frequency scale 188 kilohertz
that's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.930> high<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that's a little bit high because the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
that's a little bit high because the
data<00:01:29.009> sheet<00:01:29.340> says<00:01:30.259> where<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.900> yes<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
data sheet says where is it yes in the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640 
data sheet says where is it yes in the
middle<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.560> fixed<00:01:35.100> 180<00:01:35.939> kilohertz

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
middle there fixed 180 kilohertz

middle there fixed 180 kilohertz
switching<00:01:37.650> frequency<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.400> ok<00:01:38.640> I'm

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
switching frequency well ok I'm

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.830 
switching frequency well ok I'm
measuring<00:01:39.110> 188<00:01:40.110> kilohertz<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
measuring 188 kilohertz but there it is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.520 
measuring 188 kilohertz but there it is
now<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> scope<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
now the scope is on you can see it that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
now the scope is on you can see it that
you<00:01:46.619> can't<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:46.890> anyway<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.280> saying<00:01:47.840> 500

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you can't but anyway it's saying 500

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can't but anyway it's saying 500
millivolts<00:01:49.110> per<00:01:49.409> division<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.119> 2

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
millivolts per division so what about 2

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.469 
millivolts per division so what about 2
volts<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:54.140> voltage<00:01:55.140> span<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.939> switching

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
volts of voltage span on that switching

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.469 
volts of voltage span on that switching
frequency<00:01:58.310> which<00:01:59.310> sure<00:01:59.640> which<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.149> about

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
frequency which sure which is about

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200 
frequency which sure which is about
right<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> guess<00:02:01.399> now<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> was<00:02:02.939> thinking

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
right I guess now what I was thinking

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
right I guess now what I was thinking
about<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.540> yesterday<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.140> realized<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.649> I'd

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
about this yesterday I realized that I'd

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.700 
about this yesterday I realized that I'd
got<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> current<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> 1.2<00:02:07.469> volt

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
got the current from that 1.2 volt

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
got the current from that 1.2 volt
battery<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:09.300> through<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.690> opto

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
isolator the wrong way it was going from

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.000 
isolator the wrong way it was going from

the<00:02:14.159> collector<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.709> didn't<00:02:16.709> realize

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
the collector I didn't realize

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.080 
the collector I didn't realize
transistors<00:02:17.370> could<00:02:17.549> work<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:17.879> but

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
transistors could work like that but

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.759 
transistors could work like that but
anyway<00:02:18.329> that's<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.659> seemed<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> be

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
anyway that's what seemed to be

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.130 
anyway that's what seemed to be
happening<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.849> now<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.209> I've<00:02:21.329> rewired<00:02:21.870> it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
happening and now that I've rewired it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
happening and now that I've rewired it
so<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.799> in<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.920> normal

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
so that it's going in the normal

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.429 
so that it's going in the normal
direction<00:02:23.810> collector<00:02:24.810> through<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.140> emitter

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
direction collector through to emitter

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.210 
direction collector through to emitter
it<00:02:26.280> does<00:02:26.519> seem<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.680> brightness<00:02:28.680> control

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it does seem that the brightness control

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.690 
it does seem that the brightness control
is<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.900> more<00:02:31.110> linear<00:02:31.489> don't<00:02:32.489> have

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
is a little bit more linear don't have

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.740 
is a little bit more linear don't have
that<00:02:32.989> strange<00:02:33.989> jumping<00:02:34.829> brightness<00:02:35.599> but<00:02:36.599> what

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that strange jumping brightness but what

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380 
that strange jumping brightness but what
you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:36.959> from<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.739> scope<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> LEDs

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you can see from the scope and the LEDs

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
you can see from the scope and the LEDs
is<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.370> LEDs<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:41.819> off<00:02:42.829> completely<00:02:43.829> when

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
is that the LEDs go off completely when

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.339 
is that the LEDs go off completely when
the<00:02:44.760> PWM<00:02:45.359> is<00:02:45.659> about<00:02:46.430> ten<00:02:47.430> percent<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:48.349> little

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
the PWM is about ten percent a little

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.690 
the PWM is about ten percent a little
bit<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:49.560> than<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.159> can<00:02:50.400> see<00:02:50.549> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
bit more than that and you can see the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.849 
bit more than that and you can see the
switching<00:02:51.150> frequency<00:02:51.359> I<00:02:51.840> put<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.379> here<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
switching frequency I put up here the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.460 
switching frequency I put up here the
LEDs<00:02:53.250> come<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> LEDs<00:02:55.170> go<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
LEDs come on and then the LEDs go to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.599 
LEDs come on and then the LEDs go to
full<00:02:55.799> brightness<00:02:56.269> when<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.450> PWM<00:02:58.159> gets<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.310> one

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
full brightness when the PWM gets to one

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.819 
full brightness when the PWM gets to one
hundred<00:02:59.700> percent<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.019> kind<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.379> ten

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
hundred percent so it's kind of ten

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.520 
hundred percent so it's kind of ten
percent<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> hundred<00:03:02.849> percent<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
percent to a hundred percent is the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.460 
percent to a hundred percent is the
range<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:05.129> PWM<00:03:05.819> control<00:03:07.069> now<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.299> fall<00:03:09.470> time

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
range of PWM control now the fall time

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.369 
range of PWM control now the fall time
is<00:03:10.920> rather<00:03:11.510> long<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.139> there's<00:03:13.319> a

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
is rather long you can see there's a

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.879 
is rather long you can see there's a
rather<00:03:13.560> nasty<00:03:14.030> curve<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.659> drop<00:03:16.409> off<00:03:16.590> of

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
rather nasty curve in the drop off of

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.490 
rather nasty curve in the drop off of
that<00:03:17.370> waveform<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.930> thought<00:03:19.169> I'd<00:03:19.230> do

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
that waveform so what I thought I'd do

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.720 
that waveform so what I thought I'd do
is<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.829> get<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.099> resistor<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.859> try<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:22.919> use

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
is just get a resistor and try and use

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
is just get a resistor and try and use
that<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.030> pull<00:03:24.690> down<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:27.620> opto<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:30.329> let's<00:03:30.540> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that to pull down the opto so let's have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.159 
that to pull down the opto so let's have
a<00:03:30.840> look<00:03:31.340> yeah<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:32.790> does<00:03:33.150> improve<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
a look yeah so that does improve the

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.039 
a look yeah so that does improve the
full<00:03:34.440> time<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.099> opto<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.329> I'll<00:03:36.480> plug<00:03:36.870> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
full time of the opto so I'll plug that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.589 
full time of the opto so I'll plug that
resistor<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:38.730> they're<00:03:39.090> pulling

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
resistor in so that's they're pulling

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.309 
resistor in so that's they're pulling
the<00:03:39.810> opto<00:03:40.799> down<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.310> ground<00:03:41.579> through<00:03:42.090> 10k<00:03:43.049> that

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the opto down to ground through 10k that

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.500 
the opto down to ground through 10k that
is<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.400> helps<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:46.230> doesn't<00:03:46.560> seem<00:03:46.799> to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
is so that helps it doesn't seem to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.009 
is so that helps it doesn't seem to
massively<00:03:48.510> influence<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:51.510> effect<00:03:51.840> of

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
massively influence the the effect of

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.800 
massively influence the the effect of
the<00:03:52.230> PWM<00:03:52.859> control<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:54.120> looks<00:03:54.329> nicer<00:03:54.569> on<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
the PWM control just looks nicer on the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.939 
the PWM control just looks nicer on the
scope<00:03:55.169> I<00:03:55.349> suppose<00:03:58.879> there<00:03:59.879> is<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.209> delay

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
scope I suppose there is that delay

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.879 
scope I suppose there is that delay
between<00:04:01.949> the<00:04:02.609> fall<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:04.760> PWM<00:04:05.760> signal<00:04:06.030> and

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
between the fall of the PWM signal and

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.729 
between the fall of the PWM signal and
the<00:04:08.389> switching<00:04:09.389> frequency<00:04:09.419> the<00:04:10.260> switching<00:04:10.650> of

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
the switching frequency the switching of

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.509 
the switching frequency the switching of
the<00:04:10.799> switch<00:04:11.609> mode<00:04:11.790> converter<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.810> driver

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
the switch mode converter in this driver

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.219 
the switch mode converter in this driver
actually<00:04:14.519> starting<00:04:15.120> up<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> guess<00:04:15.989> that's

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
actually starting up but I guess that's

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.960 
actually starting up but I guess that's
just<00:04:16.320> inherent<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.130> chip<00:04:17.370> because<00:04:17.849> it

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
just inherent in the chip because it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.479 
just inherent in the chip because it
doesn't<00:04:18.269> seem<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.750> by<00:04:19.409> improving<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.280> shape

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
doesn't seem that by improving the shape

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.839 
doesn't seem that by improving the shape
of<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:20.880> fall<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.740> I've<00:04:22.889> managed<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
of that fall that I've managed to

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.129 
of that fall that I've managed to
influence<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.570> at<00:04:24.900> all<00:04:25.110> really

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
influence that at all really

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.850 
influence that at all really
now<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.159> other<00:04:27.370> thing<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.610> wanted<00:04:27.819> to<00:04:27.879> do<00:04:28.120> was

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
now the other thing I wanted to do was

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.830 
now the other thing I wanted to do was
switch<00:04:29.860> from<00:04:30.249> the<00:04:30.340> 1.2<00:04:30.969> volt<00:04:31.210> battery<00:04:31.569> and<00:04:31.719> go

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
switch from the 1.2 volt battery and go

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260 
switch from the 1.2 volt battery and go
to<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:32.409> 12<00:04:33.009> volt<00:04:33.219> battery<00:04:33.580> pack<00:04:33.759> so<00:04:33.969> here<00:04:34.180> I've

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
to a 12 volt battery pack so here I've

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.969 
to a 12 volt battery pack so here I've
got<00:04:34.479> 10<00:04:35.969> 1.2<00:04:36.969> volt<00:04:37.319> eneloop<00:04:38.319> nickel<00:04:38.860> metal

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
got 10 1.2 volt eneloop nickel metal

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.929 
got 10 1.2 volt eneloop nickel metal
hydrides<00:04:39.550> that's<00:04:40.330> 12<00:04:40.719> volts<00:04:41.199> going<00:04:41.949> into<00:04:42.460> the

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:42.939 
hydrides that's 12 volts going into the

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.140 
hydrides that's 12 volts going into the
opto<00:04:43.629> isolator<00:04:43.659> and<00:04:44.639> the<00:04:45.639> effect<00:04:45.879> of<00:04:45.969> that<00:04:46.029> is

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
opto isolator and the effect of that is

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.619 
opto isolator and the effect of that is
that<00:04:46.629> the<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.879> 490<00:04:48.879> hurts<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.330> course<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.599> a

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
that the the 490 hurts of course is a

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.459 
that the the 490 hurts of course is a
much<00:04:49.840> taller<00:04:50.550> waveform<00:04:51.550> but<00:04:51.729> if<00:04:51.789> i<00:04:51.909> turn<00:04:51.969> the

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
much taller waveform but if i turn the

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.969 
much taller waveform but if i turn the
pwm<00:04:53.469> pot<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.830> can<00:04:53.919> see<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.129> switching<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:55.449> the

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
pwm pot you can see the switching of the

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.959 
pwm pot you can see the switching of the
driver<00:04:56.979> there<00:04:57.279> but<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.520> course<00:04:57.729> it's<00:04:57.789> now

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
driver there but it's course it's now

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.459 
driver there but it's course it's now
dwarfed<00:04:58.509> by<00:04:58.629> the<00:04:58.889> 12<00:04:59.889> volts<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.469> battery

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
dwarfed by the 12 volts of the battery

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.860 
dwarfed by the 12 volts of the battery
on<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.919> opto<00:05:03.370> but<00:05:04.029> it<00:05:04.150> doesn't<00:05:04.539> seem<00:05:04.840> to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
on the opto but it doesn't seem to

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.320 
on the opto but it doesn't seem to
affect<00:05:05.189> linearity<00:05:06.189> that<00:05:06.759> much<00:05:06.969> in<00:05:07.120> fact<00:05:07.240> if

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
affect linearity that much in fact if

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.260 
affect linearity that much in fact if
anything<00:05:07.509> it's<00:05:07.719> made<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.960> slightly<00:05:08.229> worse

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
anything it's made it slightly worse

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:17.159 
anything it's made it slightly worse
that<00:05:12.389> it's<00:05:13.389> very<00:05:13.539> hard<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.870> gauge<00:05:16.110> but<00:05:17.110> it

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
that it's very hard to gauge but it

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.409 
that it's very hard to gauge but it
seems<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.710> reach<00:05:18.419> full<00:05:19.419> brightness<00:05:21.150> some<00:05:22.150> way

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
seems to reach full brightness some way

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.839 
seems to reach full brightness some way
before<00:05:22.839> we<00:05:22.960> hit<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.169> hundred<00:05:23.409> percent<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
before we hit a hundred percent on the

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.589 
before we hit a hundred percent on the
PWM<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:25.689> it<00:05:25.749> now<00:05:25.900> seems<00:05:26.229> that<00:05:26.439> the<00:05:26.529> PWM<00:05:27.189> is<00:05:28.060> kind

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
PWM so it now seems that the PWM is kind

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.300 
PWM so it now seems that the PWM is kind
of<00:05:28.870> from<00:05:29.830> about<00:05:30.009> 10<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:31.050> 90<00:05:32.050> percent<00:05:32.529> another

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
of from about 10 to 90 percent another

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.309 
of from about 10 to 90 percent another
reason<00:05:33.520> I've<00:05:33.580> done<00:05:33.819> this<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.240> because<00:05:34.319> you

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
reason I've done this is because you

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.140 
reason I've done this is because you
don't<00:05:35.439> really<00:05:35.529> want<00:05:35.889> a<00:05:35.979> a<00:05:36.129> battery<00:05:36.639> pack<00:05:36.849> in

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
don't really want a a battery pack in

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.019 
don't really want a a battery pack in
this<00:05:37.539> circuit<00:05:38.169> we<00:05:38.919> want<00:05:39.129> to<00:05:39.279> take<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.520> voltage

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
this circuit we want to take a voltage

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.749 
this circuit we want to take a voltage
that<00:05:40.300> is<00:05:40.509> available<00:05:40.779> and<00:05:41.379> that's<00:05:41.500> here<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.490> 12

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
that is available and that's here the 12

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.290 
that is available and that's here the 12
volts<00:05:43.620> coming<00:05:44.620> in<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:45.639> if<00:05:45.759> I<00:05:45.879> could<00:05:46.060> somehow

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
volts coming in so if I could somehow

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.980 
volts coming in so if I could somehow
route<00:05:46.779> that<00:05:47.259> through<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.189> opto<00:05:48.520> isolator

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
route that through the opto isolator

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.389 
route that through the opto isolator
then<00:05:49.990> course<00:05:50.469> I<00:05:50.589> don't<00:05:50.649> need<00:05:51.009> a<00:05:51.069> pack<00:05:51.250> of

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
then course I don't need a pack of

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.850 
then course I don't need a pack of
batteries<00:05:51.550> which<00:05:51.939> is<00:05:52.089> an<00:05:52.899> inconvenient<00:05:53.710> thing

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
batteries which is an inconvenient thing

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.200 
batteries which is an inconvenient thing
to<00:05:53.979> do<00:05:54.129> so<00:05:54.310> I<00:05:54.339> can<00:05:54.490> have<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.639> look<00:05:54.729> at<00:05:54.879> doing<00:05:55.029> that

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
to do so I can have a look at doing that

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.209 
to do so I can have a look at doing that
now<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:56.699> so<00:05:57.699> finally<00:05:57.939> I've<00:05:58.270> rooted<00:05:58.810> in<00:05:59.770> coming

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
now and so finally I've rooted in coming

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.909 
now and so finally I've rooted in coming
12<00:06:00.580> volts<00:06:01.060> which<00:06:01.210> is<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.509> supply<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:02.800> the

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
12 volts which is the supply to the

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.670 
12 volts which is the supply to the
Sepik<00:06:03.279> converter<00:06:03.699> through<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.539> blue<00:06:05.349> wire

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
Sepik converter through this blue wire

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.499 
Sepik converter through this blue wire
here<00:06:06.189> I'll<00:06:06.759> put<00:06:06.939> it<00:06:07.060> through<00:06:07.210> another

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
here I'll put it through another

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.889 
here I'll put it through another
resistor<00:06:08.259> I<00:06:08.699> just<00:06:09.699> have<00:06:09.789> to<00:06:09.849> find<00:06:10.029> a<00:06:10.180> for<00:06:10.389> k-7

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:10.899 
resistor I just have to find a for k-7

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.839 
resistor I just have to find a for k-7
because<00:06:11.830> there's<00:06:12.009> a<00:06:12.069> lot<00:06:12.219> of<00:06:12.250> current

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
because there's a lot of current

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.589 
because there's a lot of current
potentially<00:06:13.839> available<00:06:14.279> from<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.550> lead<00:06:16.300> acid

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
potentially available from the lead acid

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.409 
potentially available from the lead acid
battery<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:17.529> I<00:06:17.620> just<00:06:17.770> wanted<00:06:18.009> to<00:06:18.360> make<00:06:19.360> sure

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
battery and I just wanted to make sure

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.679 
battery and I just wanted to make sure
that<00:06:19.599> couldn't<00:06:20.139> do<00:06:20.529> any<00:06:20.680> damage<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:22.270> it's<00:06:22.569> had

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:22.689 
that couldn't do any damage and it's had

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.269 
that couldn't do any damage and it's had
a<00:06:22.719> secondary<00:06:23.139> effect<00:06:23.289> actually<00:06:23.649> is<00:06:23.889> it's

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
a secondary effect actually is it's

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.719 
a secondary effect actually is it's
lowered<00:06:24.849> the<00:06:25.120> height<00:06:25.419> of<00:06:25.449> the<00:06:26.550> pulse<00:06:27.550> width

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
lowered the height of the pulse width

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.990 
lowered the height of the pulse width
modulation<00:06:28.210> waveform<00:06:29.139> that's<00:06:29.889> around<00:06:30.550> four

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
volts now 2 volts per division there at

the<00:06:34.149> bottom<00:06:34.300> channel<00:06:34.839> 1<00:06:35.050> so<00:06:36.009> it's<00:06:36.250> slightly

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
the bottom channel 1 so it's slightly

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.450 
the bottom channel 1 so it's slightly
lowered<00:06:37.539> that

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
lowered that

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.290 
lowered that
but<00:06:38.850> that<00:06:39.780> I<00:06:39.990> suppose<00:06:40.440> is<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:41.550> end<00:06:41.729> of<00:06:42.000> this

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
but that I suppose is the end of this

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.950 
but that I suppose is the end of this
little<00:06:43.110> test<00:06:43.380> we<00:06:44.160> now<00:06:44.370> have<00:06:44.759> pulse<00:06:45.720> width

occur over a hundred percent of the
waveform<00:07:06.389> so<00:07:07.139> we<00:07:07.289> have<00:07:07.440> full<00:07:07.770> brightness

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
waveform so we have full brightness

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.390 
waveform so we have full brightness
control<00:07:09.150> you<00:07:09.750> need<00:07:09.930> to<00:07:10.139> limit<00:07:10.500> the<00:07:10.919> range<00:07:11.160> of

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
control you need to limit the range of

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.600 
control you need to limit the range of
PWM<00:07:12.120> that<00:07:12.330> you're<00:07:12.449> putting<00:07:12.780> in<00:07:12.990> but<00:07:13.770> I<00:07:14.370> think

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
PWM that you're putting in but I think

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.120 
PWM that you're putting in but I think
that's<00:07:14.880> reasonably<00:07:15.750> successful<00:07:16.130> linearity

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
that's reasonably successful linearity

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.070 
that's reasonably successful linearity
is<00:07:17.520> a<00:07:17.550> bit<00:07:17.940> suspect<00:07:18.360> but<00:07:18.979> it's<00:07:19.979> not<00:07:20.190> too<00:07:20.400> bad

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
is a bit suspect but it's not too bad

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.939 
is a bit suspect but it's not too bad
and<00:07:23.300> so<00:07:24.300> to<00:07:24.360> sum<00:07:24.780> up<00:07:24.860> this<00:07:25.860> very<00:07:26.669> handy<00:07:27.030> little
