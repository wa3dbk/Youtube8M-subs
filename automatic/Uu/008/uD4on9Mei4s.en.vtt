00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
happened today I've got a big package

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.010 
happened today I've got a big package
medium<00:00:14.670> sized<00:00:14.790> package<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.420> makers<00:00:15.839> Tool

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
medium sized package from makers Tool

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.140 
medium sized package from makers Tool
Works<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.400> half<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.880> my

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
Works with the first half of my

Works with the first half of my
mendelmax<00:00:18.630> 2<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> I've<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> 3d<00:00:21.060> printer

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
mendelmax 2 in it I've had a 3d printer

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
mendelmax 2 in it I've had a 3d printer
here<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.869> while<00:00:22.080> well<00:00:22.800> it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
here for a little while well it's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.689 
here for a little while well it's
actually<00:00:23.310> marks<00:00:24.240> 3d<00:00:24.900> printer<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:26.279> over<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
actually marks 3d printer just over here

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
actually marks 3d printer just over here
it's<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> original<00:00:28.279> MakerBot

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it's one of the original MakerBot

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.440 
it's one of the original MakerBot
cupcakes<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.579> tricked<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.239> with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
cupcakes and it's all tricked out with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.970 
cupcakes and it's all tricked out with
LEDs<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> stuff<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> lights<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
LEDs and stuff so it lights up like a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
LEDs and stuff so it lights up like a
Christmas<00:00:35.070> tree<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.230> 3d<00:00:37.230> printing<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
Christmas tree and 3d printing is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
Christmas tree and 3d printing is
awesome<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.090> limited<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
awesome but it's a bit limited with the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
awesome but it's a bit limited with the
cupcake<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.590> few<00:00:40.770> years<00:00:40.950> old<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.280> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
cupcake that's a few years old now in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.770 
cupcake that's a few years old now in
fact<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.270> cupcakes

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
fact this is one of the first cupcakes

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.670 
fact this is one of the first cupcakes
that<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.050> ever<00:00:43.200> built

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that was ever built

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
that was ever built
it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.300> first

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it was from one of the very first

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.340 
it was from one of the very first
batches<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.850> old<00:00:48.350> printhead

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
batches so it's got the old printhead

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.459 
batches so it's got the old printhead
that<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:50.010> should<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> museum<00:00:50.760> it's

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
that really should be in a museum it's

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.360 
that really should be in a museum it's
quite<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> museum<00:00:52.890> piece

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
quite a museum piece

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
quite a museum piece
in<00:00:53.760> fact<00:00:53.940> mark<00:00:54.300> doesn't<00:00:54.570> want<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.780> modified

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
in fact mark doesn't want it modified

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.760 
in fact mark doesn't want it modified
because<00:00:55.379> he<00:00:55.890> wants<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> keep<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
because he wants to keep it as a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.310 
because he wants to keep it as a
representative<00:00:58.789> thing<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.960> 3d<00:01:01.199> printing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
representative thing of what 3d printing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.369 
representative thing of what 3d printing
was<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> early<00:01:02.520> days<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:04.170> over

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
was like in the early days and just over

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.899 
was like in the early days and just over
here<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.739> bench<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.229> box<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.070> was

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
here on my bench I have a box that was

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.789 
here on my bench I have a box that was
delivered<00:01:09.330> today<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> let's<00:01:11.790> cut<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.360> open

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
delivered today so let's cut this open

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.679 
delivered today so let's cut this open
its<00:01:13.799> limitations<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:14.970> MakerBot<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
its limitations of that MakerBot the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.789 
its limitations of that MakerBot the
their<00:01:16.500> prints<00:01:16.799> quite<00:01:17.040> slowly<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.799> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
their prints quite slowly and the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.760 
their prints quite slowly and the
resolution<00:01:20.310> isn't<00:01:20.460> too<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
resolution isn't too good and also the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
resolution isn't too good and also the
build<00:01:23.009> area<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.880> good<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.680> you're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
build area in that good so if you're

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
build area in that good so if you're
doing<00:01:26.810> prototyping<00:01:27.810> before<00:01:28.700> stuff<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
doing prototyping before stuff one of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
doing prototyping before stuff one of
the<00:01:30.479> things<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.840> want<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the things that we want to do is that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.569 
the things that we want to do is that
Freck<00:01:32.610> tronic<00:01:32.880> something<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:34.220> produce<00:01:35.220> some

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
Freck tronic something is produce some

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.200 
Freck tronic something is produce some
cases<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:37.070> Arduino<00:01:38.070> related<00:01:38.579> things<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
cases for Arduino related things and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.100 
cases for Arduino related things and
we've<00:01:40.140> already<00:01:40.290> done

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
we've already done

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
we've already done
injection<00:01:43.110> molding<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.939> customers<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.149> a

injection molding for customers for a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.870 
injection molding for customers for a
number<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> commercial<00:01:45.720> customers<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.530> for

number of commercial customers not for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.069 
number of commercial customers not for
open-source<00:01:47.880> things<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.700> we've<00:01:50.700> used

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
open-source things and we've used

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.980 
open-source things and we've used
commercial<00:01:52.079> 3d<00:01:52.229> printing<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.360> prototyping

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
commercial 3d printing to do prototyping

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.620 
commercial 3d printing to do prototyping
on<00:01:55.409> those<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> MakerBot<00:01:57.479> just

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
on those but because the MakerBot just

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.319 
on those but because the MakerBot just
is<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:59.280> should<00:01:59.340> let<00:02:00.030> us<00:02:00.090> do

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
is not to it and they should let us do

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
is not to it and they should let us do
some<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.689> interesting<00:02:01.219> prototypes<00:02:02.219> oh<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
some more interesting prototypes oh I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.870 
some more interesting prototypes oh I
see<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.729> we've<00:02:02.820> got<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.060> here

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
see what we've got in here

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
see what we've got in here
there's<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:05.970> very<00:02:06.150> well<00:02:06.299> packed<00:02:06.510> I've<00:02:06.690> got<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
there's all very well packed I've got to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.350 
there's all very well packed I've got to
say<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.110> arrived<00:02:07.380> extremely<00:02:07.890> fast<00:02:08.179> only<00:02:09.179> took

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
say it arrived extremely fast only took

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
say it arrived extremely fast only took
a<00:02:09.420> few<00:02:09.600> days<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:10.080> from<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> u.s.<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a few days to get from the u.s. to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.610 
a few days to get from the u.s. to
Australia<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.200> pity<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.410> would

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
Australia it's just a pity that would

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
Australia it's just a pity that would
Township<00:02:13.980> things<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.490> quickly<00:02:14.670> back<00:02:15.000> well

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
Township things that quickly back well

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.090 
Township things that quickly back well

this box looks like it's got a whole
bunch<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.910> random<00:02:18.569> bits<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.959> hardware<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
bunch of random bits of hardware in it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.090 
bunch of random bits of hardware in it
we've<00:02:22.410> got<00:02:23.540> there's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.600> cooling<00:02:25.080> fan<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.680> little

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
we've got there's a cooling fan a little

wiring<00:02:26.640> loom<00:02:26.819> looks<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.530> heating<00:02:28.530> element

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
wiring loom looks like a heating element

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.949 
wiring loom looks like a heating element
or<00:02:28.950> something<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.340> there<00:02:29.550> there's<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.450> bracket

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
or something in there there's a bracket

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.759 
or something in there there's a bracket
and<00:02:34.069> this<00:02:35.069> one<00:02:35.569> feels<00:02:36.569> very<00:02:36.690> heavy<00:02:37.080> ah<00:02:37.260> that's

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
and this one feels very heavy ah that's

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.770 
and this one feels very heavy ah that's
because<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.190> got<00:02:38.400> stepper<00:02:39.150> motors<00:02:39.540> no<00:02:39.750> I

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
because it's got stepper motors no I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.890 
because it's got stepper motors no I
think<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> stepper<00:02:43.920> motor<00:02:44.600> let's<00:02:45.600> have

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
think this is a stepper motor let's have

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.190 
think this is a stepper motor let's have
a<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:50.300> should<00:02:51.300> attach<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.720> camera<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
a look I should attach the camera to the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.780 
a look I should attach the camera to the
tripod<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.800> doing<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:53.310> hard<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.640> do

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
tripod for doing this it's hard to do

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
tripod for doing this it's hard to do
this<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:55.050> race<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.440> open<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> box<00:02:55.890> all

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
this and the race and open the box all

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.390 
this and the race and open the box all
at<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> same<00:02:56.459> time<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.739> hand

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.440 

yep<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.819> looks<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.980> very<00:03:04.980> solid<00:03:05.850> stepper

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
yep that looks like a very solid stepper

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.690 
yep that looks like a very solid stepper
motor<00:03:07.130> put<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.250> aside<00:03:10.070> nothing<00:03:11.070> here<00:03:11.250> USB

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
motor put that aside nothing here USB

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.610 
motor put that aside nothing here USB
cable<00:03:12.060> I've<00:03:12.780> only<00:03:12.900> got<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> few<00:03:13.260> thousand<00:03:13.590> of

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
cable I've only got a few thousand of

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.440 
cable I've only got a few thousand of
those<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:17.160> more<00:03:17.400> random<00:03:17.640> bits<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
those it's more random bits of the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.319 
those it's more random bits of the
wiring<00:03:18.870> loom<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:20.670> fairly<00:03:20.850> heavy<00:03:21.060> gauge<00:03:21.299> wire

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
wiring loom it's fairly heavy gauge wire

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.720 
wiring loom it's fairly heavy gauge wire
so<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> assume<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.380> must<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.799> do<00:03:22.890> with<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
so I assume it must be to do with the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.370 
so I assume it must be to do with the
power<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.269> dippers<00:03:24.840> or<00:03:24.989> maybe<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
power to this dippers or maybe the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.670 
power to this dippers or maybe the
heating<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> strange<00:03:27.959> looking<00:03:28.230> cable

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
heating this is a strange looking cable

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.780 
heating this is a strange looking cable
it's<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.070> USB<00:03:29.370> cable<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:31.560> got<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> mount<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:32.670> it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it's a USB cable it's got a mount on it

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
it's a USB cable it's got a mount on it
so<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.209> can<00:03:33.360> fit<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> bracket

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
so that you can fit it to a bracket

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.380 
so that you can fit it to a bracket
picked<00:03:35.070> up<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.459> probably<00:03:35.790> fits<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.299> of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
picked up that probably fits to one of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.240 
picked up that probably fits to one of
those<00:03:36.480> other<00:03:36.660> brackets<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.110> saw<00:03:37.260> earlier<00:03:37.560> it's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
those other brackets we saw earlier it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.449 
those other brackets we saw earlier it's
got<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> USB<00:03:39.170> socket<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.860> end<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.220> plug

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
got a USB socket on one end and a plug

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.569 
got a USB socket on one end and a plug
on<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.700> other<00:03:42.680> now<00:03:43.680> there<00:03:44.400> were<00:03:44.459> some

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
on the other now there were some

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.720 
on the other now there were some
different<00:03:44.910> options<00:03:45.239> for<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.510> controller<00:03:45.959> and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
different options for the controller and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.009 
different options for the controller and
it<00:03:47.730> could<00:03:47.880> have<00:03:47.970> either<00:03:48.060> been<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.299> ramps<00:03:48.720> board

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
it could have either been a ramps board

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.349 
it could have either been a ramps board
or<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.799> could<00:03:49.920> have<00:03:50.010> been<00:03:50.130> what<00:03:50.340> they<00:03:51.000> called

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
or it could have been what they called

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.060 
or it could have been what they called
the<00:03:51.450> rambo<00:03:51.900> now<00:03:52.200> ramps<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:52.859> I'm<00:03:52.950> familiar

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
the rambo now ramps is what I'm familiar

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.349 
the rambo now ramps is what I'm familiar
with<00:03:53.340> from<00:03:54.049> RepRap<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.910> related<00:03:56.910> projects

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
with from RepRap and related projects

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.979 
with from RepRap and related projects
I've<00:03:58.019> never<00:03:58.320> even<00:03:58.440> heard<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.160> rambo<00:04:00.030> until<00:04:00.660> I

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
I've never even heard of rambo until I

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.640 
I've never even heard of rambo until I
saw<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.890> order<00:04:02.250> form<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.790> mendelmax<00:04:03.090> so

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
saw the order form for the mendelmax so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.099 
saw the order form for the mendelmax so
I've<00:04:04.650> got<00:04:05.310> no<00:04:05.459> idea<00:04:05.489> what<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.630> difference<00:04:06.930> is

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
I've got no idea what the difference is

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.610 
I've got no idea what the difference is
and<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.310> work<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:09.000> was<00:04:09.120> recommended<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and this work it was recommended on the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.770 
and this work it was recommended on the
order<00:04:11.100> form<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.609> go<00:04:11.850> for<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> rambo<00:04:12.450> rather

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
order form to go for the rambo rather

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.129 
order form to go for the rambo rather
than<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:14.120> ramps<00:04:15.120> board<00:04:15.389> so<00:04:15.630> that's<00:04:15.959> what<00:04:16.079> I

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
than the ramps board so that's what I

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:16.870 
than the ramps board so that's what I
did

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
did

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.630 
did
a<00:04:17.290> whole<00:04:18.290> bunch<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.620> connectors<00:04:19.130> there<00:04:19.340> for

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
a whole bunch of connectors there for

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.540 
a whole bunch of connectors there for
the<00:04:19.790> wiring<00:04:20.060> loom<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.890> looks<00:04:25.190> like<00:04:25.370> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
the wiring loom and that looks like the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.200 
the wiring loom and that looks like the
board<00:04:25.790> itself<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:30.670> don't<00:04:31.670> think<00:04:31.790> I<00:04:31.880> can<00:04:32.060> open

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
board itself so don't think I can open

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.800 
board itself so don't think I can open
that<00:04:32.450> with<00:04:32.630> one<00:04:32.780> hand<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:35.240> know<00:04:35.300> I'll<00:04:35.570> give<00:04:35.720> it

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
that with one hand you know I'll give it

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.210 
that with one hand you know I'll give it
a<00:04:35.870> try<00:04:38.110> if<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.230> can<00:04:39.260> Nick<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.740> should<00:04:39.920> be<00:04:40.010> right

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
a try if I can Nick it I should be right

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.010 
a try if I can Nick it I should be right
hopefully<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.120> won't<00:04:41.270> make<00:04:41.450> myself<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
hopefully I won't make myself in the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:53.020 
hopefully I won't make myself in the
process<00:04:49.600> okay<00:04:50.600> so<00:04:50.930> no<00:04:51.460> workplace<00:04:52.460> accident

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
process okay so no workplace accident

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:15.910 
process okay so no workplace accident
there<00:04:53.240> today<00:05:10.810> there<00:05:11.810> we<00:05:11.900> go<00:05:14.350> no<00:05:15.350> that's

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
there today there we go no that's

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.480 
there today there we go no that's
interesting

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
interesting

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.250 
interesting
it's<00:05:17.300> interesting<00:05:17.480> looking<00:05:17.780> forward<00:05:18.080> looks

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
it's interesting looking forward looks

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.100 
it's interesting looking forward looks
like<00:05:18.710> it's<00:05:18.860> got<00:05:19.010> everything<00:05:19.310> integrated<00:05:21.490> the

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
like it's got everything integrated the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.620 
like it's got everything integrated the
many<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.320> RepRap<00:05:24.910> type<00:05:25.910> models<00:05:26.300> of<00:05:26.420> course

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
many of the RepRap type models of course

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.330 
many of the RepRap type models of course
you<00:05:26.870> something<00:05:27.260> like<00:05:27.380> an<00:05:27.530> Arduino<00:05:27.920> board<00:05:27.950> with

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
you something like an Arduino board with

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.460 
you something like an Arduino board with
a<00:05:28.370> shield<00:05:28.670> on<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.180> this<00:05:30.050> seems<00:05:30.290> to<00:05:30.380> be

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
a shield on it and this seems to be

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.380 
a shield on it and this seems to be
everything<00:05:30.920> integrated<00:05:31.370> all<00:05:31.580> into<00:05:31.820> one<00:05:31.970> which

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
everything integrated all into one which

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.690 
everything integrated all into one which
is<00:05:32.510> quite<00:05:32.720> nice<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.350> got

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
is quite nice so it's got

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.430 
is quite nice so it's got
microcontroller<00:05:34.700> on<00:05:34.790> there<00:05:35.140> let's<00:05:36.140> see<00:05:36.260> if<00:05:36.380> I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
microcontroller on there let's see if I

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.770 
microcontroller on there let's see if I
can<00:05:36.590> see<00:05:36.770> what<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.130> is<00:05:38.170> it's<00:05:39.170> an<00:05:39.260> 80<00:05:39.380> mega<00:05:40.780> 1280

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
can see what it is it's an 80 mega 1280

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.390 
can see what it is it's an 80 mega 1280
I<00:05:41.930> think<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:46.700> whole<00:05:47.630> bunch<00:05:47.660> of<00:05:47.900> connectors

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
I think and a whole bunch of connectors

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.470 
I think and a whole bunch of connectors
so<00:05:49.400> I'll<00:05:49.640> have<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.760> look<00:05:49.880> at<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.090> board<00:05:50.300> in<00:05:50.420> a

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
so I'll have a look at that board in a

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.230 
so I'll have a look at that board in a
bit<00:05:50.600> more<00:05:50.690> detail<00:05:51.610> later<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.760> when<00:05:53.030> I'm<00:05:53.120> not

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
bit more detail later on when I'm not

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.520 
bit more detail later on when I'm not
trying<00:05:53.480> to<00:05:53.540> hold<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.810> camera<00:05:54.110> at<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.350> same

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
trying to hold the camera at the same

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.120 
trying to hold the camera at the same
time<00:05:55.420> so<00:05:56.420> then<00:05:56.780> oh<00:05:57.050> this<00:05:57.470> is<00:05:57.560> a<00:05:57.620> heavy<00:05:57.770> part<00:05:58.040> of

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
time so then oh this is a heavy part of

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.730 
time so then oh this is a heavy part of
the<00:05:58.190> package<00:05:58.990> it's<00:05:59.990> another<00:06:00.170> whole<00:06:00.350> bunch<00:06:00.620> of

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
the package it's another whole bunch of

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.090 
the package it's another whole bunch of
stepper<00:06:01.010> motors<00:06:02.080> let<00:06:03.080> me<00:06:03.170> take<00:06:03.350> four<00:06:03.680> step<00:06:03.980> is

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
stepper motors let me take four step is

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.310 
stepper motors let me take four step is
in<00:06:04.250> there<00:06:06.310> down<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> bottom<00:06:07.730> a<00:06:08.150> box<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.110> says

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
in there down the bottom a box that says

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.010 
in there down the bottom a box that says
switching<00:06:09.680> power<00:06:09.830> supply<00:06:10.450> okay<00:06:11.450> so<00:06:11.630> it's<00:06:11.900> just

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
switching power supply okay so it's just

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.500 
switching power supply okay so it's just
like<00:06:12.110> a<00:06:12.140> low-profile<00:06:12.970> computer<00:06:13.970> power<00:06:14.120> supply

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
like a low-profile computer power supply

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.940 
like a low-profile computer power supply
you<00:06:14.780> know<00:06:14.870> like<00:06:15.050> what<00:06:15.200> you'd<00:06:15.290> find<00:06:15.500> in<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:15.740> rack

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
you know like what you'd find in a rack

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.680 
you know like what you'd find in a rack
mount<00:06:16.280> servic<00:06:16.880> ace<00:06:17.410> by<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.470> looks<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:19.690> okay

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
mount servic ace by the looks of it okay

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.490 
mount servic ace by the looks of it okay
so<00:06:20.990> that's<00:06:21.080> pretty<00:06:21.320> standard<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:23.350> that's<00:06:24.350> all

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
so that's pretty standard and that's all

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.480 
so that's pretty standard and that's all
there<00:06:24.650> is<00:06:24.680> in<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:24.950> electronics<00:06:25.370> package<00:06:27.490> well

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
there is in the electronics package well

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.209 
there is in the electronics package well
there<00:06:28.610> are<00:06:28.700> some<00:06:28.760> fun<00:06:28.940> toys<00:06:29.180> in<00:06:29.360> there

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
there are some fun toys in there

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.949 
there are some fun toys in there
so<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.849> other<00:06:30.969> package<00:06:31.300> that<00:06:31.479> I'm<00:06:31.569> waiting<00:06:31.869> on

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:31.959 
so the other package that I'm waiting on

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.409 
so the other package that I'm waiting on
is<00:06:32.199> the<00:06:32.679> physical<00:06:33.159> chassis<00:06:33.610> that's<00:06:34.179> going<00:06:34.360> to

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
is the physical chassis that's going to

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:35.999 
is the physical chassis that's going to
be<00:06:34.479> probably<00:06:34.689> a<00:06:34.929> bit<00:06:35.110> larger<00:06:35.499> it'll<00:06:35.770> have<00:06:35.889> the

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
be probably a bit larger it'll have the

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.279 
be probably a bit larger it'll have the
glass<00:06:36.219> plate<00:06:36.639> in<00:06:36.819> them<00:06:36.939> from<00:06:37.839> what<00:06:37.959> I<00:06:37.989> heard

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
glass plate in them from what I heard

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.629 
glass plate in them from what I heard
there<00:06:38.949> were<00:06:39.039> some<00:06:39.189> problems<00:06:39.339> with

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
there were some problems with

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.820 
there were some problems with
manufacturing<00:06:40.389> of<00:06:40.569> the<00:06:40.719> original<00:06:41.469> batch<00:06:41.649> of

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
manufacturing of the original batch of

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.309 
manufacturing of the original batch of
glass<00:06:42.069> plates<00:06:42.459> so<00:06:43.149> they<00:06:43.389> got<00:06:43.569> held<00:06:43.779> over<00:06:44.110> and

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
glass plates so they got held over and

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.529 
glass plates so they got held over and
what<00:06:44.499> they<00:06:44.800> did<00:06:45.099> was<00:06:45.249> ship<00:06:45.489> the<00:06:45.939> electronics

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
what they did was ship the electronics

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.540 
what they did was ship the electronics
first<00:06:46.809> and<00:06:47.050> then<00:06:47.619> they're<00:06:47.769> going<00:06:47.889> to<00:06:48.009> ship<00:06:48.249> the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
first and then they're going to ship the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.600 
first and then they're going to ship the
chassis<00:06:49.330> and<00:06:49.599> the<00:06:49.749> glass<00:06:49.929> plate<00:06:50.259> later<00:06:50.499> so<00:06:51.309> I

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
chassis and the glass plate later so I

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.919 
chassis and the glass plate later so I
might<00:06:51.819> give<00:06:52.149> you<00:06:52.179> a<00:06:52.269> look<00:06:52.389> at<00:06:52.479> that<00:06:52.599> and<00:06:52.869> I'll

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:52.929 
might give you a look at that and I'll
