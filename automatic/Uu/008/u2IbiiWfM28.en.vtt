00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
off to Celtic in the summer but another

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.080 
off to Celtic in the summer but another

Martin again another captain's perform

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.069 
Martin again another captain's perform
was<00:04:10.220> John<00:04:10.459> Ruddy<00:04:10.699> his<00:04:11.150> best<00:04:11.449> gaming<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.840> long

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
was John Ruddy his best gaming a long

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.559 
was John Ruddy his best gaming a long
while<00:04:12.319> pulling<00:04:12.769> off<00:04:12.889> a<00:04:13.069> few<00:04:13.459> really<00:04:13.849> crucial

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
while pulling off a few really crucial

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.339 
while pulling off a few really crucial
saves<00:04:15.079> but<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.370> still<00:04:17.299> looks<00:04:17.630> unlikely<00:04:18.079> that

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
saves but it still looks unlikely that

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.650 
saves but it still looks unlikely that
we're<00:04:18.470> gonna<00:04:18.620> stay<00:04:18.859> up<00:04:18.889> this<00:04:19.160> season<00:04:19.430> now<00:04:19.849> but

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
we've given ourselves a chance that's

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.860 
we've given ourselves a chance that's
all<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:22.430> could<00:04:22.610> do<00:04:22.789> today<00:04:23.090> are<00:04:23.330> very<00:04:23.539> proud<00:04:23.810> of
