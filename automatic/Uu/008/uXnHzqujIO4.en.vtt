00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
all season I think the key in terms of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
all season I think the key in terms of
what<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.630> trying<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.369> revolves

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
what we're trying to do is revolves

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
what we're trying to do is revolves
around<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> run<00:00:29.760> game<00:00:29.939> both<00:00:30.240> our<00:00:30.480> ability<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
around the run game both our ability to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500 
around the run game both our ability to
run<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> football<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> control<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> game

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
with that and our ability to stop their

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.990 
with that and our ability to stop their
run<00:00:37.050> game<00:00:37.079> their<00:00:37.440> formidable<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.850> they

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
run game their formidable in what they

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
run game their formidable in what they
do<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> we've<00:00:40.469> got<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.800> able<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.219> line

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
do and and we've got to be able to line

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
do and and we've got to be able to line
up<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.670> them<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.910> stop<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
up with them and stop them at that you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
up with them and stop them at that you
know<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.340> best<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
know what they do best so I think the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
know what they do best so I think the
keys<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> revolve<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.039> around

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
keys kind of revolve around that around

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.000 
keys kind of revolve around that around
those<00:00:47.640> elements

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.160 

we<00:00:55.010> will<00:00:55.190> be<00:00:55.280> looking<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.640> stop<00:00:55.880> or<00:00:56.210> their

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
we will be looking to stop or their

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.530 
we will be looking to stop or their
traps<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.890> their<00:00:58.040> counters<00:00:58.460> they're<00:00:58.730> very

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
traps and their counters they're very

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.900 
traps and their counters they're very
effective<00:01:00.050> at<00:01:00.260> getting<00:01:00.710> off<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> ball

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
effective at getting off the ball

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.270 
effective at getting off the ball
quickly<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.570> being<00:01:03.110> able<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.470> get<00:01:03.980> up<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.190> the

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
quickly and being able to get up to the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.740 
quickly and being able to get up to the
second<00:01:04.610> level<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:04.970> we<00:01:05.059> got<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.270> make<00:01:05.360> sure<00:01:05.420> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
second level so we got to make sure that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.890 
second level so we got to make sure that
we<00:01:06.530> read<00:01:06.740> our<00:01:06.890> keys<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.510> stay<00:01:08.510> on<00:01:08.630> our<00:01:08.720> guys

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
we read our keys and stay on our guys

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.840 
we read our keys and stay on our guys
and<00:01:08.960> cover<00:01:09.710> our<00:01:09.770> gaps<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:10.370> can't<00:01:10.580> let<00:01:10.700> them

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and cover our gaps we can't let them

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.760 
and cover our gaps we can't let them
know<00:01:11.150> creases<00:01:11.570> there<00:01:11.870> can<00:01:11.960> be<00:01:11.990> no<00:01:12.230> creases<00:01:12.650> in

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
know creases there can be no creases in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.440 
know creases there can be no creases in
this<00:01:12.890> game<00:01:13.100> because<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:14.000> have<00:01:14.120> running

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
this game because they have running

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.480 
this game because they have running
backs<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.170> take<00:01:15.350> over<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.890> find

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
backs that can just take over and find

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.010 
backs that can just take over and find
the<00:01:16.610> creases<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.060> run<00:01:17.360> through<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.870> plow

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
the creases and run through and plow

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.530 
the creases and run through and plow
through<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.620> know<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.220> linebackers<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.030> you

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
through you know the linebackers so you

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.670 
through you know the linebackers so you
got<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.720> make<00:01:20.810> sure<00:01:20.870> you<00:01:21.050> clog<00:01:21.320> your<00:01:21.350> holes
