maybe you know they must have seen them
too<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> mean<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.579> looks<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
too I mean this looks like it so it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
too I mean this looks like it so it
could<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.350> successful<00:00:34.440> enemy<00:00:35.070> they

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
could be a really successful enemy they

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.959 
could be a really successful enemy they
don't<00:00:36.559> very<00:00:37.559> sad

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
don't very sad

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.780 
don't very sad
apparently<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.530> oh<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.430> were<00:00:41.550> low

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
apparently it's oh there were low

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.650 
apparently it's oh there were low
ratings<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> Japan<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:45.210> acts<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
ratings in Japan so they were acts I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
ratings in Japan so they were acts I
think<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:45.930> were<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.289> planning<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
think they were actually planning on to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
think they were actually planning on to
do<00:00:47.550> season<00:00:47.969> arms<00:00:48.239> into<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:49.140> since<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
do season arms into but since the

ratings got even lower or whatever they

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
ratings got even lower or whatever they
