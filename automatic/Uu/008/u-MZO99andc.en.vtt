00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have to open it and with this one we

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.679 
have to open it and with this one we

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it's not right to unwrap it we can't go

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.109 
it's not right to unwrap it we can't go
that<00:01:53.970> far<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.930> long<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.560> like

reason<00:01:58.500> why<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> restrict<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
reason why we have to restrict it to the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.260 
reason why we have to restrict it to the
US<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> subscriber

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

to the YouTube channel and once we hit

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.749 
to the YouTube channel and once we hit
3000<00:02:05.280> will<00:02:05.820> randomize<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> numbers<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.759> add

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
3000 will randomize the numbers and add

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.100 
3000 will randomize the numbers and add
that<00:02:09.030> only<00:02:09.179> that'll<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.840> goes

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that only that'll be the way it goes

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
that only that'll be the way it goes
well<00:02:10.560> randomize<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> number<00:02:11.459> numbers<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
well randomize the number numbers and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
well randomize the number numbers and
then<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.930> say<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.410> video

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
then what do you say we do a video

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250
