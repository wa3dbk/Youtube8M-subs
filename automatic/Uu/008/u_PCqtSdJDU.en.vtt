00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.459
 searched on the one hand if cameron witch 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.769
 witch 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.900
 or the witch what's up with your roll of 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.459
 To know you, how are you looking at everything? 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.709
 the world tells me that I am tall maybe 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.569
 a program or what was missing does not matter 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.099
 Nobody cares that you're high low 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.489
 tell him what he has to do now 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.590
 cameron well can you can move 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.239
 blocks really clear that I can move 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.010
 blocks and tell him well because 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.110
 we need to build a bridge to what 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.299
 long of this pit I like how it sounds 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.099
 yes, the one that we love as it is a 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.750
 iso will sound good if you shut up 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.510
 time and you get to work well 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.629
 We will enter deeply I bet that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.629
 civilians that is deep deep too 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.629
 God 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.730
 where is marcus marcos as more like 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.730
 how with these in that hole simplified 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 what does that mean 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 [Music] 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.900
 how do you plan to get out of there 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.760
 or 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.450
 and another one here already finished guys what 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.549
 is that a bridge like that is called a bridge 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.790
 but like fuck I think we're going to cross 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.239
 that cameron then you put here you take 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.239
 up to this point 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.680
 Cameron that formula does not work for 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.269
 we believe that you are asked 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.069
 what kind of bridge did you want and I think 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.629
 remember also what you said cameron 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.000
 makes the bridge that was what was missing 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.069
 before you will explain it is not my fault in 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.109
 Well, well, forgive me for leaving you 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.909
 do to your liking the damn bridge that 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.400
 you know that I have put all my effort 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.379
 love and my soul in this well this is what 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.430
 What do I need? I need a straight bridge 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.690
 from here the point a to point b 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.210
 have you heard 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 point b not point b I imagine because 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.820
 to me the point that you can also 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.820
 work 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.980
 [Music] 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:34.129

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:34.129
