00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
show you three simple piston inventions

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
show you three simple piston inventions
the<00:00:20.670> probe<00:00:20.880> were<00:00:21.090> already<00:00:21.240> been<00:00:21.480> invented<00:00:21.810> but

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the probe were already been invented but

made up kinda by myself so yeah this one
first<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:32.059> piston<00:00:33.059> door<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:35.030> say<00:00:36.030> yeah

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
first one is a piston door I say yeah

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.280 
first one is a piston door I say yeah
two<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.370> opens<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> closes<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.540> go<00:00:40.140> to

two and just opens and closes and go to
the<00:00:40.379> other<00:00:40.410> side<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:43.290> either

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
side I'll show you the guts of this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.690 
side I'll show you the guts of this
thing<00:00:48.320> are<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.500> near<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> redstone<00:00:50.309> repeater

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
thing are you near the redstone repeater

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060 
thing are you near the redstone repeater
that<00:00:51.149> controls<00:00:51.570> both<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that controls both of them then you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000 
that controls both of them then you
won't<00:00:53.250> invert<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
won't invert it so it's on and then you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580 
won't invert it so it's on and then you
put<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.280> saw<00:00:56.430> flying<00:00:56.640> wire<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
put your saw flying wire here this is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.520 
put your saw flying wire here this is
the<00:00:58.969> white<00:00:59.969> line<00:01:00.329> 21<00:01:00.780> other<00:01:00.930> sides<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the white line 21 other sides of the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
the white line 21 other sides of the
buttons<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> goes<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
buttons this goes up here that's the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
buttons this goes up here that's the
line<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> other<00:01:04.559> button<00:01:05.090> then<00:01:06.090> it's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
line for the other button then it's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.820 
line for the other button then it's
practically<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> same<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> other<00:01:07.409> side

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.070 

inverter<00:01:10.830> again<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.000> yeah<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.510> trolls<00:01:12.840> very

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
inverter again and yeah like trolls very

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
button house and turns in dryer off

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.960 
button house and turns in dryer off
turning<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> Pistons<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.200> go

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
turning off the Pistons which make it go

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.390 
turning off the Pistons which make it go
inside<00:01:22.100> pretty<00:01:23.100> simple<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> yeah<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.220> the

inside pretty simple so yeah that's the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
inside pretty simple so yeah that's the
piston<00:01:26.700> door<00:01:27.020> next<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:30.049> these

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
piston door next one I have is these

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.310 
piston door next one I have is these
stairs<00:01:31.590> um<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.869> use<00:01:34.049> either<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:35.270> hiding

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
stairs um you can use either for hiding

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
they found the switch now you can go up

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140 
they found the switch now you can go up
and<00:02:01.850> yeah<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
and yeah that's a

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.300 
and yeah that's a
simple<00:02:04.990> let's<00:02:05.380> have<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> look<00:02:05.680> at<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.920> guts<00:02:06.130> of

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
simple let's have a look at the guts of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.139 
simple let's have a look at the guts of
this<00:02:06.460> one<00:02:08.009> all<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.160> need<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.940> put

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
this one all you need to do is just put

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.630 
this one all you need to do is just put
redstone<00:02:10.330> repeaters<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.230> then<00:02:12.100> there's<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
redstone repeaters and then there's the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.120 
redstone repeaters and then there's the
red<00:02:12.880> stone<00:02:13.120> behind<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.260> that's<00:02:14.620> really

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
red stone behind it and that's really

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.740 
red stone behind it and that's really
the<00:02:15.460> compact<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:17.730> most<00:02:18.730> compact<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.450> get

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the compact is most compact you can get

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.610 
the compact is most compact you can get
with<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.960> good<00:02:23.910> until<00:02:24.910> their

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
with this which is good until their
