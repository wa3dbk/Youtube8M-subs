two to dry for blow or one for blow back
to<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.150> draw<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.709> got<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:21.760> then<00:03:22.760> back<00:03:22.909> to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
to to draw so we got it and then back to

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
twice and then you kind of do a little

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.390 
twice and then you kind of do a little
after<00:03:30.109> those<00:03:30.260> two<00:03:30.409> draws<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.920> breathing<00:03:31.250> on

for me it's one of the easier things I'm
just<00:04:37.729> going<00:04:38.240> for<00:04:38.449> a<00:04:38.510> tongue<00:04:38.780> block<00:04:39.020> on<00:04:39.289> the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
just going for a tongue block on the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.370 
just going for a tongue block on the
five<00:04:39.740> drop<00:04:40.099> that's<00:04:40.820> what<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.090> do

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170 

you<00:04:44.100> need<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.370> use<00:04:44.520> your<00:04:44.670> tongue<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.000> get<00:04:45.150> a

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
you need to use your tongue to get a

you need to use your tongue to get a
tongue<00:04:45.420> flutter<00:04:45.750> obviously<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.950> they<00:04:47.130> took

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
tongue flutter obviously so they took

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.950 
tongue flutter obviously so they took
all<00:04:47.400> my<00:04:47.430> tongues<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.850> little<00:04:48.030> below<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.360> comb<00:04:48.600> I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
all my tongues a little below the comb I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.820 
all my tongues a little below the comb I
slap<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.920> on<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.870> now<00:04:51.870> if<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.050> keep<00:04:52.320> slapping

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
slap it on that now if you keep slapping

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.220 
slap it on that now if you keep slapping
it<00:04:52.980> on<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.580> off<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.210> off<00:04:54.480> alternating

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
it on and off and on and off alternating

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.550 
it on and off and on and off alternating
between<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.530> cord<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.520> five<00:04:57.450> four<00:04:57.990> three<00:04:58.020> and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
between the cord of five four three and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.390 
between the cord of five four three and
two<00:04:58.760> and<00:05:00.140> then<00:05:01.140> you<00:05:01.500> know<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.950> single<00:05:02.370> knot

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
two and then you know that single knot

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.880 
two and then you know that single knot
just<00:05:05.400> practice<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:05.940> get<00:05:06.720> a<00:05:06.750> consistent<00:05:07.620> rate

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
just practice that get a consistent rate

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.380 
just practice that get a consistent rate
that's<00:05:08.220> what<00:05:08.340> you're<00:05:08.490> going<00:05:08.760> for<00:05:08.790> don't<00:05:09.240> worry

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
that's what you're going for don't worry

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.270 
that's what you're going for don't worry
about<00:05:09.600> going<00:05:09.720> super<00:05:10.230> fast<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.800> don't<00:05:11.040> you

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
about going super fast you don't you

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.730 
about going super fast you don't you
actually<00:05:11.940> don't<00:05:12.150> need<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.390> get<00:05:12.570> up<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.440> crazy

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
actually don't need to get up to a crazy

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.770 
actually don't need to get up to a crazy
speed<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.310> get<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.670> effect<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:17.660> can<00:05:18.660> go

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
speed to get this effect you can go

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.450 
speed to get this effect you can go
faster<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:21.330> all<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.870> need<00:05:22.020> is<00:05:25.250> alright<00:05:26.250> so

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
faster but all you need is alright so

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.220 
faster but all you need is alright so
that's<00:05:26.640> how<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:27.090> would<00:05:27.240> go<00:05:27.450> about<00:05:27.480> practicing

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
that's how I would go about practicing

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.080 
that's how I would go about practicing
just<00:05:28.470> go<00:05:28.620> for<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.890> consistent<00:05:29.430> speed<00:05:29.700> and<00:05:30.000> when

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
just go for a consistent speed and when

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.460 
just go for a consistent speed and when
you've<00:05:30.210> nailed<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.720> trying<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.110> increase<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
you've nailed it trying to increase that

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.610 
you've nailed it trying to increase that
speed<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.950> little<00:05:32.190> bit<00:05:32.460> more<00:05:33.230> this<00:05:34.230> one's<00:05:34.470> not

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
speed a little bit more this one's not

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.300 
speed a little bit more this one's not
in<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:35.510> moderator<00:05:36.510> section<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.830> it's<00:05:37.980> under

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
me about this so I'm gonna discover it

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.350 
me about this so I'm gonna discover it
it<00:05:43.050> quickly<00:05:43.730> hey<00:05:44.730> Ronnie<00:05:44.940> how<00:05:45.060> do<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.270> get

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
it quickly hey Ronnie how do you get

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.060 
it quickly hey Ronnie how do you get
that<00:05:45.450> vibrato<00:05:47.150> excuse<00:05:48.150> me<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:49.070> vibrato

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
that vibrato excuse me that vibrato

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.220 
that vibrato excuse me that vibrato
sounds<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:50.580> clean<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.480> crisp<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:51.960> how<00:05:52.080> do<00:05:52.140> you

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
sounds so clean and crisp and how do you

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.120 
sounds so clean and crisp and how do you
create<00:05:52.530> it<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:54.630> way<00:05:54.720> I<00:05:54.750> do<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.290> is<00:05:55.710> I<00:05:55.950> go

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
create it the way I do it is I go

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.490 
create it the way I do it is I go
through<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:56.760> know<00:05:57.210> for<00:05:57.570> like<00:05:57.720> let's<00:05:58.170> talk<00:05:58.410> about

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
through I know for like let's talk about

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.879 
through I know for like let's talk about
three<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:59.100> go<00:05:59.310> for<00:05:59.520> it

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.339 

right<00:06:03.879> around<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.300> half<00:06:04.479> step<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:04.930> maybe

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
right around the half step and maybe

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.589 
right around the half step and maybe
also<00:06:05.650> really<00:06:06.490> if<00:06:06.610> you<00:06:06.699> go<00:06:06.849> for<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.030> full<00:06:07.270> step

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
also really if you go for the full step

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.270 
also really if you go for the full step
this<00:06:07.960> would<00:06:08.199> be<00:06:08.289> effective<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:08.860> go<00:06:09.009> for<00:06:09.219> the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
this would be effective I go for the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.369 
this would be effective I go for the
bend<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:12.580> then<00:06:12.879> throw<00:06:13.120> in<00:06:13.300> a<00:06:13.479> tremolo<00:06:14.050> like

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
bend and then throw in a tremolo like

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.290 
bend and then throw in a tremolo like
effect<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.039> if<00:06:15.189> you<00:06:15.280> can't<00:06:15.490> do<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.639> tremolo<00:06:16.030> back

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
effect so if you can't do a tremolo back

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.520 
effect so if you can't do a tremolo back
up<00:06:16.509> and<00:06:16.659> work<00:06:16.810> on<00:06:16.990> just<00:06:17.199> three<00:06:17.590> draw<00:06:19.349> I'm<00:06:20.349> just

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
up and work on just three draw I'm just

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.330 
up and work on just three draw I'm just
going<00:06:21.750> just<00:06:22.750> breathe<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.110> in<00:06:23.229> like<00:06:23.379> that<00:06:23.590> slice

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
going just breathe it in like that slice

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.330 
going just breathe it in like that slice
in<00:06:24.490> that<00:06:24.639> air<00:06:24.819> and<00:06:26.009> once<00:06:27.009> you<00:06:27.099> can<00:06:27.219> get<00:06:27.310> a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
in that air and once you can get a

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.950 
in that air and once you can get a
tremolo<00:06:27.759> you<00:06:28.000> just<00:06:28.150> go<00:06:28.300> for<00:06:28.509> a<00:06:28.539> little<00:06:28.599> bit<00:06:28.870> of

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
tremolo you just go for a little bit of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.510 
tremolo you just go for a little bit of
a<00:06:29.020> bend<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.650> hold<00:06:32.830> the<00:06:32.979> position<00:06:33.370> of<00:06:33.460> the

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
a bend so you hold the position of the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.580 
a bend so you hold the position of the
bend<00:06:33.729> and<00:06:34.029> then<00:06:34.300> apply<00:06:34.779> that<00:06:34.810> tremolo

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
bend and then apply that tremolo

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.769 
bend and then apply that tremolo
technique<00:06:35.770> and<00:06:36.370> you'll<00:06:36.849> get<00:06:37.060> it<00:06:37.150> to<00:06:37.270> go<00:06:37.419> in<00:06:37.599> and

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
technique and you'll get it to go in and

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.110 
technique and you'll get it to go in and
out<00:06:37.870> a<00:06:37.900> Ben<00:06:38.439> draw<00:06:38.740> Ben<00:06:38.979> drop<00:06:39.250> and<00:06:39.490> draw<00:06:39.699> and

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
out a Ben draw Ben drop and draw and

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.779 
out a Ben draw Ben drop and draw and
it's<00:06:40.629> all<00:06:40.779> about<00:06:40.960> consistency<00:06:41.770> of<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.400> speed

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
it's all about consistency of the speed

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.790 
it's all about consistency of the speed
of<00:06:42.819> the<00:06:43.599> rate<00:06:44.259> of<00:06:44.289> the<00:06:44.469> speed<00:06:44.889> so<00:06:46.349> it's<00:06:47.349> not<00:06:47.560> so

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
of the rate of the speed so it's not so

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.469 
of the rate of the speed so it's not so
much<00:06:47.860> about<00:06:48.099> how<00:06:48.250> fast<00:06:48.639> can<00:06:48.939> I<00:06:49.000> get<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:49.330> it's

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
much about how fast can I get it it's

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.439 
much about how fast can I get it it's
how<00:06:49.599> consistent<00:06:50.379> a<00:06:51.060> slope<00:06:52.060> I<00:06:52.210> thought<00:06:52.419> Oh

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449 
how consistent a slope I thought Oh

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.830 
how consistent a slope I thought Oh
sounds<00:06:52.870> really<00:06:53.080> nice<00:06:56.610> and<00:06:57.610> there's<00:06:58.449> a<00:06:58.539> sweet

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
sounds really nice and there's a sweet

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.879 
sounds really nice and there's a sweet
spot<00:06:59.110> there<00:06:59.349> a<00:06:59.409> little<00:06:59.650> bit<00:06:59.800> faster
