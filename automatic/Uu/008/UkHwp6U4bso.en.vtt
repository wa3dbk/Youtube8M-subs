prices for lime so bartenders are

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
looking for other ingredients to replace

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.470 
looking for other ingredients to replace
the<00:00:07.020> lime<00:00:07.200> our<00:00:07.859> limes<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.030> reason<00:00:09.389> why

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the lime our limes now the reason why

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.790 
the lime our limes now the reason why
this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.690> happening<00:00:10.200> you're<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.469> you're

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this is happening you're in you're

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.379 
this is happening you're in you're
seeing<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.190> increase<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.790> prices<00:00:12.210> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
seeing this increase in prices is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.099 
seeing this increase in prices is
because<00:00:12.719> some<00:00:13.620> lime<00:00:13.889> trees<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.610> dealing<00:00:15.030> with

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
because some lime trees are dealing with

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.130 
because some lime trees are dealing with
bacterial<00:00:16.109> diseases<00:00:16.470> some<00:00:17.279> known<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.750> hlb<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
bacterial diseases some known as hlb and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710 
bacterial diseases some known as hlb and
also<00:00:19.800> climate<00:00:20.550> change<00:00:20.730> plays<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> role<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.420> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
also climate change plays a role in this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.259 
also climate change plays a role in this
the<00:00:22.410> weather<00:00:22.650> has<00:00:22.949> been<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.340> cold<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.000> rainy

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the weather has been very cold and rainy

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.779 
the weather has been very cold and rainy
in<00:00:24.630> areas<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.289> Mexico<00:00:25.800> where<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.160> grow<00:00:26.490> lime

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
in areas in Mexico where they grow lime

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.900 
in areas in Mexico where they grow lime
trees<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> result<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.189> limited

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
trees so as a result they have limited

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.479 
trees so as a result they have limited
supplies<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> sell<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.189> at<00:00:32.309> an

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
supplies and they have to sell it at an

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
supplies and they have to sell it at an
increased<00:00:33.000> price<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> farmers<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.559> make

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
increased price so the farmers can make

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.470 
increased price so the farmers can make
a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.130> money<00:00:35.309> well<00:00:35.910> there's<00:00:36.090> another

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
a little money well there's another

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
a little money well there's another
element<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.160> really

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
element to this that is actually really

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.869 
element to this that is actually really
really<00:00:38.760> scary<00:00:39.180> since<00:00:39.809> limes<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.340> hot

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really scary since limes are a hot

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.670 
really scary since limes are a hot
commodity<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.690> since<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.200> fewer<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
commodity and since there are fewer of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.639 
commodity and since there are fewer of
them<00:00:44.059> cartels<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.660> stopping<00:00:46.110> trucks

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
them cartels are now stopping trucks

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
them cartels are now stopping trucks

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
how much like hundreds of dollars

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160

the lime here so I like how climate

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170 
the lime here so I like how climate
change<00:01:21.450> has<00:01:22.040> worked<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> car<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> drug

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
most salient part of the story is once

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
most salient part of the story is once
you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.479> bad<00:01:49.020> laws<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.710> our<00:01:49.920> war<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.310> drugs

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you have bad laws like our war on drugs

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have bad laws like our war on drugs
and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.299> create<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> problem<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> drug

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and you create a problem like the drug

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.760 
and you create a problem like the drug
cartels<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.450> becomes<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.079> bigger<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
cartels it then becomes a bigger and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
cartels it then becomes a bigger and
bigger<00:01:55.979> problem<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.670> takes<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> life<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
bigger problem and takes on a life of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
bigger problem and takes on a life of

piece of our lives and they grew bigger
bigger<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.230> case<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.740> cutting<00:02:16.040> so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
bigger in this case it's cutting so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.150 
bigger in this case it's cutting so
absurd<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.239> large<00:02:17.650> they're<00:02:18.650> holding<00:02:19.040> our
