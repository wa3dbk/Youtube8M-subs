it's<00:01:45.000> star<00:01:45.420> rating<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.110> i'm<00:01:46.229> pretty<00:01:46.560> sure

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's star rating but i'm pretty sure

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.090 
it's star rating but i'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.310> match<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.850> by<00:01:48.000> skill<00:01:48.299> level

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's they match you by skill level

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.469 
it's they match you by skill level
Justin<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.340> online<00:01:50.700> versus<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.240> whatever

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
because I realized it is really easy for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.880 
because I realized it is really easy for
me<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.540> i<00:01:54.659> wanted<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.110> i<00:01:55.259> could<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> five

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679 
me if i wanted to i could get a five
star<00:01:56.159> team<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.299> team<00:01:57.509> at

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
star team and not have a good team at
all<00:01:57.920> that's<00:01:58.920> pretty<00:01:59.250> much<00:01:59.369> why<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.180> going

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
all that's pretty much why I'm not going

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.149

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
right you can't come down go backhand

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.410 
right you can't come down go backhand
forehand<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.670> expect<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> goalie

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
forehand and like just expect the goalie

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.580 
forehand and like just expect the goalie
to<00:03:18.570> be<00:03:18.690> at<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> other<00:03:18.989> side<00:03:19.260> they're<00:03:19.440> not

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to be at the other side they're not

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.990 
to be at the other side they're not
going<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.800> do<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> computer<00:03:20.760> goalie

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
going to do that it's a computer goalie

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.270 
going to do that it's a computer goalie
right<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.050> five<00:03:22.260> ways<00:03:22.500> i<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> score

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
right so the five ways i like the score

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.460 
right so the five ways i like the score
is<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.700> backhand<00:03:24.360> forehand<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:25.080> shoot<00:03:25.320> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
is the backhand forehand just shoot it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.830 
is the backhand forehand just shoot it
that<00:03:25.680> goes<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.070> sometimes<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:27.150> cross<00:03:27.450> creased

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that goes in sometimes the cross creased

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.420 
that goes in sometimes the cross creased
short<00:03:28.200> side<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.650> what<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.860> do<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.160> cross

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
short side so what you do is you cross

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.100 
short side so what you do is you cross
crease<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.910> then<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.120> cross<00:03:30.480> up<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> goalie

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
crease and then you cross up the goalie

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.449 
crease and then you cross up the goalie
you<00:03:31.350> don't<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.739> shoot<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.070> right<00:03:32.190> away<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you don't just shoot it right away you

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.130 
you don't just shoot it right away you
shoot<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.000> from<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> puck<00:03:33.630> came<00:03:33.930> from

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
shoot it from where the puck came from

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.949 
shoot it from where the puck came from
right<00:03:34.350> i<00:03:34.380> find<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.010> works<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.370> lot<00:03:35.959> another

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
right i find that works a lot another

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.530 
right i find that works a lot another
thing<00:03:37.739> i<00:03:37.890> do<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.489> shoot<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.209> sniped
