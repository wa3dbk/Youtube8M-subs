00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
they say sidearms can shoot rapidly now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.320 
they say sidearms can shoot rapidly now
we<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> hand<00:01:05.880> cannons

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we all know because of hand cannons

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.230 
we all know because of hand cannons
immense<00:01:06.810> power<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.680> fire<00:01:08.040> rate<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.549> slow<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
immense power the fire rate is slow and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
immense power the fire rate is slow and
by<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> sounds<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> side<00:01:10.799> arms<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
by the sounds of it side arms will have

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
by the sounds of it side arms will have
a<00:01:11.610> fast<00:01:12.119> fiery<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.740> normally<00:01:14.310> means<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
a fast fiery and that normally means a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600 
a fast fiery and that normally means a
low<00:01:15.240> impact<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.080> let's<00:01:16.409> back<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.979> theory<00:01:17.430> up

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
low impact but let's back that theory up

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
low impact but let's back that theory up
let's<00:01:17.970> take<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> weapon<00:01:19.590> stairs

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
let's take a look at the weapon stairs

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
let's take a look at the weapon stairs
so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.939> confirmed<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> fiery<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so it is confirmed the fiery is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
so it is confirmed the fiery is
extremely<00:01:23.490> high<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.240> naturally<00:01:24.869> means<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
extremely high which naturally means the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.649 
extremely high which naturally means the
impact<00:01:25.770> will<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.009> extremely<00:01:26.520> low<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
impact will be extremely low now as you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.020 
impact will be extremely low now as you
can<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.320> range<00:01:28.590> isn't<00:01:28.920> too<00:01:29.460> great<00:01:29.700> either

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
can see the range isn't too great either

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
can see the range isn't too great either
now<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> does<00:01:30.990> show<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> stability

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
now it does show here that the stability

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
now it does show here that the stability
and<00:01:32.340> reload<00:01:32.970> speeds<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> maxed<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and reload speeds are maxed but from the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.310 
and reload speeds are maxed but from the
footage<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.189> screen<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.119> gun<00:01:36.390> looks<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
footage on screen the gun looks as if it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.800 
footage on screen the gun looks as if it
kicks<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
kicks a lot so my guess is that this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
kicks a lot so my guess is that this
weapon<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.860> useful<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.549> particular

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
weapon will be useful in particular

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270 
weapon will be useful in particular
situations<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> footage<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> you're

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
situations so the footage that you're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950 
situations so the footage that you're
watching<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> screen<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.570> actually

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
watching on the screen here is actually

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.139 
watching on the screen here is actually
taken<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> stream<00:01:47.070> yesterday<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.759> Matt

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
taken from the stream yesterday and Matt

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.020 
taken from the stream yesterday and Matt
salmon<00:01:48.420> says<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.049> loud<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.829> clear<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
salmon says out loud and clear it has a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
salmon says out loud and clear it has a
special<00:01:51.720> perk<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> fallen<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.490> he

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
special perk for the fallen in which he

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
special perk for the fallen in which he
meant<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.450> weapon<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.229> increased<00:01:55.860> damage

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
meant this weapon does increased damage

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.700 
meant this weapon does increased damage
to<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> Fallen<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.960> will<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.200> extremely

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to the Fallen so this will be extremely

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
to the Fallen so this will be extremely
useful<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> prison<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> elders<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> some

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
useful in the prison of elders and some

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
useful in the prison of elders and some
