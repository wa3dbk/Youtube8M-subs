00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
Keselowski for the leader but what we

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
Keselowski for the leader but what we
don't<00:00:08.519> know<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> telemetry<00:00:09.690> will<00:00:09.990> be

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
don't know is what a telemetry will be

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.509 
don't know is what a telemetry will be
in<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.349> Challenger<00:00:10.830> now<00:00:10.860> because<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> last

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
in this Challenger now because the last

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.780 
in this Challenger now because the last
challenge<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:12.120> none<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.830> no<00:00:14.009> idea<00:00:14.519> if

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
challenge had none so I have no idea if

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.210 
challenge had none so I have no idea if
we're<00:00:15.120> doing<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.139> telemetry<00:00:16.500> challenge<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.190> not

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we're doing a telemetry challenge or not

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.370 
we're doing a telemetry challenge or not
the<00:00:18.090> way<00:00:18.240> those<00:00:18.449> two<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.840> moving<00:00:19.289> around

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
the way those two are moving around

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170 
the way those two are moving around
especially<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> 20<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.640> makes<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.150> think

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
especially that 20 and makes me think

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
especially that 20 and makes me think
there's<00:00:21.539> telemetry<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> 20<00:00:23.160> s<00:00:23.250> moving

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
there's telemetry there's a 20 s moving

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.509 
there's telemetry there's a 20 s moving
Matt<00:00:23.640> ah<00:00:23.850> Chloe<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> down<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> track<00:00:25.519> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
Matt ah Chloe up and down the track so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.620 
Matt ah Chloe up and down the track so
we're<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.670> gonna<00:00:26.849> assume<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
we're just gonna assume there is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.620 
we're just gonna assume there is
telemetry<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> challenge<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.630> after

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
telemetry on this challenge but after

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.030 
telemetry on this challenge but after
that<00:00:30.779> wash<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.410> can't<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.740> anything

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that wash out you can't take anything

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.930 
that wash out you can't take anything
for<00:00:32.160> granted

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for granted

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120

thing I want to say it's one tender
let's<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:45.059> depends<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.450> how<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.719> guy

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
let's see it depends on how this guy

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.729 
let's see it depends on how this guy
races<00:00:46.379> me<00:00:46.820> hey<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.629> he<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.469> cuts

races me hey like if he just like cuts
me<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:49.950> constantly<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:50.930> there's<00:00:51.930> telemetry

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
me off constantly then there's telemetry

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
me off constantly then there's telemetry
involved<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.850> cuts<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
turn one right now but I'm clearly on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.510 
turn one right now but I'm clearly on
the<00:00:56.550> inside<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.149> telemetry<00:00:58.309> yeah<00:00:59.309> yeah

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the inside there's telemetry yeah yeah

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
the inside there's telemetry yeah yeah
look<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> telemetry<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.989> gonna<00:01:01.140> add

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
look at that telemetry we're gonna add

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
look at that telemetry we're gonna add
some<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> tree<00:01:01.949> oh<00:01:02.070> yeah

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
some on the tree oh yeah

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.070 
some on the tree oh yeah
some<00:01:02.969> trees<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.539> challenge<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.019> sure

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
some trees into this challenge for sure

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.429 
some trees into this challenge for sure
found<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> hard<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> guess<00:01:07.229> they

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
found out the hard way so I guess they

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
found out the hard way so I guess they
didn't<00:01:07.740> release<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> telemetry<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
didn't release the telemetry because of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
didn't release the telemetry because of
just<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.619> happen<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> end<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
just because what happen at the end of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
just because what happen at the end of
the<00:01:11.580> race<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.090> Michael<00:01:12.570> Waltrip<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.530> 55

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the race with Michael Waltrip on the 55

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
the race with Michael Waltrip on the 55
and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.580> 15<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.119> hitting<00:01:15.479> intentionally

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and the 15 like hitting intentionally

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830 
and the 15 like hitting intentionally
and<00:01:16.080> stuff<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.009> plus<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> 38<00:01:18.000> lag

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and stuff like that and plus the 38 lag

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
and stuff like that and plus the 38 lag
Bank<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.350> Joey<00:01:19.590> Logano<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.520> boot<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
Bank for Joey Logano just the boot so I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.060 
Bank for Joey Logano just the boot so I
guess<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.770> NASCAR

with your technics to make sure they
didn't<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.630> nonetheless<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
didn't I don't know but nonetheless that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.929 
didn't I don't know but nonetheless that
challenge<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.220> whatever<00:01:32.340> reasons<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.820> that
