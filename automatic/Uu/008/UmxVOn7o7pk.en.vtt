little<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> weighs<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
little bit here how it weighs down the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
little bit here how it weighs down the
middle<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> blade<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.470> makes<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> speed

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
middle of the blade which makes it speed

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
middle of the blade which makes it speed
faster<00:01:14.460> start<00:01:15.180> solids<00:01:15.450> Stabenow<00:01:16.320> tight

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
faster start solids Stabenow tight

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.359 
faster start solids Stabenow tight
because<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.240> spins<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.369> also

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
