00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
system starts to track off there towards

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
system starts to track off there towards
the<00:01:45.180> west<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:45.990> by<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.380> see

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the west and what I mean by that you see

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.380 
the west and what I mean by that you see
that<00:01:46.799> center<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> circulation<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.970> those

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that center of circulation here those

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
that center of circulation here those
winds<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.840> wrap<00:01:49.049> around<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.560> they'll<00:01:49.649> come

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
winds will wrap around and they'll come

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.160 
winds will wrap around and they'll come
in<00:01:49.890> from<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.549> direction<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.899> when

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
in from this direction and that's when

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.380 
in from this direction and that's when
you<00:01:52.259> start<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.189> push<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.240> on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you start to see that water push up on

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
you start to see that water push up on
shore<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.200> create<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> threat<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
shore and could create that threat of a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.510 
shore and could create that threat of a
rising<00:01:57.030> sea<00:01:57.840> level<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.250> definitely

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
rising sea level so this is definitely

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
rising sea level so this is definitely
not<00:01:59.790> over<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.360> any<00:02:00.390> means<00:02:00.869> people<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.409> know<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
not over by any means people I know that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
not over by any means people I know that
we<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.159> starting<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.549> those<00:02:02.729> images<00:02:02.969> out

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we are starting to see those images out

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.730 
we are starting to see those images out
of<00:02:03.329> Tacloban<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.990> winds<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.380> starting<00:02:04.560> to

of Tacloban the winds are starting to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
of Tacloban the winds are starting to
calm<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.909> those<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> across

I<00:02:13.520> mean<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.120> go<00:02:14.270> back<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.690> official<00:02:15.050> track

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.500 
I mean we go back to the official track
here<00:02:15.620> Dawson<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.340> say<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.120> been

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
here Dawson I do say that they have been

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
here Dawson I do say that they have been
doing<00:02:17.660> actually<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> fairly<00:02:18.410> decent<00:02:18.620> job

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
doing actually a fairly decent job

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.120 
doing actually a fairly decent job

at<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.270> time<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.230> you're<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.250> be

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
at this time but you're going to be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130 
at this time but you're going to be
hopefully<00:02:29.090> missing<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.810> brunt<00:02:30.020> of

hopefully missing out on the brunt of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.510 
hopefully missing out on the brunt of
the<00:02:30.230> storm<00:02:30.260> still<00:02:30.710> could<00:02:30.860> see<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> coastal

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
the storm still could see a coastal

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.190 
the storm still could see a coastal
storm<00:02:31.610> search<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.540> think<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> worst<00:02:33.020> of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
storm search but I think the worst of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.690 
storm search but I think the worst of
it's<00:02:33.350> farther<00:02:33.710> down<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.070> towards<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> south

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
it's farther down here towards the south

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.020 
it's farther down here towards the south

manila also on under signal Force One at
this<00:02:38.330> time<00:02:38.660> you're<00:02:38.990> probably<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.590> be

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
this time you're probably going to be

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.860 
this time you're probably going to be
seeing<00:02:39.920> some<00:02:40.310> gusty<00:02:40.730> winds<00:02:40.940> likely<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.750> had

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
seeing some gusty winds likely as we had

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.390 
seeing some gusty winds likely as we had
in<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.080> Monday<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.890> think<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.160> bigger

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
in the Monday but I think the bigger

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.620 
in the Monday but I think the bigger
threat<00:02:43.850> that's<00:02:44.030> going<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.300> be<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> bigger

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
threat that's going to be the bigger

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.510 
threat that's going to be the bigger
impact<00:02:45.140> from<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> storm<00:02:45.860> system<00:02:46.070> when<00:02:46.400> it's

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
impact from the storm system when it's

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.160 
impact from the storm system when it's
all<00:02:46.700> said<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.030> done<00:02:47.210> is<00:02:47.450> will<00:02:47.720> be<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
all said and done is will be the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.320 
all said and done is will be the
rainfall<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.460> just<00:02:49.670> showing<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.060> rain

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330

slow the storm will be weakening as it
