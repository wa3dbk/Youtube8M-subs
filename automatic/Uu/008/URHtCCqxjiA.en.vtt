00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.210 
us through this so what we wanted to do
with<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.280> is<00:01:46.520> absolutely<00:01:47.180> eliminate<00:01:47.869> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
with this is absolutely eliminate the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.050 
with this is absolutely eliminate the
barriers<00:01:49.220> between<00:01:49.369> physical<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:49.970> digital

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
barriers between physical and digital

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.690 
barriers between physical and digital
play<00:01:50.469> so<00:01:51.469> rather<00:01:51.680> than<00:01:51.829> just<00:01:51.890> been<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.340> spawning

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
play so rather than just been a spawning

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.090 
play so rather than just been a spawning
device<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.689> toy<00:01:54.229> part<00:01:54.469> actually<00:01:54.829> becomes

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
device the toy part actually becomes

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.490 
device the toy part actually becomes
controller<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:56.960> see<00:01:57.049> here<00:01:57.229> John

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
controller so as you can see here John

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.370 
controller so as you can see here John
is<00:01:57.740> very<00:01:58.009> kindly<00:01:58.340> demonstrating<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.390> when

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
is very kindly demonstrating that when

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.920 
is very kindly demonstrating that when
you<00:02:00.619> access<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.280> toy<00:02:01.610> piping<00:02:01.939> panics<00:02:02.270> it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
you access the toy piping panics it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.499 
you access the toy piping panics it
becomes<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.619> sort<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.040> virtual<00:02:04.670> teleportation

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
becomes a sort of virtual teleportation

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
becomes a sort of virtual teleportation
device<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.049> as<00:02:06.409> he<00:02:06.560> moves<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.950> characters

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
device and as he moves the characters

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.740 
device and as he moves the characters
from<00:02:07.399> one<00:02:07.490> collar<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> toy<00:02:08.390> pad<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
from one collar of the toy pad to the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.690 
from one collar of the toy pad to the
other<00:02:08.929> they<00:02:09.259> teleport<00:02:09.769> through<00:02:09.920> these<00:02:10.100> rifts

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
other they teleport through these rifts

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.289 
other they teleport through these rifts
right<00:02:11.950> great<00:02:12.950> GLaDOS<00:02:13.280> these<00:02:13.430> rules<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.150> it's

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
right great GLaDOS these rules so it's

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.729 
right great GLaDOS these rules so it's
really<00:02:14.510> tactile<00:02:14.840> right<00:02:15.290> it's<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.650> yeah

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
really tactile right it's like yeah

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.349 
really tactile right it's like yeah
they're<00:02:15.860> not<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.160> putting<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.760> minifigs<00:02:17.150> on

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
they're not just putting the minifigs on

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:17.800 
they're not just putting the minifigs on
there

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
there

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.539 
there
and<00:02:18.079> kind<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.350> leave<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.799> no<00:02:19.160> no<00:02:19.280> you're

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
and kind of leave in them no no you're

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.890 
and kind of leave in them no no you're
constantly<00:02:19.970> interacting<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.720> poor

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
constantly interacting with the poor

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.960 
constantly interacting with the poor
minifigs<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.709> game<00:02:21.980> yeah<00:02:22.129> it's<00:02:22.400> bringing

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
minifigs in the game yeah it's bringing

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.949 
minifigs in the game yeah it's bringing
in<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.180> bridging<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.569> gap<00:02:23.780> between

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
in that bridging that gap between

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.479 
in that bridging that gap between
physical<00:02:24.439> and<00:02:24.590> digital<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.189> these<00:02:25.370> are

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
physical and digital and these are

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.250 
physical and digital and these are
proper<00:02:25.819> minifigs<00:02:26.209> as<00:02:26.329> well<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.689> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
proper minifigs as well right this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.449 
proper minifigs as well right this
earlier<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.739> we<00:02:27.829> actually<00:02:27.980> disassemble

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
earlier can we actually disassemble

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.880 
earlier can we actually disassemble
these<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.120> tear<00:02:29.239> them<00:02:29.390> apart

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
these and tear them apart

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.899 
these and tear them apart
it<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.189> 100%<00:02:32.000> Lego<00:02:32.750> toy<00:02:33.670> fantastic<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
it is 100% Lego toy fantastic so that

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.190 
it is 100% Lego toy fantastic so that
means<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.329> course<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.689> can<00:02:35.870> use<00:02:36.049> them

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
just keep one set one side well you mash

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.210 
just keep one set one side well you mash
them<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.109> together<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.890> was<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.010> whole

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
them all together that was the whole

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.280 
them all together that was the whole
idea<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:46.730> game<00:02:46.909> there's<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.930> much<00:02:48.109> point

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
idea of the game there's not much point

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.750 
idea of the game there's not much point
in<00:02:48.409> having<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.709> toys<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.099> life<00:02:49.129> game<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.670> you
