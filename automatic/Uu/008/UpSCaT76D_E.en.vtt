so<00:00:10.440> let's<00:00:10.679> think<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.550> body<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
so let's think about the body and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.820 
so let's think about the body and
entrepreneurial<00:00:13.019> terms<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.769> in

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
entrepreneurial terms and in

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.029 
entrepreneurial terms and in
technological<00:00:14.340> terms<00:00:15.740> reading<00:00:16.740> through<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
technological terms reading through the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.099 
technological terms reading through the
book<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.310> getting<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> sense<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> you're

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
book and getting the sense that you're

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.679 
book and getting the sense that you're
treating<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.680> body<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> start-up<00:00:20.850> is

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
treating the body like a start-up is

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.080 
treating the body like a start-up is
that<00:00:21.900> faster<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.560> accurate<00:00:23.189> I'd<00:00:23.820> say<00:00:23.880> as

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that faster for accurate I'd say as

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.700 
that faster for accurate I'd say as
accurate<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.400> accurate<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> sense<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
accurate and accurate in the sense that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.960 
accurate and accurate in the sense that
in<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> start-up<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.550> involved<00:00:29.760> with

stumbleupon<00:00:35.160> evernote<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.300> these

stumbleupon evernote a lot of these
companies<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.980> i<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
companies and i think one of the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.680 
companies and i think one of the
characteristics<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.180> makes<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
characteristics that makes a very

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
characteristics that makes a very
effective<00:00:39.960> startup<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.500> understanding<00:00:41.250> your

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
effective startup is understanding your

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
effective startup is understanding your
inputs<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.540> outputs<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.579> measuring

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
inputs and your outputs and measuring

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
inputs and your outputs and measuring
the<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> matter<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.590> make

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the things that matter and you can make

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
the things that matter and you can make
mistakes<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.910> example<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> start-up<00:00:48.809> if

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
mistakes so for example as a start-up if

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.950 
mistakes so for example as a start-up if
you<00:00:49.110> measure<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:50.190> pageviews<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.690> broad

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you measure just pageviews in some broad

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
you measure just pageviews in some broad
sense<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.160> nearly<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.550> interesting

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
sense that's not nearly as interesting

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
sense that's not nearly as interesting
or<00:00:54.660> actionable<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:56.010> say<00:00:56.160> seven<00:00:56.520> day

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
or actionable as let's say seven day

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
or actionable as let's say seven day
active<00:00:57.090> seven-day<00:00:57.840> actives<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
active seven-day actives and I think in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.110 
active seven-day actives and I think in
the<00:00:59.460> body<00:01:00.410> nutrition<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.980> where<00:01:02.250> surgery<00:01:02.850> was

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the body nutrition is where surgery was

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.649 
the body nutrition is where surgery was
in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.660> 16-month<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> 1600s<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.240> very

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in the 16-month in the 1600s it's very

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
in the 16-month in the 1600s it's very
primitive<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.500> people<00:01:07.619> say<00:01:07.890> calories<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
primitive so when people say calories in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.510 
primitive so when people say calories in
calories<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.770> one<00:01:10.770> example<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.369> don't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
calories out as one example they don't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
calories out as one example they don't
realize<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.659> doesn't<00:01:12.689> mean<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> only

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
realize that it doesn't mean the only

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.990 
realize that it doesn't mean the only
way<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.830> rid<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.010> calories<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.549> exercise

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
way to get rid of calories is exercise

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.280 
way to get rid of calories is exercise
you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.299> also<00:01:15.509> use<00:01:16.369> heat<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.850> also<00:01:18.090> use

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
you can also use heat you can also use

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
you can also use heat you can also use
excretion<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.009> tweak<00:01:20.820> digestion

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
excretion you can also tweak digestion

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
excretion you can also tweak digestion
there<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> lot<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> ways<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.470> play<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there a lot of ways to play with that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.109 
there a lot of ways to play with that
equation<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.670> having

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
equation and so I would say that having

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
equation and so I would say that having
a<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.479> clear<00:01:27.750> idea<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
a very clear idea of not just the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.730 
a very clear idea of not just the
numbers<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> numbers<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.150> matter

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
numbers but the numbers that matter

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.749 
numbers but the numbers that matter
Warren<00:01:31.740> Buffett's<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.250> famous<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
Warren Buffett's very famous for

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
Warren Buffett's very famous for
emphasizing<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.990> critically

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
emphasizing that it is critically

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.370 
emphasizing that it is critically
important<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.369> looking<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:35.970> things<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
important so also looking at things like

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
important so also looking at things like
body<00:01:37.380> fat<00:01:37.619> percentage<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.340> opposed<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.970> wait

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
body fat percentage as opposed to wait

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.600 
body fat percentage as opposed to wait
so<00:01:39.780> you'll<00:01:39.990> find<00:01:40.439> people<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.130> frequently

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so you'll find people very frequently

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.810 
so you'll find people very frequently
get<00:01:42.600> demoralized<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.860> they're<00:01:44.009> dieting<00:01:44.729> or

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
get demoralized when they're dieting or

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
get demoralized when they're dieting or
exercising<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.170> were<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> only<00:01:46.590> look

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
exercising and if they were to only look

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
exercising and if they were to only look
at<00:01:46.920> their<00:01:47.040> body<00:01:47.250> fat<00:01:47.460> composition<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:48.180> would

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
at their body fat composition they would

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
at their body fat composition they would
realize<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> they're<00:01:48.750> gaining<00:01:49.020> muscle<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
realize that they're gaining muscle and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
realize that they're gaining muscle and
losing<00:01:49.649> fat<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> same<00:01:50.130> time<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> really

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
losing fat at the same time so really

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.440 
losing fat at the same time so really
learning<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> focus<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.070> numbers

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
learning to focus on the right numbers

knowledge economy I think it's

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
absolutely a way for people to not only

absolutely a way for people to not only

themselves<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.019> there's<00:02:24.980> this

and it's simply not true so when you

hour hour and a half later and the only

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
way you figure that out is by doing

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.890 
way you figure that out is by doing
self-experimentation<00:02:56.629> but<00:02:57.470> since<00:02:58.189> I've<00:02:58.370> done

self-experimentation but since I've done

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.970 
self-experimentation but since I've done
thousands<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.989> blood<00:03:00.200> tests<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.590> had<00:03:00.769> other

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
thousands of blood tests and had other

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.309 
thousands of blood tests and had other
people<00:03:01.159> do<00:03:01.459> hundreds<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:02.000> experiments<00:03:02.480> you

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
people do hundreds of experiments you

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.809 
people do hundreds of experiments you
don't<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.799> be<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:04.010> guinea<00:03:04.159> pig<00:03:04.250> to

don't have to be the guinea pig to

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.690 
don't have to be the guinea pig to
benefit<00:03:05.299> from<00:03:05.329> from<00:03:06.049> one<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.769> do<00:03:07.340> think

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
benefit from from one but I do think

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.750 
benefit from from one but I do think
that<00:03:07.930> we're<00:03:08.950> entering<00:03:09.950> into<00:03:10.129> an<00:03:10.310> era<00:03:10.489> right

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
that we're entering into an era right

that we're entering into an era right

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that allows you to really take control

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.860 
that allows you to really take control
of<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:15.829> own<00:03:15.889> data<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.579> make<00:03:17.180> very<00:03:17.510> rapid

measurable results very very quickly and
it's<00:03:52.790> important<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.479> measurable<00:03:53.780> and

would it be fair to say that this book

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
is in some senses and assault on

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.000 
is in some senses and assault on
traditional<00:04:04.729> medicine<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.530> think<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.680> an

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
traditional medicine I think it's an

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.729 
traditional medicine I think it's an
assault<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.579> traditional<00:04:08.500> diagnostics<00:04:09.500> and

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
assault on traditional diagnostics and

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.629 
assault on traditional diagnostics and
that<00:04:10.069> would<00:04:10.340> include<00:04:10.750> much<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.930> Medicine

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
that would include much of Medicine

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.210 
that would include much of Medicine
sadly<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:14.269> practice<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.079> of<00:04:15.530> Western

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
sadly the practice of of Western

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.409 
sadly the practice of of Western
medicine<00:04:16.609> tends<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.060> focus<00:04:17.209> on<00:04:17.630> associating<00:04:18.229> a

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
medicine tends to focus on associating a

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.149 
medicine tends to focus on associating a
condition<00:04:20.419> or<00:04:20.630> symptom<00:04:21.289> with<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.889> drug

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
condition or symptom with a drug

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.960 
condition or symptom with a drug
treatment<00:04:22.400> it's<00:04:22.760> very<00:04:23.029> seldom<00:04:23.840> predictive<00:04:24.800> so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
treatment it's very seldom predictive so

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.460 
treatment it's very seldom predictive so
one<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> things<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.230> book's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
one of the things that this book's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.710 
one of the things that this book's
allows<00:04:27.920> people<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.310> do<00:04:28.460> very<00:04:28.670> easily<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:29.270> trend

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
allows people to do very easily is trend

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.990 
allows people to do very easily is trend

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
you go into an unacceptable range

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.410 
you go into an unacceptable range
whereas<00:04:46.160> if<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.400> were<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.610> actually<00:04:46.760> track<00:04:47.210> it

whereas if you were to actually track it

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.210 
whereas if you were to actually track it
you<00:04:47.510> could<00:04:47.690> see<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> trending<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.100> could

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
you could see the trending and you could

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.040 
you could see the trending and you could
fix<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.670> very<00:04:50.090> very<00:04:50.270> easily<00:04:50.540> very<00:04:50.690> very

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
fix it very very easily very very

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.770 
fix it very very easily very very
quickly<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.500> inexpensively<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.330> tripled

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
quickly and inexpensively so I tripled

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.080 
quickly and inexpensively so I tripled
my<00:04:53.900> testosterone<00:04:54.280> using<00:04:55.280> diet<00:04:55.550> alone<00:04:55.850> which

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
my testosterone using diet alone which

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.120 
my testosterone using diet alone which
is<00:04:56.240> something<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:56.630> think<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.870> lot<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.380> lot<00:04:57.980> of

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
is something I think a lot of a lot of

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.750 
is something I think a lot of a lot of
mental<00:04:58.370> benefit<00:04:58.760> from<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.950> it's<00:05:01.100> it's<00:05:01.340> very

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
mental benefit from but it's it's very

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.610 
mental benefit from but it's it's very
simple<00:05:02.120> doesn't<00:05:02.540> need<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> be<00:05:02.840> complex<00:05:03.380> but

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
simple doesn't need to be complex but

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.240 
simple doesn't need to be complex but
it's<00:05:04.160> definitely<00:05:04.370> an<00:05:04.610> assault<00:05:04.970> on<00:05:05.180> how

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
it's definitely an assault on how

it's definitely an assault on how

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.690 
problems are addressed currently at
least<00:05:08.420> in<00:05:08.540> Western<00:05:08.870> society<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:10.310> trip<00:05:10.550> with

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
least in Western society you trip with

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.870 
least in Western society you trip with
your<00:05:10.820> tourist<00:05:11.740> testosterone<00:05:12.740> did<00:05:13.010> you<00:05:13.160> triple

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
your tourist testosterone did you triple

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.600 
your tourist testosterone did you triple
your<00:05:14.360> girlfriend<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.170> boyfriend<00:05:16.160> oh<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:18.610> didn't

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
your girlfriend to boyfriend oh I didn't

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.270 
your girlfriend to boyfriend oh I didn't
triple<00:05:19.940> girlfriends<00:05:20.780> or<00:05:21.280> boyfriends

triple girlfriends or boyfriends

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.600 
triple girlfriends or boyfriends
certainly<00:05:22.640> not<00:05:23.740> as<00:05:24.740> far<00:05:24.980> as<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.160> girlfriends

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
certainly not as far as the girlfriends

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580 
certainly not as far as the girlfriends
gone<00:05:25.760> I<00:05:25.820> think<00:05:26.030> probably<00:05:26.290> one<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.470> other

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
gone I think probably one of the other

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.920 
gone I think probably one of the other
chapters<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.220> more<00:05:28.430> appropriate<00:05:29.030> number

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
chapters is more appropriate number

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.960 
chapters is more appropriate number
chapters<00:05:30.320> on<00:05:30.470> sexual<00:05:31.250> performance<00:05:31.430> and

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
chapters on sexual performance and

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.870 
chapters on sexual performance and
addition<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.450> sleep<00:05:32.720> and<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:32.990> forth<00:05:33.460> no<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.490> did

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
addition to sleep and so forth no I did

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.570 
addition to sleep and so forth no I did
also<00:05:35.120> double<00:05:35.570> my<00:05:35.690> sperm<00:05:35.960> count<00:05:35.990> though<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:37.070> so

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
also double my sperm count though and so

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.460 
also double my sperm count though and so
just<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.360> type<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:38.960> practical<00:05:39.500> demonstration

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
just a type of practical demonstration
