00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 the rural nucleus of taquara in the district 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
 have chili that does not end 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 the tradition of more than 12 years in the cultivation 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 of the fruit has attracted attention by the high 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 productivity of growing feet 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 according to data from the emater productivity 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 in the country is 60 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 tonnes per hectare plus this number 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 increases in the rural core 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.279
 taquara for 80 tons and the secret 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.230
 good results in the cultivation of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.439
 Chili is high tech maid 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.809
 more than 80 producers in the region 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969
 most of the production is done in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.910
 of greenhouses with screens that inhibit 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 presence of insects each greenhouse have three 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.620
 feet and the producers already 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.559
 think of increasing the height for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 further improve the generation of effort 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 which should reduce the effects of climate 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.390
 region in the development of the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 plant 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.949
 We're going to use some system that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 It will allow us to have a 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.629
 temperature a little to mine inside the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.930
 greenhouse that period right now one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 hot period at night cools 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 much during the hot day so we 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.590
 has a temperature oscillation 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 very high and the plant felt very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 then we will use a system that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.470
 will allow to reduce this oscillation 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
 between day and night 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 cultivation has grown so much that it has already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.790
 supplies the cities of other states 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.600
 such as Manaus Old Port and White River in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.670
 acre 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 the core cooperative delivers the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 product packed in supermarkets 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.350
 fresh and ready for consumption are 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 sold more than 150 tonnes of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.009
 peppers per month 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 chili is an employment generator 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.899
 because it brings technology that is 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 produced today in our region in great 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.390
 part the protected crop 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.670
 this demand technology demand hand of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.399
 then he is a generator of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.799
 employment directly from the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.079
 chili occurs all year round fruits 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.939
 yellow and red stay longer in the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.979
 foot to maturity 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.860
 which increases production by the largest 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.450
 pest control period 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.950
 preventive sprays are made 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
 once a week 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.480
 this year the attention was doubled by 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.519
 presence of the whitefly increased in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 average one two weekly sprays 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.500
 with some kind of insecticide to try 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.879
 this handle this large amount of 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 flies attacked this year in January 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.060
 February and March 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.110
 now in this period that we are 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.120
 more dry 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 we do not have problems with her anymore 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 we have several others that come along 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 of the culture cycle
