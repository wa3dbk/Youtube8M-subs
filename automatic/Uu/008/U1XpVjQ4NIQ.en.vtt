00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.259
 good 3 - to 1 good video tells us the 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.990
 quite interesting and important truth 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.030
 It seems that good could have been 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.560
 already filtered the name of the next call 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 of duty you know we all speculate 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.950
 with that it was black ops 3 and it seems to be 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 almost already we would say 670 80 percent 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.660
 that could become so, so 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 well little by little the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.289
 solutions for people to be a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.430
 wall of war 2 already looked good 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.140
 this has come for a signature of a one 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.110
 digital games research 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.820
 called super data have leaked a couple 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 of de facto titles not only black ops 3 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.950
 also 'resident evil' 7 not all of this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.630
 has come because he has extended a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.579
 little eye sale of rotated good 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.380
 quite a bit not quite in 2014 has 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.630
 descended quite the sale of games 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.059
 digital and good have said that good 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.100
 that later on they will continue to rise 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 this year because of the departure of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 black ops 3 as they have highlighted and the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.140
 next resident evil resident evil 7 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 with which then we will see in the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 truth I do not think it's a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.070
 mistake you know that this kind of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.740
 signatures d 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 of good research and others that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.900
 they collect data and all this has 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.060
 quite how to say the data 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 logically that they facilitate the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.770
 companies companies and others with which 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 it may be quite possible that the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.630
 game title is black ops 3 and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.460
 this year we have a new resident evil 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.479
 let's say the new recent 1007 because 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.610
 they have not referred to resident evil 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.020
 revelations 2 I do not know we 'll see to see what 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.400
 is what happens for now is also 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.630
 say how good that this news also 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 he has given it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 charlin tel charlin is also a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.899
 fan of the industry we could 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 to say that you see that you are quite involved 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.340
 in what is the subject of activision and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.369
 others has a lot of collaboration in 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.960
 those issues and every time you hunt a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.479
 rumor are ending confirming in fact I've 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 seen as many rumors dodge and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.200
 this for example they have not avoided it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
 not at all with which, as this adds up 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.910
 a little more reliability 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 to the news the being before was a 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.320
 page that did not work directly with 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.210
 activision and now by is quite 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.010
 pretty much more closely with what 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.710
 which always to keep in mind the 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.570
 news that these gentlemen are giving 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.800
 I do not take them very much into account because as 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.410
 I say well that we will see be is finished 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.630
 calling whites 3 in May we will know 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.390
 is when only the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.930
 game and nothing will see to see if they continue with 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.330
 the brand that has sold so many 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.460
 probably given yes and we will see to see 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.080
 everything else the truth and the next 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.250
 President's recent bill 7 to see 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 when it arises we did not know 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.940
 absolutely nothing and he is finished 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 presenting at e3 or even earlier 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.390
 we will see to see in supposedly 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.460
 also this year so we will not have anything 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.050
 what to expect to see what else happens and nothing 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.490
 guys to keep waiting see you in 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.490
 the next video and until next time
