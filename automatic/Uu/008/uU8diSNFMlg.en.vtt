00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello oitwt's all good as long as it is 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.810
 You too are calm. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 Your good TV burial I think I 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.369
 I can say that that is native 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.030
 needing 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 there is just want to buy a tv pro tv has to 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.010
 be sony network and have no sony talk 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 no, because only sony tv has a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.130
 ex reality show processor is difficult 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.399
 it is not so the pretension is necessary that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.460
 who does the sony tv is japanese right? 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.620
 and so now imagine that within the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 tv has a lot of electronic little things 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.450
 she knows it seems complicated but 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.790
 think that these little things that work 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.860
 no bunch of mini japanese just 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.030
 taking care to make the image of your tv 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.250
 stay with the beautiful image and that's the people 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 Have you ever seen real Japanese tallman every 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.769
 ten it's not clear that not right 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.390
 so you know what happens to the colors of tv 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.820
 they are much more alive and with a beauty 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.950
 It's too much going to see that there's more to Sony TV 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.610
 also has a hexa processor and the elite 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 My grandchild is not talking difficult to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.159
 this business only he does it fix 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.680
 the image is not even any image 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 those internet images only believe 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.700
 this because it is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.079
 I think it's a 3d tv plus a reason to 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 I choose sony nex has the technology 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.189
 3d super resolution I know I know 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.229
 You do not speak English, but it's okay. I'll go. 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.159
 translate, you know when you go to 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.140
 movie theater 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.350
 then you will have the same quality is the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.000
 same feeling in your house is that neither 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.259
 cinema and I know I know it frightens 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.679
 with 3d i know 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.689
 Talk to Tito and then she'll love it. 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.399
 not only because it is because the tv is her 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.000
 also has another incredible subtle feature 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.310
 is the high 3d effect to justice asks calm and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.530
 stay calm the name is difficult but what 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 he does is very simple saw name is 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.790
 complicated but he takes shade 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.959
 This shades the images in 3D is not 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.420
 It will stay just like in your house . 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.530
 neighbor does not know that the image is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.900
 all erased 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.470
 one can not believe the truth was the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.799
 screen 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.760
 I already told you about the screen the screen is led to 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.079
 led the kingdom is serious and do not speak these 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.470
 things just to show what I have in 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.519
 do not show santil knows what 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 means 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.470
 the screen is too thin it weighs little and spends 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.650
 much less energy 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.630
 I'm good here convincing you 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.310
 you can be sure that it will not 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.269
 regret 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.160
 Are you going to watch it? It 's okay. 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:06.190
