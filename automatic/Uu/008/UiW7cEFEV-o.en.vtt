solutions<00:00:03.629> what<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.100> front<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.400> you

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
solutions what you have in front of you

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.730 
solutions what you have in front of you
here<00:00:05.850> are<00:00:06.060> two<00:00:06.450> leather<00:00:06.899> jackets<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.560> want

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
here are two leather jackets and I want

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.930 
here are two leather jackets and I want
to<00:00:07.799> talk<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.460> leather<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.880> you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to talk about the leather that you

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.549 
to talk about the leather that you
commonly<00:00:09.360> find<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.840> leather<00:00:10.050> jackets

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
commonly find on leather jackets

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.789 
commonly find on leather jackets
particularly<00:00:11.130> quality<00:00:12.090> leather<00:00:12.300> jackets<00:00:12.799> so

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
particularly quality leather jackets so

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.490 
particularly quality leather jackets so
the<00:00:14.250> leather<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:15.150> produced<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.020> way<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.379> is

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the leather is produced in a way that is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.779 
the leather is produced in a way that is
different<00:00:17.010> than<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> would<00:00:17.730> normally

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
different than what you would normally

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.000 
different than what you would normally
find<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.690> piece<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> furniture<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> an

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
find on a piece of furniture or in an

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.370 
find on a piece of furniture or in an
automobile<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.880> kinds<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> finishes<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
automobile the kinds of finishes that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
automobile the kinds of finishes that
are<00:00:22.470> used<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.980> jackets<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.730> tend<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> be

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
are used for jackets are tend to be

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
are used for jackets are tend to be
slightly<00:00:24.720> different<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.490> important<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
slightly different and it's important to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.540 
slightly different and it's important to
understand<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> distinction<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.550> what

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
understand that distinction so what

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.250 
understand that distinction so what
we're<00:00:29.699> seeing<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.510> two<00:00:30.570> jackets

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
we're seeing here with these two jackets

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
we're seeing here with these two jackets
is<00:00:31.380> something<00:00:31.740> called<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> nitrocellulose

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is something called a nitrocellulose

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
is something called a nitrocellulose
finish<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> finish<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.920> when

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
finish it's the kind of finish that when

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.530 
finish it's the kind of finish that when
you<00:00:35.160> look<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> sort<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> gives<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.329> this

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you look at it sort of gives you this

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
you look at it sort of gives you this
glistening<00:00:37.200> effect<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.489> new

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
glistening effect or when it was new

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.389 
glistening effect or when it was new
that<00:00:39.660> glistening<00:00:40.200> effect<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> function<00:00:41.219> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that glistening effect is a function of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
that glistening effect is a function of
the<00:00:41.850> way<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:43.200> coats<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.680> applied<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the way the top coats are applied and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.299 
the way the top coats are applied and
the<00:00:44.340> chemistry's<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.000> those<00:00:45.149> top<00:00:45.390> coats<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
the chemistry's of those top coats that

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
the chemistry's of those top coats that
requires<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.489> specific<00:00:48.090> kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.360> chemistry

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
requires a specific kind of chemistry

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
requires a specific kind of chemistry
that<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.110> normally<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> find

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that you normally are not going to find

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
that you normally are not going to find
in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> field<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.809> chemistry<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
in the field this is of chemistry that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.900 
in the field this is of chemistry that
you<00:00:52.530> find<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> tanneries<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> not

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you find in tanneries but not

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
you find in tanneries but not
necessarily<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:55.170> companies<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.829> ours<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
necessarily in companies like ours that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.650 
necessarily in companies like ours that
are<00:00:56.610> involved<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.030> repair<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> restoration

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
are involved in repair and restoration

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.220 
are involved in repair and restoration
and<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.190> consequently<00:00:59.640> when<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:00.809> doing<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and so consequently when we're doing a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.470 
and so consequently when we're doing a
job<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> client<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.480> complaining

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
job where the client is complaining

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
job where the client is complaining
about<00:01:03.660> scuffing<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> thing

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
about scuffing and that kind of thing

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
about scuffing and that kind of thing
for<00:01:06.299> us<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.600> use<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> coloring<00:01:07.350> process<00:01:07.590> we

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
for us to use a coloring process we

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
for us to use a coloring process we
would<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.479> match<00:01:09.720> exactly<00:01:10.409> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
would not be able to match exactly this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.690 
would not be able to match exactly this
glistening<00:01:11.130> effect<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
glistening effect that the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.870 
glistening effect that the
nitrocellulose<00:01:12.270> finish<00:01:12.780> has<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> coming<00:01:14.790> up

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
nitrocellulose finish has so coming up

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520 
nitrocellulose finish has so coming up
with<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.180> alternate<00:01:15.600> strategy<00:01:15.750> says<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
with an alternate strategy says that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.200 
with an alternate strategy says that
what<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.009> end<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.280> doing<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.049> doing<00:01:19.049> some

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
what we would end up doing is doing some

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
what we would end up doing is doing some
darkening<00:01:21.210> effect<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> leather<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
darkening effect on the leather so that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
darkening effect on the leather so that
it<00:01:23.009> darkens<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> scuffing<00:01:24.479> but

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it darkens and that's the scuffing but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
it darkens and that's the scuffing but
it<00:01:24.720> doesn't<00:01:25.080> produce<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.979> glistening

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it doesn't produce that glistening

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
it doesn't produce that glistening
effect<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.509> doesn't<00:01:27.840> require<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
effect and it doesn't require the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830 
effect and it doesn't require the
application<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> color<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.210> apply<00:01:30.540> color

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this you are first of all going to be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.700 
this you are first of all going to be
changing<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> finish<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.500> longer

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
changing the finish you will no longer

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
changing the finish you will no longer
be<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> nitrocellulose<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.060> secondly<00:01:39.810> you'll

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
be a nitrocellulose and secondly you'll

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
be a nitrocellulose and secondly you'll
be<00:01:40.079> changing<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.250> small<00:01:41.610> degree<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
leather feel way the leather feels but
you<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.009> changing<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.610> let<00:01:44.790> me<00:01:44.850> show<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you will be changing so let me show you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.749 
you will be changing so let me show you
an<00:01:45.420> alternate<00:01:46.200> strategy<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.369> alternate

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
an alternate strategy the alternate

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.880 
an alternate strategy the alternate
strategy<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> use<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> chemistry<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
strategy is to use a chemistry that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.639 
strategy is to use a chemistry that
actually<00:01:50.340> has<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.850> high<00:01:51.810> amount<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> solids

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually has some high amount of solids

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.800 
actually has some high amount of solids
in<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.729> allow<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.060> us<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.659> able

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
in it that will allow for us to be able

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.440 
in it that will allow for us to be able
to<00:01:54.990> conceal<00:01:55.680> something<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.119> tiny

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to conceal something like this tiny

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
to conceal something like this tiny
scuff<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.490> we

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
scuff that we have right here so if we

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
scuff that we have right here so if we
can<00:01:59.610> zoom<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.390> stuff<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.899> watch<00:02:01.079> what

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
can zoom in on that stuff and watch what

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
can zoom in on that stuff and watch what
I'm<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
I'm going to do so I'm going to do is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.429 
I'm going to do so I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> apply<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I'm just going to apply a little bit of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
I'm just going to apply a little bit of
this<00:02:04.590> material<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.399> cuff<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> can

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
this material to this cuff and you can

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.169 
this material to this cuff and you can
see<00:02:06.270> how<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.140> soaks<00:02:07.500> into<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> leather

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
see how it soaks into the leather

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.800 
see how it soaks into the leather
basically<00:02:09.179> making<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.720> cuff

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
basically making this cuff

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.199 
basically making this cuff
disappear<00:02:11.350> light<00:02:12.010> buffing<00:02:12.430> action<00:02:12.730> over<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
disappear light buffing action over the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.820 
disappear light buffing action over the
top<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.640> while<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.240> detect<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:17.110> as<00:02:17.319> being

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
top and while I can detect that as being

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.290 
top and while I can detect that as being
an<00:02:18.100> area<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.550> we've<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.880> put<00:02:19.150> some

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
an area that we've just put some

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.760 
an area that we've just put some
material<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.020> because<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.440> doesn't<00:02:20.590> have

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
material on it because it doesn't have

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.410 
material on it because it doesn't have
the<00:02:20.860> same<00:02:21.160> degree<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.490> glisten<00:02:22.060> as<00:02:22.209> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the same degree of glisten as the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.270 
the same degree of glisten as the
surrounding<00:02:22.870> material<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.680> certainly<00:02:24.040> looks

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
surrounding material it certainly looks

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.650 
surrounding material it certainly looks
a<00:02:24.370> whole<00:02:24.520> lot<00:02:24.550> better<00:02:24.940> than<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> did<00:02:25.450> before

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
a whole lot better than it did before

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
a whole lot better than it did before
and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.830> second<00:02:27.220> step<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.610> process

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and then the second step in the process

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120 
and then the second step in the process
is<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.390> need<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.050> put<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.260> protection<00:02:29.800> over<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
is we need to put a protection over the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.390 
is we need to put a protection over the
top<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.420> using<00:02:31.959> our<00:02:32.400> leather

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
top of that and so using our leather

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.910 
top of that and so using our leather
conditioner<00:02:33.790> protector<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:35.560> are<00:02:35.800> able

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
conditioner protector we then are able

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.270 
conditioner protector we then are able
to<00:02:36.480> apply<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.569> protection<00:02:38.230> over<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.800> affected

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to apply a protection over that affected

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.610 
to apply a protection over that affected
area<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:41.470> are<00:02:42.959> bringing<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.350> whole

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
area so that we are bringing this whole

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.490 
area so that we are bringing this whole
area<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.970> leather<00:02:46.209> back<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> state<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
area of the leather back to a state that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.110 
area of the leather back to a state that
has<00:02:47.830> such<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.370> degree<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> protection<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.510> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
has such a degree of protection on it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.190 
has such a degree of protection on it
we're<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> point<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.630> process<00:02:52.750> where<00:02:53.080> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
we're in a point in the process where I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.370 
we're in a point in the process where I
wanted<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.620> show<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:53.950> comparison<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:55.750> arm<00:02:56.080> or

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
wanted to show a comparison one arm or

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.860 
wanted to show a comparison one arm or
one<00:02:56.769> cuff<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.790> jacket<00:02:58.239> compared<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
one cuff of the jacket compared to the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.540 
one cuff of the jacket compared to the
other<00:02:59.050> arm<00:02:59.290> or<00:02:59.500> cuff<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.920> jacket<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.430> we

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
other arm or cuff of the jacket that we

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.780 
other arm or cuff of the jacket that we
haven't<00:03:00.880> done<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:02.280> josh<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.640> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
haven't done and so josh is going to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.270 
haven't done and so josh is going to
zoom<00:03:04.330> down<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.840> take<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.019> look<00:03:05.290> at<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.890> areas

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
zoom down and take a look at the areas

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.559 
zoom down and take a look at the areas
that<00:03:06.400> we've<00:03:06.550> worked<00:03:06.819> in<00:03:06.970> an<00:03:07.060> area<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.480> we

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
that we've worked in an area that we

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.630 
that we've worked in an area that we
haven't<00:03:08.140> worked<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.860> show<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.069> one

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
haven't worked I'm going to show you one

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.390 
haven't worked I'm going to show you one
additional<00:03:10.390> step<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.140> process<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:11.830> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
additional step in the process so this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.309 
additional step in the process so this
arm<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:12.940> can<00:03:13.060> clearly<00:03:13.269> see<00:03:13.390> has<00:03:13.870> been<00:03:14.080> done

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
arm as you can clearly see has been done

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.410 
arm as you can clearly see has been done
this<00:03:14.860> arm<00:03:15.130> hasn't<00:03:15.400> been<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.150> see<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
this arm hasn't been you can see the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.150 
this arm hasn't been you can see the
scuffing<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.049> still<00:03:17.260> exists<00:03:17.620> here<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:18.040> this

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
scuffing that still exists here but this

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.550 
scuffing that still exists here but this
cuffing<00:03:18.549> is<00:03:18.670> far<00:03:18.910> less<00:03:19.090> evident<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:20.320> side

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
cuffing is far less evident on this side

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.740 
cuffing is far less evident on this side
so<00:03:20.799> here's<00:03:21.100> part<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.510> strategies

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
so here's part of one of the strategies

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
so here's part of one of the strategies
we<00:03:23.170> would<00:03:23.320> use<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.650> something<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.250> is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
we would use in something like this is

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.740 
we would use in something like this is
to<00:03:24.459> use<00:03:24.760> something<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:25.180> an<00:03:25.420> artist

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
to use something like an artist

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.530 
to use something like an artist
paintbrush<00:03:26.260> we're<00:03:27.100> not<00:03:27.220> putting<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.239> lot<00:03:28.390> of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
paintbrush we're not putting a lot of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.509 
paintbrush we're not putting a lot of
material<00:03:29.019> down<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.500> what<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.769> are<00:03:29.950> doing<00:03:30.190> is

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
material down but what we are doing is

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.280 
material down but what we are doing is
putting<00:03:30.910> enough<00:03:31.180> material<00:03:31.660> down<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.079> lay<00:03:32.260> down

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
putting enough material down to lay down

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.759 
putting enough material down to lay down
the<00:03:32.680> chafing<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.510> abrasion<00:03:35.470> that

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
the chafing that the abrasion that

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.250 
the chafing that the abrasion that
created<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.430> discoloration<00:03:37.260> represents

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
created that discoloration represents

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.440 
created that discoloration represents
and<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.760> process<00:03:40.209> it's<00:03:40.390> not

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
and so you can see that process it's not

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.110 
and so you can see that process it's not
not<00:03:41.079> difficult<00:03:41.890> it's<00:03:42.070> what's<00:03:42.519> key<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
not difficult it's what's key is the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.900 
not difficult it's what's key is the
correct<00:03:43.480> chemistry's<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.859> be<00:03:45.040> sure<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.609> what

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
correct chemistry's to be sure that what

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.770 
correct chemistry's to be sure that what
we're<00:03:46.090> doing<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.630> coloring<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.609> or<00:03:48.609> coating<00:03:49.540> in

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
we're doing is coloring in or coating in

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
we're doing is coloring in or coating in
the<00:03:50.140> leather<00:03:50.410> that's<00:03:50.739> been<00:03:50.920> offended<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:51.579> not

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
the leather that's been offended but not

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.670 
the leather that's been offended but not
negatively<00:03:52.480> affecting<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.200> way<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.500> leather

negatively affecting the way the leather

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.569 
negatively affecting the way the leather
feels<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:54.940> looks<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.410> all<00:03:56.799> of<00:03:56.980> this<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.280> at<00:03:57.459> the

feels or looks so all of this is at the
intent<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.120> making<00:03:58.269> sure<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:58.660> we<00:03:58.930> maintain

intent of making sure that we maintain
the<00:03:59.680> character<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.549> piece<00:04:00.880> being<00:04:01.840> a

the character of this piece being a
nitro<00:04:02.470> finish<00:04:05.670> when<00:04:06.670> we<00:04:06.790> began<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.269> project

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
nitro finish when we began the project

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.319 
nitro finish when we began the project
we<00:04:08.410> understood<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.670> leather<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.180> we

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
we understood that the leather that we

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.440 
we understood that the leather that we
were<00:04:10.450> dealing<00:04:10.690> with<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.170> it

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
were dealing with is it

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.600 
were dealing with is it
whether<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.050> has<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> nitrocellulose<00:04:13.099> finish

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
whether that has a nitrocellulose finish

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.699 
whether that has a nitrocellulose finish
on<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.940> this<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.660> finish<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.050> allows<00:04:15.470> for<00:04:15.650> a

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
on it this is a finish that allows for a

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.610 
on it this is a finish that allows for a
really<00:04:15.950> soft<00:04:16.190> hand<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:17.540> if<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:17.810> put<00:04:18.049> color<00:04:18.290> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
really soft hand and if we put color and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.819 
really soft hand and if we put color and
an<00:04:18.739> extensive<00:04:19.220> coloring<00:04:19.820> on<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.450> jacket

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
an extensive coloring on this jacket

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.840 
an extensive coloring on this jacket
there's<00:04:21.829> no<00:04:22.040> way<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.340> we<00:04:22.490> would<00:04:22.639> have<00:04:22.700> been

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
there's no way that we would have been

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.450 
there's no way that we would have been
able<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.180> avoid<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.630> stiffening<00:04:24.230> effect<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.860> so

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
able to avoid a stiffening effect and so

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.120 
able to avoid a stiffening effect and so
what<00:04:25.639> we<00:04:25.820> did<00:04:26.030> was<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.660> process<00:04:27.230> that<00:04:27.500> had<00:04:27.979> us

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
what we did was a process that had us

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.530 
what we did was a process that had us
focus<00:04:28.550> on<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.970> frayed<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:31.540> chafed

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
focus on the frayed and and and chafed

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.530 
focus on the frayed and and and chafed
areas<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.620> scuffed<00:04:34.010> areas<00:04:34.370> only<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.120> we<00:04:35.330> used

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
areas and scuffed areas only and we used

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.629 
areas and scuffed areas only and we used
a<00:04:35.690> technique<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.290> did<00:04:36.650> not<00:04:36.860> include<00:04:37.190> any

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
a technique that did not include any

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.940 
a technique that did not include any
color<00:04:38.060> but<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:38.840> can<00:04:39.110> see<00:04:39.350> when<00:04:39.590> we<00:04:39.680> look<00:04:39.860> at

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
color but you can see when we look at

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.469 
color but you can see when we look at
the<00:04:40.100> ends<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.580> arms<00:04:40.610> where<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.180> where

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
the ends of the arms where the where

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.260 
the ends of the arms where the where
that<00:04:41.710> scuffing<00:04:42.710> was<00:04:42.889> there<00:04:43.610> was<00:04:43.729> significant

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
that scuffing was there was significant

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.940 
that scuffing was there was significant
scuffing<00:04:44.690> here<00:04:45.020> there<00:04:45.260> was<00:04:45.410> tape<00:04:45.710> residue

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
scuffing here there was tape residue

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.719 
scuffing here there was tape residue
from<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.610> from<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.090> nametag<00:04:47.690> here<00:04:48.550> there<00:04:49.550> was<00:04:49.700> a

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
from it from a nametag here there was a

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.530 
from it from a nametag here there was a
lot<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.030> scuffing<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:51.940> color<00:04:52.940> loss<00:04:53.210> along

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
lot of scuffing and color loss along

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.780 
lot of scuffing and color loss along
this<00:04:53.750> edge<00:04:53.990> here<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.710> of<00:04:55.220> course<00:04:55.460> all<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.700> way

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
this edge here and of course all the way

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.340 
this edge here and of course all the way
around<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.120> bottom<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.690> classic<00:04:57.139> place

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
around the bottom and the classic place

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.469 
around the bottom and the classic place
is<00:04:57.530> where<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.830> would<00:04:57.919> actually<00:04:58.130> see<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:59.300> on

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
is where you would actually see this on

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.810 
is where you would actually see this on
a<00:04:59.510> jacket<00:05:00.020> like<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.340> all<00:05:01.340> of<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.639> high

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
a jacket like this all of the high

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.140 
a jacket like this all of the high
points<00:05:02.120> along<00:05:02.960> where<00:05:03.290> there<00:05:03.470> are<00:05:03.620> seams<00:05:04.150> of

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
points along where there are seams of

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.390 
points along where there are seams of
course<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.630> across<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.260> shoulder<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.830> you

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
course the across the shoulder and you

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.600 
course the across the shoulder and you
can<00:05:07.610> see<00:05:07.820> that<00:05:08.150> we<00:05:08.870> were<00:05:08.960> able<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.380> bring<00:05:10.370> this

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
can see that we were able to bring this

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.719 
can see that we were able to bring this
jacket<00:05:11.060> back<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.570> very<00:05:11.840> much<00:05:12.080> like<00:05:12.320> new<00:05:12.729> but

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
jacket back to very much like new but

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.850 
jacket back to very much like new but
also<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.479> most<00:05:14.660> important<00:05:15.169> thing<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.560> we<00:05:15.680> did

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
also the most important thing is we did

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.670 
also the most important thing is we did
not<00:05:15.889> falter<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.940> way<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.210> leather<00:05:17.389> feels<00:05:17.810> so

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
not falter the way the leather feels so

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.830 
not falter the way the leather feels so
if<00:05:19.580> you'd<00:05:19.760> like<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.060> know<00:05:20.180> more<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:20.780> more

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
if you'd like to know more and more

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.629 
if you'd like to know more and more
about<00:05:21.139> this<00:05:21.380> technique<00:05:21.889> or<00:05:22.160> learn<00:05:22.400> more<00:05:22.460> about
