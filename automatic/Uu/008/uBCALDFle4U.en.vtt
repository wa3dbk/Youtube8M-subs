00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.740
 for this tablet blog.de in this video 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.920
 we want the samsung galaxy note pro 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.589
 12.2 unpack so the biggest variant 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.129
 from the short version of the galaxy note 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.740
 series 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.230
 and here we start with the price 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.600
 starts at 799 euro that is the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.190
 recommended retail price typical 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.060
 samsung is likely to be quite fast 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.040
 fall 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.530
 we now have the place which the tablet 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.619
 He briefly to the side and look at what 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.120
 is still in the box we have 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 Here is a quick start guide 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.359
 also the warranty card with buy then 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:44.019
 we have a usb 3.0 to normal usb 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.719
 3.0 port to micro usb 3.0 usb 3.0 like 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.589
 at the gem then of course that 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.199
 power supply and replacement heads for the stylus 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.269
 will look at the otherwise equal more 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.519
 reasonable does not hide in the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.260
 packaging we come directly to 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.460
 samsung galaxy note 12.24 free that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.760
 First of the police

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.590
 display with a resolution of 2560 x 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.210
 1600 pixels on 12 212 we go 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 make the device around we have here 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.170
 above a webcam then down the three 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.730
 typical samsung buttons if we go then 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 we have to go to the side 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.060
 Headset then a speaker 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.350
 we have nothing downstairs 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.970
 this page we have a sim 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.610
 card slot in the here is the lte 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.730
 version sitting next to the micro sd cards 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.160
 slot the micro usb 3.0 connection 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.230
 another speaker and the slot 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.150
 for the stylus is the same stylus 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.950
 which we also need in the other appliances 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.470
 know 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.420
 then we have another 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.310
 infrared sensor a microphone a 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.710
 volume thunderstorm next to and one 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.990
 power button here is a very small one 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.420
 chick sticker because that's it anyway 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.149
 version with the snapdragon 800 the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.970
 wlan variant had mexico processor 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.160
 from samsung on the back we see 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.819
 the same leather surface we use 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.770
 even from the small nothin will turnovers 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.280
 another 8 megapixel camera with one 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.890
 Led lightning together with the snapdragon 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.900
 800 processor sit in it 3 gb 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.420
 RAM and then different 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.209
 memory option i mean from 16 gb to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
 32gb 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 here we see android 4.4 kitkat 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.739
 that runs on the emergency program times 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.620
 Quickly in the attitude around us 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.510
 to look 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.370
 so that actually android 4.4 point 2 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.569
 kit kat and that she is one of the first 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.040
 tablets that comes with kitkat 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.799
 As far as the software is concerned here 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.170
 samsung in comparison to those on the ifa 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.370
 featured not some devices 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.440
 we have still changed here 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.350
 touchwiz on it now, however 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.690
 with the so-called magazine newey and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.519
 there you will eventually find 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 News you can from the twitter and 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.100
 facebook feed quite a few here 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.239
 Add 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.070
 I always think it a bit 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.820
 confusing some if it is 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.860
 maybe like 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.170
 At the moment , that seems pretty stupid 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120
 but sometimes july was also on 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.130
 Maybe samsung will do that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.140
 updates still improve 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.959
 Here you can quickly get the chrome 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.290
 open browser and a website 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.590
 Call to see if all this is here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.020
 works well and I think that is 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.310
 also the case 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.910
 then we can have a few more 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.820
 For example, look at touches features 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.040
 multitasking the multi window 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.000
 feature so we can have two or more 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.490
 extremely open each other 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.830
 I now have the browser with me 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.200
 We make a word document easy 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.410
 my new about document and then you can 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.700
 we show what you have here 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.250
 for example, what can do pretty much 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.950
 Practical is if you are here at all 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.930
 you can see content pull and drop 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.820
 if we can push on it we can 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.670
 for example, a picture from the browser 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.110
 in the word-document pack and that 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.010
 pretty handy a feature that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 we do not have on other tablets so 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.830
 then of course we have the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:25.280
 classic air command aps commands the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.340
 we already know about note 3 and not 10.1 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.380
 2014 edition and what ultimately 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.060
 These are also the biggest new ones 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.220
 features of course we still have s 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.500
 but then there was in comparison to 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.100
 not much previous version 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.740
 done 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.520
