00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.940
 and unfortunately a lot 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 a nasty surprise that now don't make me laugh

 that the answer on the left side of the case 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.140
 m 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.990
 I must 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 try to fix it somehow 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.299
 I don't even know how long it takes me to do it 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.190
 so I have to come up with something here 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.740
 in short, low cost flights 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.949
 in this case it is a problem for nothing 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.920

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.129
 in the space of a couple of days I can't do that 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.279
 why this problem occurred and then touches 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.989
 wait and see what you can do 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:13.859
 to solve 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.809
 how to solve the problem

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.919
 with the shipper 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.250
 both in Italy and here 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.300
 so it won't be an easy job it will be a nice break of balls 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.889
 hopefully 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.789
 things are resolved more than anything else but surely it will take a while 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.409
 time e 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.789

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.519
 Facebook 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.239
 therefore in any case silicone silicone must be welded. colored should come out a 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:27.550
 rai place this plate we say as the background of the bag 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.809

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 everything in it 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.389
