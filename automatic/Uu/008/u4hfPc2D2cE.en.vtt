these drag these hands across because

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.380

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
clockwise fashion so hand one would

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.739 
clockwise fashion so hand one would
actually<00:00:44.030> be<00:00:44.089> on<00:00:44.179> the<00:00:44.269> right<00:00:44.420> hand<00:00:44.629> side

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
doesn't really do anything but if you

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.990 
doesn't really do anything but if you
find<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.469> good<00:01:27.649> live<00:01:27.920> dealer<00:01:28.310> casino<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.880> you

dealer<00:01:30.799> online<00:01:31.280> casinos<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.270> bet365<00:01:32.899> has

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
dealer online casinos I think bet365 has

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.740 
dealer online casinos I think bet365 has
one<00:01:33.530> actually<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.759> can<00:01:34.969> turn<00:01:35.329> on<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.539> card

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
one actually you can turn on the card

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.749 
one actually you can turn on the card
counting<00:01:36.049> there<00:01:36.229> they<00:01:36.469> use<00:01:36.619> an<00:01:36.770> 8x<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.430> you'd

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
counting there they use an 8x so you'd

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.399 
counting there they use an 8x so you'd
have<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.030> select<00:01:38.420> eight<00:01:38.689> decks<00:01:38.930> for<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.229> card

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
have to select eight decks for the card

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.550 
have to select eight decks for the card
counting<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.920> properly<00:01:40.340> adjust<00:01:40.549> for<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.560> okay

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
counting to properly adjust for it okay

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.789 
counting to properly adjust for it okay
and<00:01:42.799> naturally<00:01:43.549> I<00:01:43.960> added<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.079> adjust<00:01:45.530> wager

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
and naturally I added the adjust wager

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.980 
and naturally I added the adjust wager
so<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.270> will<00:01:47.450> automatically

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so that so that it will automatically

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.740 
so that so that it will automatically
change<00:01:48.109> your<00:01:48.560> wager<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.210> count<00:01:50.509> of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
change your wager to what the count of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.499 
change your wager to what the count of
the<00:01:50.780> cards<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.640> okay<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:52.939> have<00:01:52.969> wind<00:01:53.270> limit

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
the cards is okay so we have wind limit

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.230 
the cards is okay so we have wind limit
right<00:01:54.439> now<00:01:54.469> it's<00:01:54.920> default<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:55.520> 15<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.090> I've

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
right now it's default is 15 but I've

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.819 
right now it's default is 15 but I've
