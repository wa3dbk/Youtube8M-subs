00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.770
 hello welcome once again to burgay 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.410
 ming today we have done with the salman z 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.840
 mgm 4 better known as the mouse 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.180
 you had been asking us 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.849
 enough for him and today we finally have it 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.279
 here to start I have to tell you that 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.130
 it is quite impressive for its 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.710
 unique mechanical aesthetics really that 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.170
 it seems the terminator of the mice to me 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.079
 it has surprised me I have to tell you 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.329
 also that it is 100% customizable and 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.780
 It is designed especially for gaming 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.690
 Well, let's see it in detail, well, let's go 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 to take a look first at the packaging 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.220
 We see an image of the product with its 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.050
 business name underneath has a lid 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.450
 that we can open to see in his 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.630
 inside the us and also three 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.610
 photos with the outline of the buttons in 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.780
 all sides have the name 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.180
 of the model the mg mg 4 and finally 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.310
 behind we find a text with its 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 technical characteristics in several 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 Languages 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 that's not spectacular and it's not about 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 an empty design but everything has a 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.060
 function to start is a mouse to use 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.190
 ambidextrous which is to be grateful for 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
 laterals and the back of the mouse 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.979
 they are regulated with this small allen key 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 hidden here back just take it out and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.950
 adjust the part that we need from this 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.950
 way 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.340
 this kind of exhibitor so unusual to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.830
 here it is quite aesthetic but its 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.190
 objective is that we can adapt the weight 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 according to our needs he does not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.830
 you weigh 135 grams but it includes 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.750
 Inside 6 weights of 35 grams each 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.430
 Apart it includes a small metal box 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.430
 in which to keep the weights 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.170
 one of the things that you will like the most 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.690
 is your powerful laser down 9.800 with a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.940
 pool in king of 1000 hertz these 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.580
 ensure maximum precision and speed 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.940
 of response with these characteristics 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.250
 I assure you that you will be much faster 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.650
 that your rivals something that is 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.930
 obvious is that a gaming mouse needs 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 several buttons so that all the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.990
 functions are very accessible 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.840
 in this case the salt mancheta mgm 4 has 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.600
 10 fully configurable through 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.090
 your software in addition on the top 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100
 we found a led indicator where 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.410
 we can see the speed of the pepe 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.420
 and as we change it from 800 cpi to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.000
 8,200 divided into four stages 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.580
 Lastly, tell them that it includes a 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.210
 very simple and intuitive software with 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.100
 advanced configuration options 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.080
 Well, it seems to you that the US 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.660
 it is not just any mouse but 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.790
 authentic combat weapon with a design 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 impeccable 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.950
 also thanks to its braided cable and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.200
 omron salma technology ensures us 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.269
 a lifespan of more than 5 million 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.969
 clicks so you're going to have a mouse to 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.650
 Long as I hope you liked it and 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.480
