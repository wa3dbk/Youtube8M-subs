this<00:06:02.449> one<00:06:02.659> has<00:06:02.689> a<00:06:02.930> lot<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.259> hardware<00:06:03.919> also<00:06:04.610> but

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:04.939 
this one has a lot of hardware also but

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:09.579 
this one has a lot of hardware also but
less<00:06:05.360> than<00:06:05.719> a<00:06:06.610> less<00:06:07.610> than<00:06:07.639> this<00:06:08.120> one<00:06:08.509> so<00:06:08.990> it's

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
less than a less than this one so it's

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:16.839 
less than a less than this one so it's
not<00:06:10.189> as<00:06:10.550> heavy<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:14.800> for<00:06:15.800> some<00:06:15.979> reason<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.610> feel

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
not as heavy and for some reason I feel

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.429 
not as heavy and for some reason I feel
