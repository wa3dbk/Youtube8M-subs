00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 bad culture still persists by 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.950
 of the drivers of vehicles that by 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.780
 some reason they run over animals like 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 dogs or cats who die on the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 artery to get off the vehicle and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 put aside the animal or call the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090
 appropriate dependence to lift the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 can or feline as it happened in the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.109
 5th street with Rafael Melgar where the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.910
 cars passed over the cat without 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 that someone had the conscience or the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.449
 responsibility as a citizen of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.250
 do it aside until a person 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.140
 of the third age that circulated in his 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 bicycle was willing to make a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.540
 side to the animal and look when it came out does 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 10 minutes I saw the one kitten very 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 expected the far away hey I thought it's a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 dead kitten was against the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 sidewalk and now it's in the middle of the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.650
 street he was not alone and I do not think 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.079
 I do not think all of them and I asked for a brake 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.589
 an animal does not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 we still need to work on that 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.269
 then it can also be that we have 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 too cats and cats 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.990
 on this island when people are going to go that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.049
 it comes free to them to make their 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.259
 animals are sterilized are we going to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 have fewer problems and the animals one 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.760
 better life, yes, because they look bad 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.010
 look ugly 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.920
 where is it possible to cause the govern 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.130
 and you really have to call someone 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.140
 if he was picked up and run over 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.420
 with at least lift them up 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.149
 put passed they moved them more to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 I do not remember there because my friend in 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.759
 what went out if he was there and I what 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.970
 passed a car did not even made of 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.310
 slow down and see you know I think to say what 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.000
 less would it be then to raise it not to leave 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.460
 who see other vehicles and follow them 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.110
 mistreating not like that is and above all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.880
 we know that they are going to be careful before 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.360
 run over them but if bad luck 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520
 already 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.940
 I run over, so put aside 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 somewhere that does not let you throw the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.990
 street with images of charly from usa 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.860
 reported for promovision 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.860
 the fridge
