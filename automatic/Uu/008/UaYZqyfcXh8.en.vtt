00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
really simple it's something different

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.460 
really simple it's something different
for<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.000> style<00:03:26.359> line<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> lot<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.079> people<00:03:27.290> don't

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
for the style line a lot of people don't

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.930 
for the style line a lot of people don't
like<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.650> because<00:03:27.889> it's<00:03:28.250> really<00:03:28.310> simple<00:03:28.819> it's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
like it because it's really simple it's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.599 
like it because it's really simple it's
not<00:03:29.060> as<00:03:29.329> detailed<00:03:29.630> as<00:03:29.989> older<00:03:30.920> style<00:03:31.250> line<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.549> I

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
not as detailed as older style line so I

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.430 
not as detailed as older style line so I
guess<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.150> like<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.299> more<00:03:32.600> casual<00:03:33.049> kind<00:03:33.290> of

guess this is like a more casual kind of

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.379 
guess this is like a more casual kind of
look<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.859> not<00:03:34.040> as<00:03:34.250> luxurious<00:03:34.489> as<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.239> other

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
look and not as luxurious as the other

disappointing<00:04:46.259> I<00:04:46.650> thought<00:04:46.860> they<00:04:47.220> were<00:04:47.310> gonna

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
disappointing I thought they were gonna

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.159 
disappointing I thought they were gonna
be<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.669> live<00:04:48.030> dolls<00:04:48.270> up<00:04:48.509> there<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.810> can<00:04:48.990> move

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
be like live dolls up there you can move

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.719 
be like live dolls up there you can move
them<00:04:49.320> from<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> side<00:04:49.860> or<00:04:49.889> like<00:04:50.220> Monster<00:04:50.580> High

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
them from the side or like Monster High

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.480 
them from the side or like Monster High
dolls<00:04:50.910> but<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.620> guess<00:04:52.620> not

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
dolls but I guess not

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.110 
dolls but I guess not
nothing<00:04:54.180> can<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.449> perfect<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:56.280> overall<00:04:56.760> I

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
nothing can be perfect but overall I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.360 
nothing can be perfect but overall I
