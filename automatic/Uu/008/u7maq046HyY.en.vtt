00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
event that's coming up next month I have

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.870 
event that's coming up next month I have
been<00:00:12.509> looking<00:00:13.259> at<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> past<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.309> world<00:00:14.670> events

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
been looking at the past on world events

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.529 
been looking at the past on world events
and<00:00:15.470> also<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.949> damage<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.490> last<00:00:17.730> year<00:00:18.270> I

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and also the damage from last year I

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.990 
and also the damage from last year I
have<00:00:19.320> yet<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> damage<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.760> year

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
have yet to get the damage for this year

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.060 
have yet to get the damage for this year
so<00:00:21.330> that's<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.260> where<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.680> talking

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so that's probably where I'm not talking

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
so that's probably where I'm not talking
so<00:00:23.189> much<00:00:23.340> about<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.930> seems<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.380> in

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
so much about it but it seems like in

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.130 
so much about it but it seems like in
sectors<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> heroes<00:00:27.199> will<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> tool<00:00:28.970> on

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
sectors and heroes will be the tool on

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.069 
sectors and heroes will be the tool on
favorite<00:00:31.140> decks<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.679> their<00:00:32.489> vet<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.079> then

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
favorite decks in their vet and then

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
favorite decks in their vet and then
followed<00:00:34.620> by<00:00:34.649> dong<00:00:35.309> clothes<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.880> her<00:00:35.969> addicts

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
followed by dong clothes and her addicts

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.240 
followed by dong clothes and her addicts
and<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.120> should<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.260> wind<00:00:40.710> ups<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and then I should see some wind ups here

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.150 
and then I should see some wind ups here
and<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.020> should<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.530> some<00:00:43.860> type<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and there and I should see some type of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.330 
and there and I should see some type of
Dragon<00:00:44.969> built<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.980> personally<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Dragon built I personally think that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
Dragon built I personally think that
dragons<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.180> still<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> good<00:00:48.690> deck<00:00:48.930> even

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
dragons are still a good deck even

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.250 
dragons are still a good deck even
though<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:49.800> lost<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.309> arts<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:51.239> pretty<00:00:52.110> sure

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
though they lost on arts I'm pretty sure

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
though they lost on arts I'm pretty sure
there's<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.590> more<00:00:53.059> dragons<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.300> put<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there's some more dragons you can put in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
there's some more dragons you can put in
instead<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> tour<00:00:55.260> guides<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.239> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
instead of the tour guides and I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
instead of the tour guides and I
probably<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.530> back<00:00:58.739> three<00:00:58.920> DD

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
probably would just make back three DD

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
probably would just make back three DD
close<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> still<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.680> testing

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
close but still in all that's testing

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
close but still in all that's testing
and<00:01:02.340> testing<00:01:02.489> needs<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and testing needs to be done with the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
and testing needs to be done with the
three<00:01:03.690> DD<00:01:03.930> crows<00:01:04.170> I've<00:01:04.680> been<00:01:04.920> testing<00:01:05.339> two<00:01:05.519> in
