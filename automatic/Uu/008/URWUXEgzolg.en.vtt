00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hi to all the Venetian boys that alone 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.640
 aim so we will do a fashion today 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.620
 day 1 point 7.10 boys a lot 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.050
 interesting and very simple for the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 halo lovers this is the fashion on purpose 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.920
 for them guys this fashion goes by 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 add all halo payments 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.930
 more way pon weapons and if I am not mistaken also a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.400
 means of transport that I do not see now 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.930
 I probably didn't put it on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 wall but I'll show you by hand 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.150
 then guys this fashion and it all starts 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 from a wonderful material their hours that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.529
 It is this guy that you see in front of me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 can safely cook you can 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 derive the law wing or three you will use for 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.040
 all crafting then how it works 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.660
 first of all we have to create the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 spartan armor boys like seacraft a 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.750
 sparta in the metal ingot spartan ces 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 plate thus made like the baskets 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.340
 normal like normal pants 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.590
 only with the halo ingots ok 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.300
 to make the other armor will suffice 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 only now do I only see it 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.250
 from the helmets add the specific color 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.040
 to make the red one and the red rosÃ© for 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 make that green hill line come on to do 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.740
 the blue spartan the cyan dai chan come on 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.850
 ok guys and could do armor 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 colored in this case I am 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 wearing the red one then they will be seen 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.159
 everyone is like that but with a different color 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.780
 ok then we have a little armor 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.030
 more powerful than I know is more 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.159
 powerful we all look a little bit 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.250
 more or less the same give a little this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.470
 is the covenant covenant guys is the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 match is made with how the run piece is made 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.320
 however, as normal armor though 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 as the physias that were created from colas 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 and bridge road then to an armor a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.560
 a little bit cooler and even a little bit more 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
 expensive because they actually have 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.329
 these materials from nevertheless there 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 always wants a little bit at the beginning ok yes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.659
 see in this way 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 look at that particular guys 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.579
 let's go to arms then what gives us 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 as a weapon first of all the thing more 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.170
 beautiful of the game the boys energy sword 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.790
 a beautiful sword scratches like one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.880
 normal sword two swallows him on a 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.649
 stick and you have the texture and the sword 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 then we have a beautiful to jump 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.250
 this will surely go with jammo 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.660
 now we'll see it's a gun look 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.970
 very fast and also does damage 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.460
 quite big is done with halloween 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.200
 got and iron gunpowder or else you go 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.340
 only with halloween got of gunpowder 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.630
 so i do n't know why they put of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.650
 crafting an easier one more 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.720
 hard 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.300
 then we have the beats done with 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.490
 4 long so it should be more 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.440
 powerful in damage a glass and a gunpowder 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.209
 it's also shoot with bullets 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.209
 normal 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.550
 ok then we have the thing a little ounce of 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.680
 this fashion that rocket launcher e 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.420
 Racket boys and launcher gets scratched in 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.330
 in this way the two swallows 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.530
 gunpowder bom bom bom rightly 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.020
 for this he will go with his bullets 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.540
 now let's see what then 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.820
 what else adds grenades to 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.090
 fragmentation let's take a little what happens to 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 it's not so powerful I thought worse 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.330
 ok as they treat 3456 of irone one of 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 nt the damage is little however they can be 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 launch at a certain known distance either 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.810
 a little bit particularly distant 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.390
 arrive is ok 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.090
 then we call it that would be it 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.370
 ammunition scratches with four 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.680
 gold and a gunpowder well does well 15 per 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.959
 all the guns and then we have these 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.709
 two type upgrades the other packs that 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.239
 it is done with bull and gold apple and active 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.820
 camouflage that should first mind 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.470
 sending us to Celt is now out of the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.660
 creative should get me to eat a 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.890
 no because virtually these 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.590
 power ups can be taken 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.390
 only at little known life do you wait for 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.970
 madhia a little active camouflage no not me 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.980
 it does activate the camouflage care me 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.799
 gave it and gave me instant high 0 16 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.989
 so but instantly taken care of this 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.340
 instead there is no camouflage 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.320
 something wrong 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.680
 then we go to see grafting we have 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.680
 said that was with ok wool 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.799
 this is the nike old apple they look like 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.620
 said it is a golden carrot a ferment 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.540
 spider you have a and herbert and a spartan 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.859
 baskets probably us eskandari 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.689
 camouflage because I don't have armor 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.870
 fit we see things I put myself with the 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.660
 spartan has been trying for a while 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.240
 bucket plagiarism works does not work 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.770
 cool 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.630
 so there is a camouflage of not working 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.830
 surely it will be activated in another 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.669
 so we don't know 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.580
 then let's see why it doesn't 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.580
 turn the screen ok perfect that 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.389
 then keys will be caught then 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.220
 what else can we do there is a 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.090
 another little object that I didn't put in 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.530
 that combination of things on the wall e 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.039
 now I'll show you right away that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.780
 I find it ok in the snail we have it 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.970
 the other stuff we can handle 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.699
 only one thing will remain to be seen 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.740
 the mundus boys naming usa is nothing else 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.660
 that one equipped a kind of way 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.370
 precisely djalo that is made with halo 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.449
 ingot and 2 goals 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:13.500
 here it is, guys madonna is ugly 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:15.229
 looks like a boat that can walk 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.340
 on earth 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.650
 mace could put a texture and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.510
 at least grandfather made a boat but come on 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.639
 however the very cool and the same comfortable 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.990
 to move on land 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.720
 from what I know there should be 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.580
 also two enemies then on the kraft 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.460
 we should also find two spiner I don't 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.830
 I see them surely I find them here spam 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.560
 let's see a bit then let's see a bit 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.240
 cells the it and the grunt that you are the two 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.370
 mob that adds this mod 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.539
 here the elite mazza boasts life and the grunt 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.820
 yet he is not that good at it 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.000
 then I'd say try to get me 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.580
 that bleed I threw before and 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.740
 beat them with malice then recreational 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.449
 to see how he does but ok me 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.190
 immediately attacked this hyper-fast 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.780
 they are not doing me harm then 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.860
 probably or they do with the damage 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.659
 or this armor really is 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.030
 who today is only able to kill them 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.800
 both though they really have a lot 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.000
 life guys strangely surely for 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.110
 the armor I wear that is a lot 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.550
 powerful 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.800
 ok guys that will be fashion is one 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.360
