the<00:01:18.820> towers<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.420> he<00:01:19.570> needs<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.020> order<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.380> get

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
the towers that he needs in order to get

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.630 
the towers that he needs in order to get
full<00:01:20.710> control<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.130> he<00:01:21.189> said<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.369> there's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
full control and he said that there's

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.420 
full control and he said that there's
three<00:01:21.880> total<00:01:22.240> towers<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:23.259> there's<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:24.189> one

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
three total towers and there's a the one

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.249 
three total towers and there's a the one
that's<00:01:24.670> on<00:01:24.759> transit<00:01:25.210> this<00:01:25.360> one<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.750> then<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
that's on transit this one and then the

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.020 
that's on transit this one and then the
next<00:01:26.290> one<00:01:26.619> I<00:01:26.680> think<00:01:26.799> is<00:01:27.009> going<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.490> Paris

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
next one I think is going to be on Paris

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.060 
next one I think is going to be on Paris
because<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.600> have<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.840> Eiffel<00:01:29.200> Tower<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:29.920> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
because you have the Eiffel Tower it's a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.649 
because you have the Eiffel Tower it's a
third<00:01:30.310> tower<00:01:30.549> he<00:01:30.850> probably<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.329> use<00:01:31.509> that

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
third tower he probably can use that

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.960 
third tower he probably can use that
again<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.140> try<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.350> get<00:01:32.470> controls<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
again to try to get controls and the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.249 
again to try to get controls and the
reason<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.270> I'm<00:01:34.450> saying<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.869> because<00:01:34.899> I

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
reason that I'm saying this is because I

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.260 
reason that I'm saying this is because I
came<00:01:35.470> across<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:36.040> very<00:01:36.399> interesting<00:01:36.969> article

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
came across a very interesting article

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.020 
came across a very interesting article
and<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:38.770> gonna<00:01:38.920> link<00:01:39.219> that<00:01:39.399> on<00:01:39.579> a<00:01:39.610> description

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030

that but I don't think it's that I think
it's<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.510> door<00:03:38.810> handle<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.790> Paris<00:03:41.510> during

this time where were the catacombs there
were<00:03:43.760> metal<00:03:44.209> doors<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:45.350> were<00:03:45.680> locked<00:03:46.070> with

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
were metal doors that were locked with

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.120 
were metal doors that were locked with
these<00:03:46.880> kind<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.269> weird<00:03:47.570> circular<00:03:48.320> handles

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
these kind of weird circular handles

kind of like the ones you see in a
submarine<00:03:50.480> i'm<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.870> show<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.019> picture<00:03:51.290> of

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
submarine i'm going to show a picture of

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
what it looks like these actual doors

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.970 
what it looks like these actual doors
that<00:03:53.600> are<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.959> d<00:03:54.080> catacombs<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.650> are<00:03:54.830> in

that are in d catacombs that are in
Paris<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.910> can<00:03:56.090> see<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.299> picture<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.660> looks

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
Paris you can see the picture it looks

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.259 
Paris you can see the picture it looks
similar<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.830> if<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.850> look<00:03:59.090> I'm

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
similar to that and if you look I'm

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.850 
similar to that and if you look I'm
going<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.450> put<00:03:59.600> that<00:03:59.630> leak<00:04:00.019> bridging<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.650> gap

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
going to put that leak bridging the gap

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.229 
going to put that leak bridging the gap
picture<00:04:01.220> now<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.519> guys<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.910> see<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.150> on

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
picture now you guys can see it on

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.210 
picture now you guys can see it on
screen<00:04:02.269> as<00:04:02.600> well<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.989> think<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.890> kind<00:04:04.070> of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
screen as well I think this kind of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.979 
screen as well I think this kind of
verifies<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:05.090> might<00:04:05.330> be<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> real<00:04:05.780> map

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
verifies that this might be a real map

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.810 
verifies that this might be a real map
i'm<00:04:06.140> not<00:04:06.290> saying<00:04:06.680> completely<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.430> confirmed

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
i'm not saying completely it's confirmed

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.550 
i'm not saying completely it's confirmed
so<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.540> would<00:04:08.660> be<00:04:08.720> stupid<00:04:08.959> i'm<00:04:09.230> saying<00:04:09.470> that

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
so that would be stupid i'm saying that

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.710 
so that would be stupid i'm saying that
it's<00:04:09.680> completely<00:04:10.100> possible<00:04:10.549> though<00:04:11.150> because

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
it's completely possible though because

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.060 
it's completely possible though because
if<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:11.989> look<00:04:12.140> at<00:04:12.230> this<00:04:12.320> if<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.620> look<00:04:12.769> at<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
if you look at this if you look at the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.640 
if you look at this if you look at the
at<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.730> leak<00:04:14.360> loading<00:04:14.840> screen<00:04:15.170> you're<00:04:15.320> seeing

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
at the leak loading screen you're seeing

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.650 
at the leak loading screen you're seeing
that<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.340> kind<00:04:16.669> of<00:04:16.729> looks<00:04:16.970> like<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.510> it's
