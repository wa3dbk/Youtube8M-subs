00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 very under the influence of the last ten 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.540
 15 20 minutes and away from the road from yes 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 that's one thing i might do 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.049
 think about it somehow brings this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 goes on at all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.810
 under the bushel 9 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.750
 I believe that I experienced quite different things 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 prepare if one or the other times 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.770
 I had to say that this way 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 and the doctor can be that is one 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.669
 either sick and from my side in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
 some form of questioning 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.910
 ask that we make errors that wants 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.360
 I play well that's one thing 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.830
 but what goes on here I think 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.600
 that's another thing they can do 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.340
 Judged here as well , he says yes 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.030
 I'm not the one who always says 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.280
 I question now 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 have a phase that is not good then 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 before 4 after almost four years 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.769
 worked at a level that was good 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 there also no need to ask you 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.880
 now change what's gone need there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.720
 we question ourselves in a new one 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 but the whole finds the switch 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 potsdam at the beginning of september won the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.110
 was not an idea it is not 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.350
 Well done now to the present 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 seems too little but even to the wm 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.590
 leads only 1 0 won at home 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 before new 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.829
 I think that's no excuse 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.600
 but sometimes it goes a bit too 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.920
 far, we are always always 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.719
 those with us will be very happy 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.439
 detailed and everything right under the 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.329
 taken a magnifying glass 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.890
 but we do not do that until 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 comparison with other competitors yes 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 we do not play well so we I deliver 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.189
 from none of us that in any 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 question throw in the scale and in 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.340
 Some form tells somebody how 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.569
 visited great 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.310
 I already have the feeling that we are 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.300
 another now 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.670
 we have against velbert as a fashionable word 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.320
 also the actual over-team 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 those will probably be back 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.920
 is sovereign in us is always 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.920
 luck and therefore 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.690
 Of course it depends on where machines 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.910
 would have been the first one would have been 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.670
 the procedure, but you became that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.830
 So I would always say so 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.420
 it's about what do we deliver 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.280
 We are currently not at a high level 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 from that I understand all this 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 arguments i understand the displeasure 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.520
 understand all the dissatisfaction 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.770
 the expectation is that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.660
 yourself 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.569
 to this level we meanwhile 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.210
 as sure 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.890
 to slander in a purely personal and 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.010
 who of the ju believed that he was the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 Team help 22 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.790
 but the weather helped but it works 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.640
 just about any label needs one 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.960
 or more 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.310
 You must be in the front courses 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.240
 make it so it could not make it again 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 briefly make the sun over your ahead 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.910
 we are convinced that the troupe is enough 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.410
 You can get quality from all three times 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.240
 nesting can be the company 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.490
 put in other form yes absolutely 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.540
 what am I sure he was not the one 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.860
 boys in training, I see that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.270
 see each other and I have others 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.800
 I have experienced different situations 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 that's why I'm missing 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.070
 convinced 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.130
 revier sport
