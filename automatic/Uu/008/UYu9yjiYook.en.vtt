00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
because it was really starting to look

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.330 
because it was really starting to look
frizzy<00:03:09.120> again<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.380> sprayed<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.950> just

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
frizzy again and then I sprayed it just

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
to smooth it out a little bit more and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.199 
to smooth it out a little bit more and
brushed<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:16.140> bit<00:03:16.700> very<00:03:17.700> very<00:03:17.940> gently

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
brushed it a little bit very very gently

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.010 
brushed it a little bit very very gently
and<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:19.070> shaped<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.280> back<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.510> its<00:03:21.660> form
