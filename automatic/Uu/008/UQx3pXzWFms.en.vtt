00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.980
 so people is the video below 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.780
 not for a spectator without a good one 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.260
 pain resistance allowed because I was 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.470
 recently I was in the fitness club fellbach 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 there is always such a back 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 training courses ftz courses and powerless 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.679
 also just as you can see in the video for 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 older people but also for younger people 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 and the whole thing is done by 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.090
 a familiar one of mine that used to be in 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 the handball bundesliga has played 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 a few years ago but to the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 Exercises you can see that it stops 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.640
 just things from the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.289
 outdoor area of ​​ball sports 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 but primarily, of course, you can 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.730
 also as general he as general 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 make a circle and that's how I do it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 done whole and i can tell you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.840
 So he like the video cut the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 You see, I always have that one minute 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.939
 load and 30 seconds break 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 And maybe I have half of all 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 Exercises at all over time 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 I 'm in a row 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 already packaged earlier or must 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.119
 somehow the movements executions 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 neglecting the wales video counts 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.210
 and I always stand out he pauses 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.340
 Classemann I always leave the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 follow the full 60 seconds running 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.840
 but the video is too long and important 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.970
 simply if your home is a power plant 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 the high intensity makes the whole body 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.259
 burden and short break time means 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 The load must always be twice as long 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.729
 be like the break time looking that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 doing exercises for the whole body 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.790
 not just for the stomach or for the legs or 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.570
 for upper body take care of everything 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:00.329
 possible when it comes and look at 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 the video just to a part of the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.560
 I have exercises with tools or 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.170
 with appliances if you have them 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 devices are not available or 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.500
 other devices then would have to look easy 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.200
 okay, what do I have with the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 Exercise exercises how can I do that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 improvising just says a bit 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.209
 creative on the spot 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.440
 and now I wish wish you much 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.370
 fun while watching 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 see you later german 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.690
 further shoulder and arm 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.780
 because I suddenly hit 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.630
 the arms stretched and the summer 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.500
 just seems that the poor 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:15.639
 straightener and slowly a super 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.639
 well and now nice again 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.690
 speak small slowly 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.120
 but very slowly there remain the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.840
 thighs now when the feet 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:32.330
 conversation more beautiful and not young 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:32.330
 company will stay 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.080
 the
