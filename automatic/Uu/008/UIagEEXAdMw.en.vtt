00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
about six months I'll have about double
this<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:37.590> done<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.070> plus

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
this but if I we're done with him plus

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.179 
this but if I we're done with him plus
we're<00:01:38.490> planning<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> second<00:01:39.240> transplant<00:01:40.189> next

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
we're planning a second transplant next

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.069 
we're planning a second transplant next
summer<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.299> year<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> half<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:42.990> now

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
summer so by a year and a half from now

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
summer so by a year and a half from now
we<00:01:43.320> should<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.770> four<00:01:44.070> times<00:01:44.250> as

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we should have about four times as

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.270 
we should have about four times as
another<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.649> a<00:01:46.649> huge

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
another here so you can see a huge

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
another here so you can see a huge
difference<00:01:47.340> compared<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> me<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.540> photos<00:01:48.930> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
difference compared to me for photos now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.289 
difference compared to me for photos now
when<00:01:49.439> we're<00:01:49.590> talking<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.009> transplant<00:01:50.399> what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
when we're talking here transplant what

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
when we're talking here transplant what
really<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> procedure<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.920> well

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
really is the procedure all about well

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
really is the procedure all about well
basically<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.329> hair<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> back<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
basically the hair on the back of the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050 
basically the hair on the back of the
head<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.290> permanent<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.549> hair<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
head is permanent and the hair on the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
head is permanent and the hair on the
top<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.780> genetically<00:01:58.320> programmed<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.159> fall

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
top is genetically programmed to fall

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.240 
top is genetically programmed to fall
out<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.149> people<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:01.079> look<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.590> fellows<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
out so people you look at fellows in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.830 
out so people you look at fellows in
their<00:02:02.520> 70s<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.030> 80s<00:02:03.149> they<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.570> have

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
their 70s and 80s they all have

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
permanent hair on the back of their head

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.820 
permanent hair on the back of their head
they<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.150> have<00:02:06.299> hair<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
they all have hair that is there for the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.169 
they all have hair that is there for the
rest<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.130> their<00:02:08.220> life<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.880> move

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
rest of their life so what we do is move

rest of their life so what we do is move
these<00:02:09.479> follicles<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> top<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.459> by

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
these follicles up to the top and by

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.000 
these follicles up to the top and by
doing<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.600> those<00:02:12.930> follicles<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.560> continue

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
doing that those follicles will continue

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.100 
doing that those follicles will continue
to<00:02:14.130> grow<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.610> rest<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.910> his<00:02:15.000> life<00:02:15.060> Wow<00:02:15.720> so

is this an it you have to get individual
hair<00:02:18.450> follicles<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.170> move<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.800> well<00:02:20.040> what

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
hair follicles and move them well what

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.949 
hair follicles and move them well what
we<00:02:20.430> do<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.640> yeah<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:21.030> take<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.510> hair<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:21.930> of

we do is yeah we take the hair out of
the<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> night<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.069> sect<00:02:23.370> that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the back and the night the sect that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.860 
the back and the night the sect that
you've<00:02:23.670> got<00:02:23.819> microscopes<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> back<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you've got microscopes at the back of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.360 
you've got microscopes at the back of
you<00:02:25.170> dissect<00:02:25.530> those<00:02:25.680> under<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:25.980> microscope

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you dissect those under the microscope

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
you dissect those under the microscope
into<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.330> two<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:27.959> hair<00:02:28.140> grafts<00:02:28.410> and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
into one two and three hair grafts and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
into one two and three hair grafts and
then<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.130> basically<00:02:29.400> plant<00:02:29.940> them<00:02:30.090> into

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
then we just basically plant them into

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.910 
then we just basically plant them into
neagle<00:02:30.630> holes<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.770> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
neagle holes so you can see here that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.010 
neagle holes so you can see here that
looks<00:02:32.459> perfectly<00:02:32.970> natural<00:02:33.209> little<00:02:33.720> time<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
looks perfectly natural little time to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.540 
looks perfectly natural little time to
respect<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.890> normal<00:02:35.220> head<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.459> hair

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
respect that from a normal head of hair

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.190 
respect that from a normal head of hair

job to do I mean that's tiny work well
with<00:02:44.220> Don<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.610> transplanted<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.390> three<00:02:45.630> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
with Don we transplanted about three and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.990 
with Don we transplanted about three and
a<00:02:45.780> half<00:02:45.810> thousand<00:02:46.470> Wow<00:02:46.769> laughs<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.790> about

seven or eight thousand hairs in a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680 
seven or eight thousand hairs in a
sitting<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.640> takes<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.150> surgery<00:02:51.569> actually
