00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 very good today we will see how to germinate 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.740
 basil seeds a very plant 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.349
 powerful against insects that do not 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.120
 they benefit for nothing our orchard already 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 that its strong aroma confuses us 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.250
 confuses even in some cases the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 repels I have here these flowers of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.780
 last year and that each one can host 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 so we break it you see 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.460
 between 3 and 4 seeds more or less 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 normal in this species and at least 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.560
 with this variety it is usually 4 but you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 you can find that you have three 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.040
 I have two full packages from last year 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.550
 and the truth is that I will have seeds 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.100
 for times 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.649
 as usual in this channel and because 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.620
 it works very well for me to teach 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.980
 these examples I will use again 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.820
 the napkin method 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.150
 and here I have some seeds prepared 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.710
 let's see the process 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.620
 from experience of having been ordered 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.010
 other years 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.850
 yes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.430
 then we scatter 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.530
 if by placing the water and passing 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.530
 days usually two or three 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.630
 You see that in the seed the little ball is 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 black is generated as a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.039
 How could you say a coat of hair 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 whitish not like that 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.119
 do not worry is normal is the process 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.120
 of germination that this seed has in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.270
 concrete 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.230
 and expect to have patience keep the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 moisture that does not get too hot 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.370
 and little else I will proceed for the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 company water and now once they pass 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.659
 around four or five days 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.299
 we continue 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.210
 it's been four days so 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.460
 we are going to see results and they appear very 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.159
 favorable when we see that the roots 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.210
 they have crossed the napkin 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.630
 by several parties 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.470
 final I put a few more because the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.470
 I will take to the garden 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.200
 for the subject of pests and others and how 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.200
 you can see 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 they are beautifully just plant that 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.470
 germinates very easily 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.830
 and if you look you can see the jelly or 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.170
 the white layer that will be appreciated a lot in 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.630
 the bed 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.620
 of which I spoke to you all the seeds of 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.080
 basil generated in this capital 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.960
 so do not worry because you can 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.510
 misleading to think that they are 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.760
 rotting or degrading or something and 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.480
 throw throw the seeds that still 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 they would be viable 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.900
 and if you look you see the first two 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.959
 containers 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.660
 until they do not open and teach their 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.770
 two real leaves I will not pass them yet 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.319
 to a nursery 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.310
 or planter 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.290
 thus putting him already a moon 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.090
 and then when they have a little bit of 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.090
 vigor and strength to the garden 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.250
 and that's how you see it's nothing 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.250
 complicated there are many 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.490
 Now I would have a little work when 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.270
 are ready to transplant 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.090
 but they are going to buy an ecological mission 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.830
 and certainly more than one level 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.590
 house is also good for 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.880
 to cook for aromatic because it 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.070
 like the smell the truth is that it smells 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.240
 quite strong even up to 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.490
 seeds 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.440
 and that is all any doubt not 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.060
 forget to comment 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.060
 and see you next video
