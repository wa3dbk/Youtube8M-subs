00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.230 
nothing too severe you don't want to
make<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.409> uncomfortable<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.670> do<00:01:48.940> this<00:01:49.090> on

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
make it uncomfortable you can do this on

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.180 
make it uncomfortable you can do this on
shorter<00:01:49.750> hair<00:01:50.020> too<00:01:50.260> but<00:01:50.560> obviously<00:01:50.920> if<00:01:51.040> it's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
shorter hair too but obviously if it's

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.160 
shorter hair too but obviously if it's
too<00:01:51.400> short<00:01:51.700> they<00:01:52.270> can<00:01:52.300> just<00:01:52.630> leave<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.960> move

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
too short they can just leave that move

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.130 
too short they can just leave that move
out<00:01:53.400> we<00:01:54.400> can<00:01:54.580> also<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:55.000> strokes<00:01:55.570> through<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
out we can also do strokes through the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380 
out we can also do strokes through the
hair<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:57.190> almost<00:01:57.370> as<00:01:57.640> if<00:01:57.670> you're<00:01:57.909> coming

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
hair and it's almost as if you're coming

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.170 
hair and it's almost as if you're coming
through<00:01:58.420> with<00:01:58.810> your<00:01:58.960> fingers<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.880> again<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
through with your fingers and again the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.870 
through with your fingers and again the
slower<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.750> better<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.409> don't<00:02:03.250> be<00:02:03.370> afraid<00:02:03.610> to

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
slower the better and don't be afraid to

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.280 
slower the better and don't be afraid to
really<00:02:04.060> get<00:02:04.300> in<00:02:04.390> there<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.930> even<00:02:05.080> set

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
really get in there and you can even set

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.560 
really get in there and you can even set
a<00:02:05.320> zigzag<00:02:05.770> again<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.430> feels<00:02:06.790> really<00:02:07.060> nice<00:02:07.300> and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
a zigzag again it feels really nice and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.630 
a zigzag again it feels really nice and
relaxing<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.739> also<00:02:08.890> work<00:02:09.190> underneath

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
relaxing you can also work underneath

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.319 
relaxing you can also work underneath
too<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:11.739> can<00:02:11.950> pluck<00:02:12.310> which<00:02:12.609> is<00:02:12.760> quite<00:02:12.969> good<00:02:13.150> for

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
too we can pluck which is quite good for

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.069 
too we can pluck which is quite good for
stimulating<00:02:13.989> hair<00:02:14.260> growth<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.749> again<00:02:16.749> you're

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
stimulating hair growth and again you're

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.090 
stimulating hair growth and again you're
almost<00:02:17.260> sort<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.680> pen

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
almost sort of pen

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.890 
almost sort of pen
with<00:02:18.400> your<00:02:18.550> fingers<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.600> where<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
with your fingers this is where you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.640 
with your fingers this is where you
start<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.320> see<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> volume<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
start to see the volume in here and you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.670 
start to see the volume in here and you
can<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.980> pan<00:02:24.400> stroking<00:02:25.150> where<00:02:26.080> one<00:02:26.350> hand

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
can do pan stroking where one hand

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.950 
can do pan stroking where one hand
strokes<00:02:27.190> over<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.060> scalp<00:02:28.360> while<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> other

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
strokes over the scalp while the other

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.220 
strokes over the scalp while the other
hand<00:02:29.370> comes<00:02:30.370> up<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.790> start<00:02:31.090> again<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.080> can

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
hand comes up to start again and you can

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.000 
hand comes up to start again and you can
either<00:02:32.380> do<00:02:32.620> this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
either do this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.480 
either do this
one<00:02:33.220> hand<00:02:33.900> alternate<00:02:34.900> than<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> other<00:02:35.440> or<00:02:35.740> you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
one hand alternate than the other or you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.510 
one hand alternate than the other or you
can<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.790> two<00:02:36.820> hands<00:02:37.480> together<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.170> again<00:02:39.100> take

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
can do two hands together and again take

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280 
can do two hands together and again take
your<00:02:39.730> time<00:02:39.940> because<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.450> slower<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.140> more

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
your time because the slower the more

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.120 
your time because the slower the more
relaxing<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:43.600> can<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.990> static<00:02:44.470> pressures

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
relaxing you can do static pressures

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.830 
relaxing you can do static pressures
which<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> very<00:02:45.640> similar<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.390> circles

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
which is very similar to your circles

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.650 
which is very similar to your circles
except<00:02:47.680> rather<00:02:47.980> than<00:02:48.370> moving<00:02:48.910> your<00:02:49.240> fingers

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
except rather than moving your fingers

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
except rather than moving your fingers
you're<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.230> pushing<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.130> then

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
you're just pushing in and then

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
you're just pushing in and then
releasing<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.880> again<00:02:52.750> these<00:02:52.900> are<00:02:52.960> all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
releasing and again these are all

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.130 
releasing and again these are all
designs<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.860> relax<00:02:54.820> or<00:02:55.090> stimulate<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.960> nerve

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
designs to relax or stimulate the nerve

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.200 
designs to relax or stimulate the nerve
endings<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.680> scalp<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.700> it's<00:02:57.820> also<00:02:57.970> good

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
endings in the scalp but it's also good

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.480 
endings in the scalp but it's also good
for<00:02:58.240> bringing<00:02:58.690> circulation<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.800> blood<00:02:59.950> to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
for bringing circulation and blood to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.010 
for bringing circulation and blood to
the<00:03:00.550> scalp<00:03:00.790> area<00:03:00.970> which<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.540> really<00:03:01.840> good<00:03:01.990> for

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
the scalp area which is really good for

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.560 
the scalp area which is really good for
boosting<00:03:02.560> healthy<00:03:03.040> hair<00:03:03.220> growth<00:03:03.420> when<00:03:04.420> you're

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
boosting healthy hair growth when you're

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.210 
boosting healthy hair growth when you're
doing<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.900> again<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.650> your<00:03:05.830> strips

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
doing this again what can your strips

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.920 
doing this again what can your strips
from<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.930> inside-out<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.740> take<00:03:09.130> your<00:03:09.340> time

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
from the inside-out and take your time

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.290 
from the inside-out and take your time
if<00:03:11.310> you've<00:03:12.310> done<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.520> lot<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.850> stimulating

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
if you've done a lot of stimulating

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.880 
if you've done a lot of stimulating
moves<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.630> can<00:03:13.780> dream<00:03:14.020> which<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> bit<00:03:14.710> like

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
moves you can dream which is a bit like

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.110 
moves you can dream which is a bit like
the<00:03:14.920> effleurage<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:15.580> you're<00:03:15.700> just<00:03:15.880> draining

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the effleurage but you're just draining

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.300 
the effleurage but you're just draining
to<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> neck<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.530> if<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.770> feel<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.190> you've

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
to the neck so if you feel that you've

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.710 
to the neck so if you feel that you've
done<00:03:18.430> quite<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> lot<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:19.060> stimulating<00:03:19.540> moves

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
done quite a lot of stimulating moves

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.500 
done quite a lot of stimulating moves
maybe<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.680> pop<00:03:21.010> some<00:03:21.370> maybe<00:03:22.060> two<00:03:22.390> or<00:03:22.480> three

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
maybe just pop some maybe two or three

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.960 
maybe just pop some maybe two or three
draining<00:03:23.050> moves<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.430> relax<00:03:24.760> and

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
draining moves in just to relax and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.940 
draining moves in just to relax and
soothe<00:03:26.130> you've<00:03:27.130> also<00:03:27.310> got<00:03:27.780> tapping<00:03:28.950> which

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
soothe you've also got tapping which

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.230 
soothe you've also got tapping which
again<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.340> really<00:03:30.370> good<00:03:30.730> for<00:03:30.850> boosting

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
again is really good for boosting

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.860 
again is really good for boosting
circulation<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.970> again<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.270> can<00:03:34.420> tap<00:03:34.630> all

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
circulation and again you can tap all

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.190 
circulation and again you can tap all
over<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.380> head

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200 

you<00:03:42.680> can<00:03:42.800> also<00:03:42.920> squeeze<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.490> left<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:43.970> get

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
you can also squeeze in left so you get

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.800

and nutrients to scalp area there's lots

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.040 
and nutrients to scalp area there's lots
of<00:04:46.729> more<00:04:46.880> moves<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.300> can<00:04:47.330> do<00:04:47.690> but<00:04:47.900> that's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
of more moves that you can do but that's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.050 
of more moves that you can do but that's
just<00:04:48.200> a<00:04:48.350> good<00:04:48.590> selection<00:04:49.250> for<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.700> scalp<00:04:49.970> so

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
just a good selection for the scalp so

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.870 
just a good selection for the scalp so
when<00:04:50.300> you're<00:04:50.419> finished<00:04:50.840> just<00:04:51.800> start<00:04:52.310> with<00:04:52.850> a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
when you're finished just start with a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.840 
when you're finished just start with a
fluorite<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.479> finish<00:04:53.870> with<00:04:54.050> effleurage<00:04:54.380> so

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
fluorite and finish with effleurage so

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.420 
fluorite and finish with effleurage so
all<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.030> way<00:04:56.169> down<00:04:57.169> from<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.740> head<00:04:57.950> over<00:04:58.220> the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
all the way down from the head over the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.920 
all the way down from the head over the
neck<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.820> shoulders<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> down<00:05:00.320> at<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.740> arms

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
neck and shoulders and down at the arms

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.830 
neck and shoulders and down at the arms
so<00:05:02.930> you'd<00:05:03.080> expect<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.680> spend<00:05:03.979> maybe<00:05:04.220> about<00:05:04.840> 15

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
so you'd expect to spend maybe about 15

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.719 
so you'd expect to spend maybe about 15
to<00:05:06.020> 20<00:05:06.440> minutes<00:05:06.740> on<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.070> scalp<00:05:07.400> when<00:05:07.610> you're

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
to 20 minutes on the scalp when you're

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.730 
to 20 minutes on the scalp when you're
doing<00:05:07.940> an<00:05:08.150> ending<00:05:08.810> head<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.200> such

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.800 

you
