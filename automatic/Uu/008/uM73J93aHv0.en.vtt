headset<00:01:58.439> mic<00:01:58.679> doesn't<00:01:59.069> matter<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.520> any

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
headset mic doesn't matter for any

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
headset mic doesn't matter for any
badness<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.539> voice<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.189> when<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.459> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
badness in my voice and when I get a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.699 
badness in my voice and when I get a
really<00:02:02.939> HD<00:02:03.329> crystal-clear<00:02:03.869> microphone<00:02:04.499> i

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
really HD crystal-clear microphone i

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.499 
really HD crystal-clear microphone i
actually<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.429> realized<00:02:06.209> that<00:02:06.270> i<00:02:06.359> actually

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
actually just realized that i actually

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.870 
actually just realized that i actually
sound<00:02:06.899> retarded<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.679> that's<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.700> i'm<00:02:08.759> hoping

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
sound retarded so that's what i'm hoping

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.330 
sound retarded so that's what i'm hoping
that's<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> happen<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:11.160> goal

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that's not going to happen but the goal

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.839 
that's not going to happen but the goal
is<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> chew<00:02:12.299> up<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> quality<00:02:13.459> for<00:02:14.459> my<00:02:14.549> videos

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
is to chew up the quality for my videos

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.040 
is to chew up the quality for my videos
at<00:02:15.060> least

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
at least

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.500 
at least
and<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.800> feel<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.430> microphone<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> best

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and I feel a microphone is the best

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.660 
and I feel a microphone is the best
place<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.840> start<00:02:19.020> apart<00:02:19.350> from<00:02:19.530> getting<00:02:19.800> better

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
place to start apart from getting better

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.370 
place to start apart from getting better
looking<00:02:21.150> videos<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:21.990> can't<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.350> much

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
looking videos I really can't do much

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.430 
looking videos I really can't do much
relevant<00:02:22.920> 720p<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> most

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
relevant 720p and really that's the most

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.050 
relevant 720p and really that's the most
I<00:02:25.770> don't<00:02:26.460> know<00:02:26.550> how<00:02:26.640> many<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> guys

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
I don't know how many of you guys

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.600 
I don't know how many of you guys
watched<00:02:27.390> any<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:28.080> videos<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.560> 1080p<00:02:28.740> but<00:02:29.550> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
watched any like videos in 1080p but I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
watched any like videos in 1080p but I
feel<00:02:29.760> 720's<00:02:30.420> adequate<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:30.990> that's<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.350> I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
feel 720's adequate so that's what I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
feel 720's adequate so that's what I
render<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.520> feel<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.730> my<00:02:32.940> video

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
render in but I feel like my video

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.900 
render in but I feel like my video
portion<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.750> somewhat<00:02:34.320> adequate<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.890> audio<00:02:35.850> I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
portion is somewhat adequate so audio I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.580 
portion is somewhat adequate so audio I
felt<00:02:36.210> was<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:36.630> bit<00:02:36.750> lacking<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.350> that's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
felt was a little bit lacking so that's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
felt was a little bit lacking so that's
why<00:02:37.770> we're<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.220> picking<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.550> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
from that I really wanted to just get

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.380 
from that I really wanted to just get
out<00:03:26.130> some<00:03:26.370> code<00:03:26.580> because<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.030> haven't<00:03:27.150> posted

this<00:04:37.400> game<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.820> have<00:04:38.240> no<00:04:38.420> complaints<00:04:38.600> with<00:04:38.930> you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050

this game I have no complaints with you
yet<00:04:39.290> I'm<00:04:39.920> not<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> bad<00:04:40.550> end<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.880> lag

compensation<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.320> guess<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:42.740> nulled<00:04:43.670> a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
compensation so I guess that's nulled a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.880 
compensation so I guess that's nulled a
lot<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.060> complaints<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.840> are<00:04:44.870> fairly<00:04:45.500> coming
