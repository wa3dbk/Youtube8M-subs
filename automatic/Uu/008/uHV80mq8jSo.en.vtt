 can be considered our survival 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.799
 the sword machine gun became the most

 the owner is enormous 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.400
 advantage over the enemy 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.740

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.550
 thrice 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.009
 on time then why 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.899
 beggars design is incredible

 which made it easier to release his hands a little 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.590

 women and children 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.990
 after the shot, the recoil was thrown back behind 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.829
 the fact that here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.220
 new special pool 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.240
 to pay off neither energy nor 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.860
 reload automatic 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.120
 interesting and oblique means of Latvia 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.900
 Poland 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.230
 it was made to powder 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.410
 gases hitting the board did not speak 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.540
 not allowed to climb the trunk 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.910
 patron dad was a powerful mauser 7 62

 being carried on in the gun stage 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.070
 of the shortcomings of beggars 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 there was a lot of weight and unreliable too 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.500
 like a clock 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 she is often weak or worse movie 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 therefore appeared powder and shops 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 like German 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.210
 but it is more than volume 35

 ammunition and poland was good oho but 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 addition to what

 Congresswoman such a massive swim 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.090
 magnificent in its operational

 prevented that weakened defense 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.379
 a lot of repetition was stored in warehouses 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 already started and 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.799
 on this automaton sudeva today 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.619
 appreciated
