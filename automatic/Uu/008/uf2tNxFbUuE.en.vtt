00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.110
 well here I think that week 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 happened normally 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.690
 gg is to make people aware 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 players through the workouts 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.830
 and a few sentences that the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 westerlo's match was maybe more 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 important that the anderlecht match for 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 that we find values ​​for 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.330
 charleroi make change for one says 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.490
 not yet charleroi is able to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.769
 beat a team like anderlech t then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.869
 falls back into its midst against a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.219
 team at our height and so we have 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 a lot insisted on it and is 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.690
 indeed one of the reasons why 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 I did not give leave of Monday 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 as I usually do after a beautiful 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 performance and precisely for them 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 realize that here I wanted 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.559
 see right away at the field I you 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.210
 had it right away 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.520
 training and that we had to feel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.039
 involved very quickly in the match of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 waterloo the desire is that we make a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.000
 big benefit tomorrow and finally 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.770
 prove to all Belgium that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 charleroi is slowly moving 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 change and that he is able to beat 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.570
 anderlecht but he is also able to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.309
 beat a team that is up to it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.660
 the week that follows and that for me it's 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 the most important today is not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.420
 it's not for the ranking it's not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 for for for boasting or what 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 it's just for us 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.240
 gets to change charleroi and that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.860
 charleroi 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 shows everyone that when he has 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.920
 qualities he can install them in 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 time and not just about a match 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.120
 or two yes I knew charleroi in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620
 being a child when I arrived here at 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.770
 charleroi and that I signed my first 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.060
 professional contract in division 1 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.250
 I pointed out that when I was little 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 we felt the pudding we felt lambourg 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.370
 hours we felt the fries that this 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.310
 stadium was hot that this stadium was 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.320
 filled with people and that's if we can 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 together that that on the direction the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.440
 staff the players try to get 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.030
 bring as close as possible to these 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.930
 moments there I think it would already be 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 a great success 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.900
 this is an important phenomenon and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.180
 I would like once and for all 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.620
 reported to all to all 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.700
 people who analyzes us for the purchase at 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.650
 all the people watching us 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.080
 that we stop a good time for 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.430
 all to devalue my players if my 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.470
 players did a benefit like 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.660
 the one against anderlech or like 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.149
 the one against bruges or against 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.420
 those as against mouscron is that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.340
 my players have quality 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.930
 and they proved it these last 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 weeks and it may not be 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.690
 always because of the opponent because 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.770
 that he is less well or because of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.620
 the opponent because he prepares a 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.959
 european cup match or because 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.530
 the opponent plays less well in a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.920
 day without 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.590
 it may also be because of or because of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.410
 of charleroi that slowly begins to 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.209
 find who has qualities and so me 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.830
 I am against the fact that 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.270
 devalorise all the time charleroi we 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.040
 devalues ​​the quality of my players 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.940
 to highlight perhaps the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.890
 poorer performance 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.959
 the opponent it might be well 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060
 that they help me a lot more value 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.320
 the qualities of my group the envi 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 group and the mood of the group 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.100
 at the present time for the moment 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.600
 I do not even think about that for the moment 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.519
 I think of all these values ​​that I 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.380
 just explained i think about my group 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.209
 I think of the group that has to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
 try to continue to progress I 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 think of the group who must who should keep 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.380
 these values ​​that must keep its qualities 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.930
 who has to show his qualities 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.550
 after that for me the top if not 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.030
 not an obsession for the moment I 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.610
 think every week every week 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
 to this difficulty to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.470
 enough problems for them to 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.880
 solve and after that if we are we have 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.600
 the happiness of getting closer one more 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.430
 little more so much better 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.430
 and if not well it will be for the future
