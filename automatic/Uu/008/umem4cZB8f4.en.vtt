those<00:04:13.120> extension<00:04:13.780> cords<00:04:13.989> made<00:04:14.110> out<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.440> so

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
those extension cords made out of so

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.740 
those extension cords made out of so
they<00:04:14.800> don't<00:04:14.950> hold<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.340> shape<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.880> what<00:04:16.540> they

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
they don't hold the shape of what they

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.750 
they don't hold the shape of what they
were<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.970> it's<00:04:18.970> flexible

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
were and it's flexible

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.650 
were and it's flexible
because<00:04:21.690> yeah<00:04:21.990> that's<00:04:23.120> what<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> got<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.480> have

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
because yeah that's what I got to have

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660 
because yeah that's what I got to have
an<00:04:24.990> accord<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.980> cord<00:04:26.220> could<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> little

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
an accord but the cord could be a little

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.320 
an accord but the cord could be a little
bit<00:04:26.850> better<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> little<00:04:29.940> on<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> stiff

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
bit better it is a little on the stiff

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.710 
bit better it is a little on the stiff
side<00:04:31.400> but<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.670> mean<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.240> doesn't<00:04:33.600> bother

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
side but I mean if that doesn't bother

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800 
side but I mean if that doesn't bother
you<00:04:33.870> then<00:04:34.410> whatever<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.700> it's<00:04:36.210> got<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.540> cord

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
you then whatever so it's got the cord

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.890 
you then whatever so it's got the cord
so<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.050> doesn't<00:04:37.290> lose<00:04:37.380> power<00:04:38.360> but<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.570> doesn't

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
so it doesn't lose power but it doesn't

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.540 
so it doesn't lose power but it doesn't
seem<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.110> lose<00:04:40.230> power<00:04:40.500> when<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.800> gets<00:04:40.950> clogged

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
seem to lose power when it gets clogged

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.180 
seem to lose power when it gets clogged
up<00:04:41.760> with<00:04:42.080> dust<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.560> from<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.770> carpet

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
up with dust and from the carpet

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.850 
up with dust and from the carpet
and<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.790> picked<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.570> ton<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.860> dust

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
and it picked up a ton of dust

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.440 
and it picked up a ton of dust
because<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.310> shoulda<00:04:47.520> guys<00:04:48.120> should've<00:04:48.420> seen

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
because you shoulda guys should've seen

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.360 
because you shoulda guys should've seen
when<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.960> was<00:04:49.560> pulling<00:04:49.860> out<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.100> filter

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
when I was pulling out of this filter

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.100 
when I was pulling out of this filter
yesterday<00:04:50.940> sticking<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.690> trash<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:52.080> over

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
yesterday sticking in the trash can over

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.250 
yesterday sticking in the trash can over
there<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:53.340> was<00:04:53.460> amazing<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:53.910> was<00:04:54.000> like<00:04:54.260> that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
there it was amazing it was like that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.190 
there it was amazing it was like that
vacuum<00:04:55.800> cleaner<00:04:56.040> but<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> smaller<00:04:56.970> size<00:04:57.330> and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
vacuum cleaner but on a smaller size and

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.400 
vacuum cleaner but on a smaller size and
I<00:04:58.620> don't<00:04:58.680> know<00:04:58.830> how<00:04:59.010> big<00:04:59.250> this<00:05:00.110> head<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.290> I

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
I don't know how big this head is I

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.160 
I don't know how big this head is I
think<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.680> like<00:05:01.800> probably<00:05:02.370> eight<00:05:02.670> inches

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
think it's like probably eight inches

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.750 
think it's like probably eight inches
and<00:05:04.170> that<00:05:04.860> one<00:05:04.980> over<00:05:05.130> there<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:05.430> twelve

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
and that one over there is like twelve

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.540 
and that one over there is like twelve
or<00:05:05.940> something<00:05:06.210> like<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.390> I'm<00:05:06.690> not<00:05:06.930> sure<00:05:07.140> but

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
or something like that I'm not sure but

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.350 
or something like that I'm not sure but
it's<00:05:08.550> good<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:09.000> small<00:05:09.090> areas<00:05:09.570> bathrooms

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
it's good for small areas bathrooms

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.970 
it's good for small areas bathrooms

don't know if any of this over here
is<00:05:18.990> noticeable<00:05:19.380> because<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:20.220> these<00:05:21.210> end

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
broke off when I was moving it and

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.040 
broke off when I was moving it and
here's<00:05:29.400> my<00:05:29.610> moving<00:05:30.000> technique<00:05:30.450> just<00:05:30.780> because

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
here's my moving technique just because

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.390 
here's my moving technique just because

this thing weighs this entertainment

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.400 
this thing weighs this entertainment

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
of a slick wood under there that's like

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.800 
of a slick wood under there that's like
the<00:05:37.860> same<00:05:38.040> materials<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.600> push<00:05:39.780> it
