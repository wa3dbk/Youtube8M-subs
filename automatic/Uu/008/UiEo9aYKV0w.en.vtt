modpodge the the outer area where they

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.540 
modpodge the the outer area where they
rub<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.660> lot<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.860> when<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.370> do

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
rub it a lot just so that when we do

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.860 
rub it a lot just so that when we do
want<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.790> change<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.210> which<00:03:17.360> I'm<00:03:17.510> sure<00:03:17.690> we're

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
want to change it which I'm sure we're

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.830 
want to change it which I'm sure we're
eventually<00:03:18.290> going<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.560> change<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.280> up<00:03:19.400> um<00:03:20.270> we

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
eventually going to change it up um we

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.230 
eventually going to change it up um we
can<00:03:20.990> just<00:03:21.200> easily<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.770> out<00:03:21.890> most<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.730> and
