00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.570
 Welcome to a new tutorial today 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.390

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:31.680
 given poland and a description 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:37.660
 So today it's about gta 4 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.430
 How about this game of ours? 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.280
 I say six hours yesterday 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
 spent figuring out how to do this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.120
 games can even get started 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.730
 is a port of a console 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.760
 on the pc as well as all just that 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.430
 I already did great because data 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.540
 weeks shit has built here 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.880
 greetings times beautiful and we are now one shows 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.199
 here gta4 can run without 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.380
 that in the menu with the options at the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.200
 Graphics is far too little 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.560
 8 x 600 is due to too little 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.750
 stores so friends she is doing time in 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.710
 golf in peace also saved or 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.829
 game 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.179
 I do my installed that is with me 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:27.009
 here so take the lounge i have 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.539
 this supposedly brings an update made 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.010
 is update package lines description 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.780
 operate 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.880
 the loud goes there you press on 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 create links or make a power 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.299
 send here to desktop link 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.280
 this better 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.520
 we have the linkage 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.830
 So that's why I'm supposed to be here 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 know delete again 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.640
 and because this link expresses exactly 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 property and here is the goal 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.369
 So what exactly should open now 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 Normally there is only so much in it 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.800
 end what I you now down to the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.239
 description of a letter about 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.030
 you should also write here 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.110
 so be pure so his spacebar so 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.930
 first press spacebar to then 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.700
 insert what I wrote 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.170
 That's a command 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.090
 the graphics options that the halt 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.400
 be raised up or 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.570
 I'll show you the same time once 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:54.710
 short left 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:56.900
 gta 4 for proof we wait your course 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.790
 of course cd in there and I have none 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.040
 Go on the cracks because of contemplative time 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:11.690
 waste a lot of money as long as I do 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:15.040
 So expect it here again 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.040
 I have to say pretty much 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.450
 story films have had double 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.170
 and can these tips so here too 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.170
