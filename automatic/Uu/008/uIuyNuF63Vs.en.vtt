00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
changed a little bit since um since the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.610 
changed a little bit since um since the
first<00:02:43.030> time<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.240> put<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:44.320> actually

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
first time I put it up and they actually

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
first time I put it up and they actually
do<00:02:44.770> recommend<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:45.550> I'll<00:02:45.730> show<00:02:45.760> you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
do recommend this because I'll show you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.850 
do recommend this because I'll show you
so<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.440> want<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.810> actually<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:54.250> actually

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.180 

I<00:02:56.950> think<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.820> might<00:02:58.030> buy<00:02:58.300> because<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.860> pole

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
I think you might buy because the pole

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.390 
I think you might buy because the pole
was<00:03:00.400> actually<00:03:00.910> going<00:03:01.150> through<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.800> sort<00:03:03.280> of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
was actually going through the sort of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.420 
was actually going through the sort of
fly<00:03:04.410> through<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.470> top<00:03:05.680> fly<00:03:05.950> rather<00:03:06.250> than

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
fly through a top fly rather than

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.130 
fly through a top fly rather than
actually<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.790> through<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.090> tent<00:03:07.420> it's

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
actually going through a tent it's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.430 
actually going through a tent it's
actually<00:03:08.530> sort<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.040> hanging<00:03:09.280> tent<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.880> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
actually sort of a hanging tent in that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.050 
actually sort of a hanging tent in that
you<00:03:11.440> put<00:03:11.650> everything<00:03:11.920> through<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> fly<00:03:12.670> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
you put everything through the fly and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.810 
you put everything through the fly and
then<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:14.080> orange<00:03:14.410> 10-part<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.460> actually

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
then this orange 10-part you actually

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.140 
then this orange 10-part you actually
have<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.240> connect<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.800> top<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.880> top<00:03:19.030> of

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
have to connect to the top of the top of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.340 
have to connect to the top of the top of
the<00:03:19.240> fly<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> they<00:03:20.650> actually<00:03:21.010> sort<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.250> just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the fly so they actually sort of just

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.600 
the fly so they actually sort of just
sort<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.410> sort<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.770> hangs<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.459> can

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
sort of sort of hangs but then you can

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.840 
sort of sort of hangs but then you can
also<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.840> also<00:03:26.110> clip<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.740> orange<00:03:27.730> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
also you also clip it to the orange to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.940 
also you also clip it to the orange to
the<00:03:27.940> bottom<00:03:28.209> corners<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.660> well<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.170> there<00:03:29.830> is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the bottom corners as well so there is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.570 
the bottom corners as well so there is
tension<00:03:30.190> there<00:03:30.520> at<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.670> bottom<00:03:30.850> as<00:03:31.090> well<00:03:32.580> it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
tension there at the bottom as well it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.190 
tension there at the bottom as well it
is<00:03:33.640> really<00:03:33.970> quite<00:03:34.300> tight<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.989> am<00:03:35.940> about<00:03:36.940> five<00:03:37.450> of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
is really quite tight I am about five of

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.300 
is really quite tight I am about five of
about<00:03:38.350> five<00:03:38.590> seven<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:40.150> quite<00:03:40.330> tight

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
about five seven and it's quite tight

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.260 
about five seven and it's quite tight
you<00:03:42.310> probably<00:03:42.610> wouldn't<00:03:42.880> want<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> be

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
you probably wouldn't want to be

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.020 
you probably wouldn't want to be
claustrophobic<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.860> because<00:03:45.250> when

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
claustrophobic and have it because when

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.890 
claustrophobic and have it because when
you're<00:03:46.180> lying<00:03:46.390> down<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:48.160> roof<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.900> even

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
you're lying down the roof is even

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.810 
you're lying down the roof is even
though<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.110> got<00:03:50.200> compression<00:03:50.800> straps<00:03:51.580> here

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
though it's got compression straps here

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.110 
though it's got compression straps here
so<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.720> tighten<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.200> out<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.730> is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so you can tighten it out it is a it is

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.440 
so you can tighten it out it is a it is
still<00:03:55.420> quite<00:03:55.690> close<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.140> your<00:03:56.230> face<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:57.730> me

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
still quite close to your face for me

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.110 
still quite close to your face for me
and<00:03:58.600> my<00:03:58.690> lower<00:03:58.870> back<00:03:59.200> it's<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.500> lot<00:03:59.680> less<00:03:59.830> space

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and my lower back it's a lot less space

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.360 
and my lower back it's a lot less space
my<00:04:01.510> fiance<00:04:01.930> night<00:04:02.110> hopped<00:04:02.320> inside<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
my fiance night hopped inside it and it

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.660 
my fiance night hopped inside it and it
was<00:04:03.489> quite<00:04:03.730> tight<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:06.220> probably<00:04:06.519> wouldn't

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
was quite tight and it probably wouldn't

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.050 
was quite tight and it probably wouldn't
be<00:04:06.730> about<00:04:07.030> much<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.570> it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.050 

the<00:04:11.060> reason<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:11.660> is<00:04:11.990> for<00:04:12.890> quite<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.670> few

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the reason I like it is for quite a few

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.260 
the reason I like it is for quite a few
reasons<00:04:14.650> because<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.250> obviously<00:04:17.060> it's

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
reasons because is that obviously it's

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.110 
reasons because is that obviously it's
really<00:04:17.300> easy<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.840> put<00:04:17.989> up

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
really easy to put up

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.570 
really easy to put up
you<00:04:20.120> can<00:04:20.360> pack<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.840> away<00:04:20.930> with<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:22.010> tent<00:04:22.280> sort

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
you can pack it away with the tent sort

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.830 
you can pack it away with the tent sort
of<00:04:22.670> already<00:04:22.880> connected<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.570> pretty<00:04:23.750> much

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
of already connected so you pretty much

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.220 
of already connected so you pretty much
once<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.680> buy<00:04:24.920> it<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:26.630> put<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.870> out<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.050> first

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
once you buy it you put it out the first

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.910 
once you buy it you put it out the first
time<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.890> connect<00:04:28.510> connector<00:04:29.620> detent<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
time and connect connector detent to the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.710 
time and connect connector detent to the
fly<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:31.970> once<00:04:32.240> you're<00:04:32.360> putting<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.630> down

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
fly and then once you're putting it down

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.420 
fly and then once you're putting it down
you<00:04:32.960> don't<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.980> connect<00:04:34.250> them<00:04:34.310> at

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
you don't have to just connect them at

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.700 
you don't have to just connect them at
all<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.670> can<00:04:34.820> sort<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.090> roll<00:04:35.300> them<00:04:35.480> up<00:04:35.570> as<00:04:36.350> one

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
all you can sort of roll them up as one

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.050 
all you can sort of roll them up as one
which<00:04:36.890> makes<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.280> lot<00:04:37.460> easier<00:04:37.520> when<00:04:37.940> you're

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
which makes it a lot easier when you're

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.880 
which makes it a lot easier when you're
putting<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.360> up<00:04:38.450> basically<00:04:39.350> all<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.710> have<00:04:39.800> to

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
putting it up basically all you have to

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.310 
putting it up basically all you have to
do<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.400> what<00:04:41.030> I've<00:04:41.150> just<00:04:41.210> done<00:04:41.480> then<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:41.960> just

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
do and what I've just done then is just

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.100 
do and what I've just done then is just
put<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.890> two<00:04:43.100> Poe's<00:04:43.480> two<00:04:44.480> plus<00:04:44.750> three<00:04:44.870> you've

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
put the two Poe's two plus three you've

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.600 
put the two Poe's two plus three you've
got<00:04:45.230> one<00:04:45.410> in<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.560> bottom<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.220> have<00:04:46.250> one<00:04:46.490> at

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
got one in the bottom you have one at

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.670 
got one in the bottom you have one at
the<00:04:46.670> top<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.780> just<00:04:47.810> pick<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.260> out<00:04:48.440> and

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the top and then just pick it out and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.070 
the top and then just pick it out and
that's<00:04:49.310> that's<00:04:50.120> literally<00:04:50.510> all<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.810> have<00:04:50.900> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
that's that's literally all you have to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.390 
that's that's literally all you have to
do<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.440> mean<00:04:51.820> it's<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.060> easy<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:54.410> actually<00:04:55.040> like

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
do I mean it's so easy I actually like

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.610 
do I mean it's so easy I actually like
the<00:04:55.550> size<00:04:55.760> because<00:04:56.210> if<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:57.110> know<00:04:57.170> as<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> buyer

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
the size because if you know as a buyer

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.880 
the size because if you know as a buyer
out<00:04:57.770> bag<00:04:58.100> as<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.880> tenth<00:04:59.300> my<00:04:59.570> bag

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
out bag as a tenth my bag

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.740 
out bag as a tenth my bag
I'm<00:05:01.100> not<00:05:01.520> gonna<00:05:01.610> want<00:05:01.850> something<00:05:02.060> overly<00:05:02.510> huge

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
I'm not gonna want something overly huge

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.110 
I'm not gonna want something overly huge
that's<00:05:03.050> pretty<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.620> know<00:05:03.830> I'm<00:05:03.980> gonna<00:05:04.850> be<00:05:05.000> seen

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
that's pretty you know I'm gonna be seen

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.550 
that's pretty you know I'm gonna be seen
hence<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.240> like<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.510> color<00:05:08.720> as<00:05:08.900> well<00:05:09.110> it's<00:05:09.410> sort

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
hence I like to color as well it's sort

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.500 
hence I like to color as well it's sort
of<00:05:09.590> an<00:05:09.740> olive<00:05:10.100> color<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.790> does<00:05:10.970> blend<00:05:11.240> into

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
of an olive color so it does blend into

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.080 
of an olive color so it does blend into
the<00:05:11.780> surroundings<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:13.430> you're<00:05:13.700> sort<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.000> a

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
the surroundings if you're sort of in a

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.820 
the surroundings if you're sort of in a
Porsche<00:05:14.330> or<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.900> forest<00:05:15.500> or<00:05:15.560> something<00:05:15.770> like

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
Porsche or a forest or something like

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.240 
Porsche or a forest or something like
that<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:16.130> going<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.430> blend<00:05:16.640> in<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:18.350> does<00:05:18.860> have

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
that is going to blend in it does have

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.120 
that is going to blend in it does have
the<00:05:19.640> post<00:05:19.880> are<00:05:20.150> reflective<00:05:20.690> though<00:05:21.010> so<00:05:22.010> at

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
the post are reflective though so at

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.470 
the post are reflective though so at
nighttime<00:05:22.520> if<00:05:22.730> someone<00:05:23.000> comes<00:05:23.150> along<00:05:23.270> with<00:05:23.450> a

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
nighttime if someone comes along with a

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480 
nighttime if someone comes along with a
torch<00:05:23.780> that<00:05:24.650> he's<00:05:24.740> going<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.920> be<00:05:25.010> reflective

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
torch that he's going to be reflective

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.510 
torch that he's going to be reflective
but<00:05:25.790> I'm<00:05:26.330> pretty<00:05:26.540> sure<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:28.010> probably<00:05:28.310> be

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
but I'm pretty sure you you probably be

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.100 
but I'm pretty sure you you probably be
able<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.760> wrap<00:05:29.030> some<00:05:29.270> electrical<00:05:29.720> tape<00:05:29.750> around

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
able to wrap some electrical tape around

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.000 
able to wrap some electrical tape around
that<00:05:30.350> or<00:05:31.720> or<00:05:32.720> do<00:05:32.870> something<00:05:33.140> maybe<00:05:33.350> paint<00:05:33.800> it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
that or or do something maybe paint it

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.850 
that or or do something maybe paint it
somehow<00:05:34.480> if<00:05:35.480> you<00:05:35.870> are<00:05:36.230> too<00:05:36.410> comfortable<00:05:36.800> with

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
somehow if you are too comfortable with

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.900 
somehow if you are too comfortable with
that<00:05:38.080> it's<00:05:39.080> really<00:05:39.380> lightweight<00:05:39.620> as<00:05:40.010> well<00:05:40.040> it

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
that it's really lightweight as well it

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.730 
that it's really lightweight as well it
only<00:05:41.120> weighs<00:05:41.420> two<00:05:41.870> point<00:05:42.170> one<00:05:42.350> kilo<00:05:44.140> so<00:05:45.140> that's

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
only weighs two point one kilo so that's

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.170 
only weighs two point one kilo so that's
probably<00:05:46.040> another<00:05:46.220> reason<00:05:46.340> why<00:05:46.730> I<00:05:46.760> went<00:05:46.970> for

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
probably another reason why I went for

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.410 
probably another reason why I went for
it<00:05:47.210> as<00:05:47.360> well<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:47.800> because<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.090> light

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
it as well just because it is so light

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.940 
it as well just because it is so light
it<00:05:50.720> does<00:05:51.140> fit<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.680> bottom<00:05:51.920> of<00:05:52.040> bag<00:05:53.950> it

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
it does fit to the bottom of bag it

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.100 
it does fit to the bottom of bag it
wasn't<00:05:55.340> that<00:05:55.430> equally<00:05:55.940> expensive<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.810> only

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
wasn't that equally expensive I only

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.780 
wasn't that equally expensive I only
paid<00:05:57.350> one<00:05:57.470> hundred<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.890> fifty<00:05:58.250> five<00:05:58.490> dollars

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
paid one hundred and fifty five dollars

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:06.720 
paid one hundred and fifty five dollars
more<00:06:00.910> sorry<00:06:01.910> is<00:06:02.090> quite<00:06:02.300> good<00:06:02.540> as<00:06:03.140> in

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.630 

so<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.690> can't<00:06:07.990> sort<00:06:08.200> of<00:06:08.290> give<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.250> information

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
so I can't sort of give you information

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.280 
so I can't sort of give you information
on<00:06:09.910> now<00:06:10.120> or<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.390> can't<00:06:10.720> really<00:06:10.960> give<00:06:11.140> you<00:06:11.170> any

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
information on how what it's like sort

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.230 
information on how what it's like sort
of<00:06:14.290> after<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.680> downpour<00:06:14.950> either<00:06:15.430> because<00:06:15.940> I

haven't been in it whilst it's raining
or<00:06:18.970> so<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.050> morning<00:06:20.350> after<00:06:21.570> but<00:06:22.570> I<00:06:23.760> like<00:06:24.760> it<00:06:24.970> I

or so the morning after but I like it I

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.090 
or so the morning after but I like it I
think<00:06:25.210> it's<00:06:25.600> I<00:06:25.900> think<00:06:26.170> it's<00:06:26.350> quite<00:06:26.560> good<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.980> I

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
think it's I think it's quite good and I

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:41.580 
think it's I think it's quite good and I
think<00:06:27.160> for<00:06:27.910> a<00:06:28.950> first<00:06:37.620> I<00:06:39.960> went<00:06:40.960> for<00:06:41.230> a<00:06:41.260> tent

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
think for a first I went for a tent

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.550 
think for a first I went for a tent
rather<00:06:41.860> than<00:06:42.630> rather<00:06:43.630> than<00:06:43.870> a<00:06:43.900> hammock<00:06:44.290> or<00:06:44.470> a

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
rather than rather than a hammock or a

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.850 
rather than rather than a hammock or a
bivy<00:06:45.900> for<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:46.930> few<00:06:47.230> reasons

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
bivy for a few reasons

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.170 
bivy for a few reasons
and<00:06:48.010> I<00:06:48.910> mean<00:06:49.630> hammock<00:06:50.080> was<00:06:50.260> I<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:51.640> wanted<00:06:52.090> it

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
and I mean hammock was I I wanted it

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.730 
and I mean hammock was I I wanted it
because<00:06:52.360> I<00:06:52.900> don't<00:06:53.020> know<00:06:53.230> if<00:06:53.380> I'm<00:06:53.470> going<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.650> be

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
because I don't know if I'm going to be

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.410 
because I don't know if I'm going to be
someone<00:06:54.010> with<00:06:54.100> those<00:06:54.250> trees<00:06:56.370> so<00:06:57.370> that's<00:06:58.330> sort

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
someone with those trees so that's sort

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.780 
someone with those trees so that's sort
of<00:06:58.510> telling<00:06:58.750> me<00:06:58.840> I'm<00:06:58.930> a<00:06:58.990> hammock<00:06:59.350> plus<00:06:59.650> I<00:06:59.980> like

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
to be enclosed it sort of adds a little

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:13.980 
to be enclosed it sort of adds a little
bit<00:07:02.830> of<00:07:02.920> ground<00:07:11.970> it's<00:07:12.970> not<00:07:13.210> really<00:07:13.870> the

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990
