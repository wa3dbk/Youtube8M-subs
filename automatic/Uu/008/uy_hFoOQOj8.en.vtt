00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.469 
a very casual version of a blueberry
Earl<00:01:43.330> Grey<00:01:43.720> cake<00:01:44.409> with<00:01:45.009> lemon<00:01:45.280> frosting<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.210> a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
Earl Grey cake with lemon frosting and a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.389 
Earl Grey cake with lemon frosting and a
lemon<00:01:46.750> glaze<00:01:46.929> I<00:01:47.229> think<00:01:47.679> that<00:01:47.830> blueberry<00:01:48.220> with

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
lemon glaze I think that blueberry with

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.550 
lemon glaze I think that blueberry with
lemon<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.909> sort<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.509> more<00:01:49.810> exciting<00:01:50.140> thing

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
lemon is sort of a more exciting thing

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.919 
lemon is sort of a more exciting thing
you<00:01:50.920> actually<00:01:51.310> get<00:01:51.550> more<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.179> nuances<00:01:52.869> of

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
you actually get more of the nuances of

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.480 
you actually get more of the nuances of
the<00:01:53.140> fruit<00:01:53.380> same<00:01:53.740> thing<00:01:53.979> when<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.220> pair

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
the fruit same thing when you pair

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.040 
the fruit same thing when you pair
blueberries<00:01:55.060> with<00:01:55.179> their<00:01:55.330> old<00:01:55.450> ray<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:55.929> I'm

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
blueberries with their old ray so I'm

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.510 
blueberries with their old ray so I'm
hearing<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.440> with<00:01:56.530> whole<00:01:56.740> things<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.310> create

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
hearing it with whole things to create

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.370 
hearing it with whole things to create
this<00:01:57.610> desert<00:01:57.970> similar<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.630> like<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> pound<00:01:59.170> cake

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
this desert similar to like a pound cake

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.169 
this desert similar to like a pound cake
so<00:01:59.679> there's<00:01:59.979> nothing<00:02:00.069> too<00:02:00.369> crazy<00:02:00.580> nothing<00:02:01.030> you

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
so there's nothing too crazy nothing you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.490 
so there's nothing too crazy nothing you
can't<00:02:01.390> find<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.780> regular<00:02:02.020> grocery<00:02:02.200> store

actually a home baker that turned that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.370 
actually a home baker that turned that
idea<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.210> commitment<00:02:07.479> into<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.990> company
