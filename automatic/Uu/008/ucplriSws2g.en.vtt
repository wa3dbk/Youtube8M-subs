 Red Guard sanctions so teachers 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.839
 Petrovsky school speak about actions 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.599
 district administrations regarding 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.880
 work collective educators third 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.969
 month don't get 50 percent surcharge 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.010
 put by presidential decree Putin 's 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 eyes not seen and advance and for March 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.510
 the average salary of a teacher in Petrovsky 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 school 12,000 rubles with that kind of money 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250
 people only remain literally 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 words gnaw granite science continue 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.630
 topic 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.630
 Catherine of Sabyanin 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.710
 despite the holidays in Peter 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.840
 comprehensive school 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.780
 Red Guard district is full of life 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.790
 sports lovers are training the rest on 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
 extra classes such a craving for 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.140
 knowledge understandable School District has 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.270
 multimedia boards for interactive 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 what innovations of technology 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.590
 Any city can brag it 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.080
 perhaps the only plus in the current 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.660
 the work of teachers as it turned out their works 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.400
 not really appreciated in January we were paid 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.620
 incomplete wages for February 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.200
 we have not received in full today 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.580
 March 23, we did not buy chili for the mark 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.490
 pennies today are very big demands 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.229
 are presented to the teacher but it seems that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 our Red Guard district nobody 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.760
 thinks about how teachers and others 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 state employees live we communicate with colleagues 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.030
 from other regions of Crimea and we are told 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
 that they are all right 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.780
 average salary is about 12,000 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.350
 in accordance with the decision of the council 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.610
 ministers 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.290
 it should be 20 5554 rubles 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.090
 trade union organization had to learn 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.430
 all laws that are not learned to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.470
 Unfortunately, the head of our district at 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.390
 as they say teachers solve them 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.180
 problems in the district administration not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.909
 hurry instead of gingerbread already familiar 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.370
 for teachers whip such statements in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.110
 the address to the teachers do not want to work 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.440
 write a letter of resignation 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.480
 go to your place will come others I 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.940
 I think that this should not be from the mouth 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.239
 district leaders at the beginning of this year 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 15 years we reworked our billing 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.370
 taking into account the fifty percent premium 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.850
 which is provided by presidential decree 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.070
 number 193 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.240
 50 percent surcharge guarantees it 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.730
 Crimea state employees, including teachers 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.920
 average salary in the Russian Federation 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 maybe our leaders are not yet in 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.820
 course that we have the Russian Federation 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.850
 but the administration of the Red Guard 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.410
 district declare a problem know those 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.840
 more that this situation in the region 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.910
 annual fund shortage 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.920
 salaries of almost two hundred and twenty million 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.350
 rubles as the first deputy head says 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.050
 local administration of Vladimir Chertkov in 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.980
 payment documents made an error on 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.830
 present day 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.460
 payment for teaching staff goes for 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 subvention account from the autonomous republic 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.060
 Crimea 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.720
 today subvention comes to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.460
 us because of an error in the calculations 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.740
 comes to us in volume not enough 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.440
 February nucleophilicity came to the area 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.450
 an additional 11 million for 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.200
 recalculation is enough for them 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.130
 close one month in full pay 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 wages and now it will be closed 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:32.200
 in the month of March and on percent on February 30 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.490
 close according to Vladimir Cherkova 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.830
 administrations will do their best 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.080
 to relieve stress and completely 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.750
 settle with teachers in april but 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.670
 wage arrears and another half the budget 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 schools here's a real headache 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.390
 director's paper counted in 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.280
 District Education Department 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.580
 discretion to purchase 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.470
 medication in 2015 allocated as many as three 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.140
 one thousand nine hundred twenty four rubles 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.210
 that is, 6 rubles per student 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.550
 for example spending money on heating 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.740
 school may summer during the holidays in 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.170
 last month there were no funds for it 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.150
 I do not know what economist 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.000
 compiled this document but February 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.010
 month is the number 0 and in general 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.050
 when I turned to our financier and 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.000
 said guys you are strangers 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.520
 live in africa where one season of summer 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.560
 or we are currently in 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.690
 Russia where February is the winter month for 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.120
 which you have to pay for all these questions 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.920
 First of all, they do not say that 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.630
 if I'm not paying something in time 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.850
 then to me as a manager will 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.139
 penalties imposed 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.090
 fines scared and not with laws 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.639
 blue give because of the modernization of the dining room 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.310
 children for 4 months do not receive free 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.680
 power launch of new equipment and here 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.199
 catering unit in operation suspended 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.849
 so decided in the district administration 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.650
 Teachers tell it all confidently. 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.020
 Headmaster Tatyana Koshevaya 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.800
 may adversely affect the receipt 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.360
 licenses 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.509
 we must give necessarily 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.009
 job confirmation fire services 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.770
 medical services imagine 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.909
 the school does not get today either 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.729
 penny not some of the budget but today 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.319
 should prepare like that 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.500
 requires regulatory framework 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.800
 Russian Federation recently in 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.689
 I often hear my team 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.169
 phrases Red Guard sanctions 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.770
 or they say even the phrase 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.750
 Red Guard gum 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.550
 the labor collective of the Peter school is already 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.080
 sent a letter to the president of Russia 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.110
 Vladimir Putin and the head of the republic 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.659
 Sergey Aksenov teachers hope that their 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.610
 requests for help will be heard and if 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.039
 not even to the Red Guard district 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.960
 The desired Crimean spring came, then they 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.029
 ready to wait for the Crimean summer
