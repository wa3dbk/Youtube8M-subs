great strategy to rush around with that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
great strategy to rush around with that
setup<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> people

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
setup you can really get a lot of people

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
setup you can really get a lot of people
off-guard<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.370> camp<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.000> right

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
off-guard but if you can camp just right

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.380 
off-guard but if you can camp just right
you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> Kimbell<00:00:57.000> magnums

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you can get them and the Kimbell magnums

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
you can get them and the Kimbell magnums
let's<00:00:57.629> talk<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.989> those<00:00:58.170> babies<00:00:58.559> cuz<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.920> have

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
let's talk about those babies cuz I have

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.200 
let's talk about those babies cuz I have
not<00:00:59.250> used<00:00:59.460> those<00:00:59.730> yet

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
not used those yet

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
not used those yet
pretty<00:01:00.780> much<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> akimbo<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> Magnum

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
pretty much when you akimbo the Magnum

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
pretty much when you akimbo the Magnum
you<00:01:02.670> decrease<00:01:03.120> its<00:01:03.359> range<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.350> have

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you decrease its range because they have

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.730 
you decrease its range because they have
no<00:01:04.769> accuracy<00:01:05.600> akimbo<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> range<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> do

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
no accuracy akimbo but the range you do

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
no accuracy akimbo but the range you do
cover<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> akimbo<00:01:08.640> magnums<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> lot

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
cover with the akimbo magnums is a lot

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
cover with the akimbo magnums is a lot
more<00:01:09.840> destructive<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> better<00:01:10.680> than<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
more destructive and better than just a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
more destructive and better than just a
single<00:01:12.090> Magnum<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.530> advice

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
single Magnum so pretty much my advice

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
single Magnum so pretty much my advice
easy<00:01:14.549> Kimbo<00:01:14.880> magnums<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.509> you're<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.780> use

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
easy Kimbo magnums if you're gonna use

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
easy Kimbo magnums if you're gonna use
the<00:01:16.049> magnums<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.729> rely

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the magnums at all and then just rely

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
the magnums at all and then just rely
rely<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.960> cipher<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> rest<00:01:19.770> because

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
rely on your cipher for the rest because

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
rely on your cipher for the rest because
that<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.700> how<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> should<00:01:21.030> be

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that is how it should be

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.649 
that is how it should be
I<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.830> prefer<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.400> handguns<00:01:24.000> instead

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I really prefer to use handguns instead

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
I really prefer to use handguns instead
