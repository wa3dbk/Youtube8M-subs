00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 a design 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.940
 in you 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.839
 but needing a lot of patience 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.839
 obviously with a lot of patience 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:04.199
 a lilac color of 211 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.700
 it's called in the videos 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.780
 the earth 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.850
 transparent we are going to need that no 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.620
 have more paper 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 I recommend you right now going up 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.530
 series you neglect to follow eros if 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 they are wrong they were fifteen more did not happen 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.190
 nothing scissors 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 and nothing more than the paper appointment 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.850
 the lens a lot I love this heart 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.540
 about cute you can combine a color that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 you want 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.990
 you have to have me once 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.390
 good girls let's start statesmen 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 united that are so good at the beginning and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.450
 well I painted myself with this color that already 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.049
 they saw 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.689
 4 together and the other with this color that 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.000
 happened to get to painted subjects why did 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.750
 das paints a Danish while painting yesterday 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.030
 because to dress you to expect that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 very good but very good to the consumer and 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 there we passed the little hearts 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.200
 we use it has to be very well dry 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.910
 that's why I recommend others paint if 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.050
 does not have trouble a day before after 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.330
 other days it is simply in the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.330
 hearts it's much easier to me them 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.030
 I recommend it is thunder and I paint them for 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.810
 they are removed I am and I also became 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:36.459
 this hand and well let's use it with the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.850
 Band-aid if we open it once we have 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.890
 our band-aid 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.290
 let's do with a band-aid we're going to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.100
 to be able to make two hearts and with this 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.100
 part and with this one 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.730
 and well let's grab this piece of paper 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.550
 well and we 're not going to throw it at all but a 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.790
 little bit 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.720
 until there is a little bit of this 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.890
 like cotton if what you have 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.320
 and we are going to cut this is so that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.140
 then when we make our hearts 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.090
 we can take it out more easily and good 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.620
 to make our hearts go to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.620
 fold this part well 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.560
 and we talk about it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.870
 it does not matter if there is someone who edited 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 nothing we folded we left the part in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.130
 white alone and now you can 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.690
 draw a half of a pencil 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.000
 little heart so I can cut 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.720
 we have the whole heart but I 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 I'm just going to cut it like this and now 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.640
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.250
 take it off and stick it on our shore and 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.200
 well I stuck it and I stay like this and now 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.750
 let's paint 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.530
 I think you have the heart and I 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.200
 uia rose to be painting a color 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.300
 silver that is this and good once 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.810
 I know we passed the other hand and you 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.880
 they see the hand that is so necessary and now 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.220
 let's do the same in case it was not seen 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.400
 all right 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.780
 on the other nail with the band-aid after 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.890
 let's use the tape we do it like that 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.049
 we cut there just to modulate the 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.690
 part of the band-aid in two leaving the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.290
 white paper outside 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.290
 A) Yes 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.889
 as if we're going to the middle and now they can 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.460
 draw with a pencil 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.219
 the little heart or cut simply me 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.949
 I stay like this and we take it out we stick it in the 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.930
 nail we stick the little heart well and I 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.240
 be painting the color pink and we 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.310
 it stays like this 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.150
 this as fun in mind because 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.150
 you can paint 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.960
 as painted without fear and good what 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.460
 let's use the tape that passes now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.430
 look at the little bit I feel like I have 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.560
 terrible problem remains the same with there 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.919
 more complicated feels paper can 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.360
 use car interests but what happens 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.819
 has enough glue is then 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.720
 like you have to get out of the glue 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.240
 we can speak the truth 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.790
 a 7 mouth and we will remove the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.130
 glue we just paste it and 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.890
 we remove paste we throw it to 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.290
 get me out this is necessary that they do 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.600
 if you are not going to paint out more 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.250
 be dry as I recommend that you 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.920
 they take out the glue a little bit so 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.870
 less or with a cloth they remove it like that in 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:39.200
 the problem and well let's do what 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.200
 same we are going to cut a bit like that 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.890
 and let's go 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.570
 fold it I hope it happens let's leave 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.700
 a little tip so that later 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:53.280
 easier to take it off 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.280
 so 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.870
 makers inc 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 Y 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:37.810
 despite the good girls has been 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:37.810
 no battery in the paint well 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.389
 let's wait half an hour a little more if 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.419
 they can when they have to july come on 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.210
 to slowly remove the girl who has 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:53.120
 glue obviously but let's try 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.060
 to do show batiera to try 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.839
 to take it off but they will see that 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:06.569
 lifting up 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:06.569
 but raising you 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.219
 again low glue take off more 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:20.409
 easy 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.499
 and when you see 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.029
 and well we are with our hands and 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.919
 also apply the little heart for that 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:28.360
 advance a bit and all edge nothing 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.419
 more and ready 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.360
 let 's hope it's a little come paint and 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:35.889
 let's pass them transparent and this is 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.809
 I hope all you like girls 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:40.300
