00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
better there's quite a contingent of

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.110 
better there's quite a contingent of
people<00:00:57.949> out<00:00:58.039> there<00:00:58.070> who<00:00:58.370> think<00:00:58.640> there's<00:00:58.879> an

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
people out there who think there's an

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.889 
people out there who think there's an
eminent<00:01:00.110> collapse<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.010> dollar<00:01:01.899> that's

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
eminent collapse of the dollar that's

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.779 
eminent collapse of the dollar that's
gonna<00:01:03.170> happen<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.620> next<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:04.160> know<00:01:04.190> one<00:01:04.580> to

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
gonna happen the next you know one to

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.359 
gonna happen the next you know one to
five<00:01:05.149> or<00:01:05.330> six<00:01:05.539> years<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.250> mathematically<00:01:07.250> it

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
five or six years and mathematically it

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.520 
five or six years and mathematically it
seems<00:01:07.580> very<00:01:07.640> likely<00:01:07.850> because<00:01:08.780> what<00:01:09.380> we're

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
seems very likely because what we're

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.469 
seems very likely because what we're
doing<00:01:09.770> right<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:09.950> with<00:01:10.490> all<00:01:10.939> these<00:01:11.180> bailouts

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
doing right now with all these bailouts

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.060 
doing right now with all these bailouts
and<00:01:11.780> things<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.470> simply<00:01:12.860> not

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
and things just is simply not

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.280 
and things just is simply not
sustainable<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.150> debt<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:14.750> have<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.049> not

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
sustainable the debt that we have is not

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.890 
sustainable the debt that we have is not
sustainable<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.760> think<00:01:16.939> that's<00:01:17.270> why<00:01:17.570> we're

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
sustainable so I think that's why we're

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.320 
sustainable so I think that's why we're
so<00:01:18.080> successful<00:01:18.770> as<00:01:19.040> they<00:01:19.310> as<00:01:19.549> a<00:01:19.610> development

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
so successful as they as a development

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.719 
so successful as they as a development
and<00:01:20.630> as<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> community<00:01:21.070> because<00:01:22.070> not<00:01:22.250> only<00:01:22.280> do

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
and as a community because not only do

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.880 
and as a community because not only do
we<00:01:22.880> have<00:01:22.990> about<00:01:23.990> seven<00:01:24.320> hundred<00:01:24.350> seventy

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
we have about seven hundred seventy

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.429 
we have about seven hundred seventy
