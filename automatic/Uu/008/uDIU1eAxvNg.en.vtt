00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
latest video basically this isn't going

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.140 
latest video basically this isn't going
to<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.890> all<00:00:08.069> too<00:00:08.250> much<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.940> gameplay

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
to be all too much about the gameplay

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.839 
to be all too much about the gameplay
although<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.780> am<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.469> beautiful<00:00:11.280> yellow

Lamborghini<00:00:12.540> Gallardo<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.679> race<00:00:13.889> but

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Lamborghini Gallardo in this race but

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.430 
Lamborghini Gallardo in this race but
that's<00:00:14.460> not<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.000> topic<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.719> video<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that's not the topic of the video the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.859 
that's not the topic of the video the
main<00:00:16.680> topic<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> video<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> Forza<00:00:18.539> horizon

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
main topic of the video is Forza horizon

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.800 
main topic of the video is Forza horizon
and<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> fact<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.039> Forza<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.880> Forza

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and in fact it's not Forza it's Forza

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.970 
and in fact it's not Forza it's Forza
forts<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.680> horizon<00:00:24.109> but<00:00:25.109> anyway<00:00:25.529> that's<00:00:25.890> beside

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
forts a horizon but anyway that's beside

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240 
forts a horizon but anyway that's beside
the<00:00:26.220> point<00:00:26.340> um<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.689> main<00:00:27.869> topic<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> physics

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the point um the main topic is physics

blog a couple of days ago that kind of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
blog a couple of days ago that kind of
talks<00:01:26.250> about<00:01:26.689> what<00:01:27.979> what<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.100> be

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
talks about what what would be

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
talks about what what would be
interesting<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.060> Forza<00:01:30.420> horizon<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
interesting to see in Forza horizon and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
interesting to see in Forza horizon and
the<00:01:31.049> first<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the first thing the first thing that I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
the first thing the first thing that I
talked<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> houses<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.640> any<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
talked about is houses if you if any of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
talked about is houses if you if any of
you<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.150> played<00:01:36.299> test<00:01:36.659> drive<00:01:36.840> unlimited<00:01:36.930> 2

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you have played test drive unlimited 2

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.420 
you have played test drive unlimited 2
you'll<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.790> could<00:01:38.970> buy<00:01:39.119> houses

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
you'll know that you could buy houses

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
you'll know that you could buy houses
slightly<00:01:41.430> customize<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
slightly customize them and see your

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.819 
slightly customize them and see your
cars<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.710> garage<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.570> stuff<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
cars in your garage and stuff like that

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.749 
cars in your garage and stuff like that
but<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.990> think<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.770> cool<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
but I think that it would be cool that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.069 
but I think that it would be cool that
if<00:01:51.030> forza<00:01:51.509> horizon<00:01:51.710> had<00:01:52.710> houses<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:54.079> weren't

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
if forza horizon had houses that weren't

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
if forza horizon had houses that weren't
like<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.649> could<00:01:55.920> buy<00:01:56.100> houses<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:57.060> they

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like you could buy houses but they

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
like you could buy houses but they
wouldn't<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.540> pre-made<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> could<00:01:58.770> actually

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
wouldn't be pre-made you could actually

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
wouldn't be pre-made you could actually
decide<00:01:59.430> where<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> wanted<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.210> house<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.630> be

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
decide where you wanted your house to be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.800 
decide where you wanted your house to be
and<00:02:01.430> decide<00:02:02.430> exactly<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> wanted<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and decide exactly what you wanted it to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
and decide exactly what you wanted it to
look<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> rooms<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.610> many

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
look like you know the rooms how many

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.600

stories<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.689> garage<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.459> add

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
stories the garage I think it would add

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.590 
stories the garage I think it would add
a<00:02:08.640> whole<00:02:09.030> new

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
a whole new

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.760 
a whole new
to<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.900> gameplay<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.590> maybe<00:02:12.260> maybe<00:02:13.260> maybe

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
to the gameplay and maybe maybe maybe

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860 
to the gameplay and maybe maybe maybe
it'll<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.460> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> game<00:02:14.820> maybe<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.600> don't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it'll be in the game maybe not I don't

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.790 
it'll be in the game maybe not I don't

fuel system is is something that
something<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.640> hard<00:02:44.910> core

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
something that I can see the hard core

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.380 
something that I can see the hard core
audience<00:02:46.080> wanting<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.580> also<00:02:47.850> something<00:02:48.270> that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
audience wanting but also something that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.610 
audience wanting but also something that
I<00:02:48.510> could<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.310> potentially<00:02:50.310> driving<00:02:50.850> away

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I could see potentially driving away

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.560 
I could see potentially driving away
newcomers<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.340> you're<00:02:54.150> driving

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
newcomers because if you're driving

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.990 
newcomers because if you're driving
around<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.830> forget<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.430> you're<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
around and you forget that you're on a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.910 
around and you forget that you're on a
dynamic<00:02:57.630> fuel<00:02:57.870> system<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.410> your<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.710> out<00:02:58.830> in

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
dynamic fuel system and your way out in

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.140 
dynamic fuel system and your way out in
the<00:02:58.950> middle<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> desert<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.850> run<00:03:00.030> out

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the middle of the desert and you run out

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.840 
the middle of the desert and you run out
of<00:03:00.180> fuel<00:03:00.450> you're<00:03:01.410> kind<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.830> screwed<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.760> know

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
of fuel you're kind of screwed you know

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.230 
of fuel you're kind of screwed you know
you're<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.990> screwed<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.070> think<00:03:05.610> that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
you're kind of screwed so I think that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.770 
you're kind of screwed so I think that
maybe<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.500> cool<00:03:07.770> idea<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.780> you

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
maybe it would be a cool idea if you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
maybe it would be a cool idea if you
could<00:03:10.020> actually<00:03:10.260> turn<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> dynamic<00:03:11.910> fuel

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
could actually turn the dynamic fuel

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.990 
could actually turn the dynamic fuel
system<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.780> or<00:03:13.200> off<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.340> assists

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
system on or off kind of like assists

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.480 
system on or off kind of like assists
but<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.590> could<00:03:16.740> decide<00:03:17.070> if<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.310> wanted

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
but like you could decide if you wanted

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.520 
but like you could decide if you wanted
it<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.820> fully<00:03:18.090> realistic<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:19.290> all

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
it to be fully realistic like all

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.950 
it to be fully realistic like all
assists<00:03:20.100> off<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> dynamic<00:03:21.300> fuel<00:03:21.510> system

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
assists off with a dynamic fuel system

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.720 
assists off with a dynamic fuel system
and<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.770> know<00:03:22.890> when<00:03:23.040> your<00:03:23.160> fuel<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.490> getting

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
and you know when your fuel is getting

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.980 
and you know when your fuel is getting
low<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.150> would<00:03:24.270> have<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
low all you would have to do is go to a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.660 
low all you would have to do is go to a
gas<00:03:25.260> station<00:03:25.290> maybe<00:03:26.040> that's<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.430> little<00:03:26.460> too

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
gas station maybe that's a little too

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.060 
gas station maybe that's a little too
realistic<00:03:27.420> since<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.320> know<00:03:28.380> they<00:03:28.650> want<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.980> to

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
realistic since I know they want it to

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.540 
realistic since I know they want it to
be<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.430> little<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.650> more<00:03:31.950> arcadey

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
be a little more a little more arcadey

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.860 
be a little more a little more arcadey
than<00:03:32.880> normal<00:03:33.360> than<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.500> normal<00:03:34.920> forza

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
than normal than the normal forza

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.650 
than normal than the normal forza
because<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.990> Forza<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.500> all<00:03:37.770> motor<00:03:38.220> sport<00:03:38.670> but

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
because it Forza is all motor sport but

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.280 
because it Forza is all motor sport but
I<00:03:39.980> think<00:03:40.980> personally<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.510> dynamic<00:03:43.050> fuel

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
I think personally that a dynamic fuel

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.990 
I think personally that a dynamic fuel
system<00:03:43.650> would<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.950> sort<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.460> cool<00:03:44.760> little

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
system would be sort of a cool little

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.850 
system would be sort of a cool little
idea<00:03:46.760> now<00:03:47.760> some<00:03:48.420> new<00:03:48.570> cars<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.260> also<00:03:49.620> been

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
idea now some new cars have also been

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.170 
idea now some new cars have also been
confirmed<00:03:50.580> for<00:03:51.020> example<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.500> mosler<00:03:53.040> mt<00:03:53.550> 900
