regardless I'm gonna answer your
question<00:00:39.920> what<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.250> he<00:00:41.399> needs<00:00:41.610> though<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
question what I think he needs though I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
question what I think he needs though I
think<00:00:42.059> he<00:00:42.329> means<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.710> snaps<00:00:44.100> on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
think he means pretty much the snaps on

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.110 
think he means pretty much the snaps on
the<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> snapback<00:00:45.440> about<00:00:47.030> where<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the back of the snapback about where it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.619 
the back of the snapback about where it
goes<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> usually<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.829> snap<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
goes and usually my snap is just like I

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
goes and usually my snap is just like I
count<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> end<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.070> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
count by the end of it so it's like one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
count by the end of it so it's like one
so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> wear<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.690> snap<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.770> comes<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> snap

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so I wear one snap when it comes to snap

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
so I wear one snap when it comes to snap
backs<00:00:56.989> three<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.109> four<00:00:58.440> uh<00:00:59.090> I<00:01:00.090> guess<00:01:00.960> your

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
backs three or four uh I guess your

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.609 
backs three or four uh I guess your
heads<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.649> huge<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
heads really huge so I really want to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.160 
heads really huge so I really want to
know<00:01:05.000> but<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.330> doesn't<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.630> make<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
know but it doesn't really make the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
know but it doesn't really make the
person<00:01:07.500> stupid<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.010> retarded<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.700> doesn't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
person stupid or retarded that doesn't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.280 
person stupid or retarded that doesn't
really<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:11.070> doesn't<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.630> relate<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> your

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
really it doesn't really relate to your

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
really it doesn't really relate to your
wearing<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> how<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.460> snapback<00:01:14.850> looks

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
wearing of how your snapback looks

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.800 
wearing of how your snapback looks
actually<00:01:15.380> personally<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.560> people<00:01:16.979> just

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
actually personally I think people just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
actually personally I think people just
they<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.170> understand<00:01:19.950> sometimes

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they don't really understand sometimes

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
they don't really understand sometimes
how<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:22.170> works<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
how it works all you do just it's just

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
how it works all you do just it's just
wearing<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> hat<00:01:24.180> guys<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.229> hard

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
wearing a hat guys it's not that hard

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
wearing a hat guys it's not that hard
but<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.670> boys<00:01:26.909> hopefully<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> answers

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
but the way boys hopefully just answers

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.179 
but the way boys hopefully just answers
your<00:01:27.930> question<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:30.799> don't<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.040> don't

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
head is bigger or smaller since you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.210 
head is bigger or smaller since you
asked<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> video<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.470> mean<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.070> video

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

me through YouTube and I think it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.070 
me through YouTube and I think it
doesn't<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.270> anything<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> do<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.990> at

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
doesn't have anything to do with it at

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.160 
doesn't have anything to do with it at
all<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.090> feel<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.600> your<00:02:36.810> because
