00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
pineapple it should be able to just

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:05.770 
pineapple it should be able to just
easily<00:00:55.830> twist<00:00:56.830> off<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.840> greenery<00:00:59.230> top

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
all right here we go set this aside for

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
all right here we go set this aside for
eating<00:01:10.910> later

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.000 

all<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.620> it's<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.770> part

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
all right so this is a it's the part

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.910 
all right so this is a it's the part
that<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> inside<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> pineapple<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.920> each

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that was inside the pineapple here each

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.430 
that was inside the pineapple here each
of<00:01:22.979> these<00:01:23.159> leaves<00:01:23.940> at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> bottom<00:01:24.570> should

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
of these leaves at the bottom should

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.740 
of these leaves at the bottom should
just<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.830> able<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.220> peel<00:01:26.460> away<00:01:29.300> as<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.479> peel

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just be able to peel away as we peel

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.200 
just be able to peel away as we peel
away<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:32.369> should<00:01:32.430> start<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:35.210> roots

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
away you should start to see some roots

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
away you should start to see some roots
that<00:01:36.509> were<00:01:36.660> underneath<00:01:37.050> these<00:01:37.229> leaves<00:01:40.220> fairly

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that were underneath these leaves fairly

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.420 
that were underneath these leaves fairly
easy<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> pull<00:01:41.790> away<00:01:41.909> gently<00:01:46.130> how<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
easy to pull away gently how much of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.630 
easy to pull away gently how much of
that<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.940> peel<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.460> see

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that do you have to peel we don't see

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.170 
that do you have to peel we don't see
roots<00:01:50.880> anymore<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:52.580> haven't<00:01:53.580> seen<00:01:53.789> any<00:01:53.970> words

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
roots anymore I haven't seen any words

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.920 

see<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.729> little<00:02:06.880> brown<00:02:07.210> things<00:02:07.540> I<00:02:07.720> think

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
see the little brown things I think

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:26.100 
see the little brown things I think
we're<00:02:08.080> getting<00:02:08.349> into<00:02:08.619> some<00:02:08.649> roots

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.710 

if<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.680> want<00:02:26.860> more<00:02:27.010> details<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> see<00:02:28.420> what

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
if you want more details and to see what

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.140 
if you want more details and to see what
one<00:02:29.650> looks<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:30.010> after<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> few<00:02:30.790> months<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
one looks like after a few months of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.410 
one looks like after a few months of
growth<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.990> see<00:02:32.200> practices<00:02:32.860> video<00:02:33.210> we'll<00:02:34.210> put

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
growth go see practices video we'll put

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.320 
growth go see practices video we'll put
a<00:02:34.450> link<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.370> bar<00:02:36.370> underneath<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.180> video

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
a link in the bar underneath the video

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:52.650 
a link in the bar underneath the video
here

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.610 

I'm<00:02:53.140> not<00:02:53.350> seeing<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.890> nice<00:02:54.100> long<00:02:55.080> curly<00:02:56.080> roots

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
I'm not seeing the nice long curly roots

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.060 
I'm not seeing the nice long curly roots
that<00:02:56.920> practice<00:02:57.460> had<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.920> think

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
that practice had but I don't think

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.140 
that practice had but I don't think
that's<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.430> big<00:03:00.610> problem<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:04.000> will

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
that's a big problem I think this will

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.530 
that's a big problem I think this will
grow<00:03:04.860> anyway<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.210> little

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
grow anyway it's just these little

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:22.060 
grow anyway it's just these little
stubby<00:03:07.930> roots

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.690 

I'll<00:03:23.070> stop<00:03:23.520> here<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.530> think<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.890> little<00:03:26.130> brown

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I'll stop here I think the little brown

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.270 
I'll stop here I think the little brown
spots<00:03:27.210> are<00:03:27.720> where<00:03:28.140> roots<00:03:28.440> are<00:03:28.650> starting<00:03:29.160> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
spots are where roots are starting to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.120 
spots are where roots are starting to
grow<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:31.380> I'm<00:03:31.470> thinking<00:03:31.770> that's<00:03:31.920> where<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
grow so I'm thinking that's where the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.559 
grow so I'm thinking that's where the
roots<00:03:32.310> are<00:03:32.490> gonna<00:03:32.550> come<00:03:32.820> from

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.770 

I<00:03:38.659> just<00:03:39.319> picked<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.769> pot<00:03:40.099> for<00:03:40.780> planting

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
I just picked this pot for planting

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.589 
I just picked this pot for planting
because<00:03:42.109> it's<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.530> biggest<00:03:42.859> pot<00:03:43.219> I<00:03:43.609> currently

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
because it's the biggest pot I currently

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.780 
because it's the biggest pot I currently
own<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.439> isn't<00:03:45.769> being<00:03:45.920> used<00:03:46.040> for<00:03:46.459> something

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
own that isn't being used for something

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.089 
own that isn't being used for something
else

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.330 

we're<00:03:51.310> just<00:03:51.489> gonna<00:03:51.640> bury<00:03:52.569> it<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:54.040> up<00:03:54.189> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
we're just gonna bury it just up to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:08.640 
we're just gonna bury it just up to
above<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.909> fleshy<00:03:55.180> part<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.749> I've<00:03:56.019> exposed

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.410 

I<00:04:08.680> don't<00:04:09.160> think<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.520> want<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.790> bury<00:04:10.000> any<00:04:10.240> of

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
I don't think you want to bury any of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:20.699 
I don't think you want to bury any of
the<00:04:10.540> leaves

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.129 

according<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.549> practice<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.180> video<00:04:22.569> it's

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
according to practice this video it's

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.409 
according to practice this video it's
normal<00:04:23.650> for<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> first<00:04:23.949> couple<00:04:24.490> weeks<00:04:24.520> for<00:04:25.300> it

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
normal for the first couple weeks for it

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.779 
normal for the first couple weeks for it
to<00:04:25.539> look<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.840> little<00:04:27.000> less<00:04:28.000> than<00:04:28.360> alive<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:30.699> he

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
to look a little less than alive and he

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.510 
to look a little less than alive and he
says<00:04:30.970> that's<00:04:31.180> because<00:04:31.330> all<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.530> energy<00:04:33.220> is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
says that's because all the energy is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.469 
says that's because all the energy is
going<00:04:34.090> towards<00:04:34.720> establishing<00:04:34.949> new<00:04:35.949> roots<00:04:36.479> and

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
going towards establishing new roots and

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.689 
going towards establishing new roots and
then<00:04:37.599> after<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> few<00:04:38.169> weeks<00:04:38.430> they'll<00:04:39.430> start

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
then after a few weeks they'll start

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.360 
then after a few weeks they'll start
growing<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.120> nice<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.800> then<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.979> can<00:04:42.160> just

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
growing up nice and then you can just

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.320 
growing up nice and then you can just
trim<00:04:42.639> back<00:04:42.819> the<00:04:44.550> leaves<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:45.729> look<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.180> little

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
trim back the leaves that look a little

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.749 
trim back the leaves that look a little
dead<00:04:47.160> about<00:04:48.160> time<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.919> you<00:04:51.039> know<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.310> goal<00:04:51.550> is

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
dead about time so you know this goal is

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.629 
dead about time so you know this goal is
eventually<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.569> might<00:04:52.900> grow<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.590> pineapple<00:04:54.250> in

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
eventually it might grow a pineapple in

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.060 
eventually it might grow a pineapple in
the<00:04:54.789> middle
