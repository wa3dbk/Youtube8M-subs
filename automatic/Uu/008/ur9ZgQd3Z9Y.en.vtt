00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello now I want to show you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.360
 another dish of cinnamon kitchen 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.260
 that is, panchan to which are prepared from 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.900
 dried fish 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.240
 here we have dried fish here I am already 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 would and put on the pan means she 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.609
 Looks like this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.160
 dried pressed fish she is lightly 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 so sweet in principle possible and even 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.980
 eat in this form that is, it is a little bit 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 sweetened so dry in principle those 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.649
 who likes him this either here such 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 snacks principle can be so 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.320
 use but we will now cook 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 precisely panchan and he such quite simply 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.969
 preparing 1 for the desired section of this fish 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 Here are such small pieces break 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.199
 that then was in the future I'm comfortable 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 eat it so here we have fish stew already 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.739
 placed too gently cook or 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.549
 it is necessary that then there was no inconvenience here 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.240
 yong to you giving yes here so fish a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.020
 dry 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 so first you need to grind it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 we place it as follows 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 pour some water 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 since the volume can be taken arbitrary 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 the volume of fish to that water is also in principle 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 so itâ€™s possible to take too much 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 there was a lot but that was enough for 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.890
 its softening too literally too 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 need to mean now we pour water 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 I poured boiled water here we give means 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 fish this dried boil and busts well 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.240
 so that it boils so that it softens 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.780
 Now we'll see this later when 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 accommodate 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:15.310
 while you can put my taste 40 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:18.160
 garlic is ready already can be put 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.970
 two so small 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.970
 teaspoons 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 see here I have a fever on him but who 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.209
 people decide to skip 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.209
 this dish is cooked very very quickly 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.390
 stir to 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.970
 still less here is the top layer too 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.630
 I am trying to water a second longer, and so 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.630
 softened 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.959
 too one-time not that is too 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.290
 much vadim before pouring can not 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 It can not be named here as well to moderate 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.349
 consistency of it bring to such 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.349
 the plan is not too swollen yet 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:34.569
 started where at all we are waiting for the screen 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.569
 a little mustard 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.710
 why quite a lot of that is difficult 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:56.330
 don't need misfortune 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:04:02.450
 fish garlic and we have a sauce which 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:08.180

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.170
 this sauce 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.090
 Well, everywhere at different manufacturers like 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.670
 different composition of the house at this 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.120

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.410
 bit horrible place, in principle, still 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.480
