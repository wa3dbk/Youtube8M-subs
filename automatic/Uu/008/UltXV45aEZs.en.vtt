 top lace top choice as we prefer 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.750
 his idea is just like that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.270
 it may not be all your sizes yes 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.070
 the hears but this also looks in 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.229

 but come on then only prongs have the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.189
 wanted to collapse one thing 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.189
 hold on to and that is 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.430
 the emily steelseries cyberia version 2 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.170

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.990
 empty box is or something 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.790
 is also just in a collision 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.110
 weird that there are 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.110
 gamersnet point that way 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.090
 and he was stuck here and viewing what is 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.530
 this it is just really how you do ipod 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.240
 whores from your book would go like that 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 difficult with a lot of competition 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.980
 loud sound I hear nothing more about 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.540
