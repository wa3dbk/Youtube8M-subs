00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.770
 my name is half that I'm 27 years old I'm 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.240
 executive assistant which 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.859
 I'm worried that I've seen 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 clippings or and talked about 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.340
 close totally at night compared to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.639
 the mass of work they had to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.750
 make 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.059
 because I really want to know 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.460
 if there is a need to do as many 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:26.099
 work on this line hello I am 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 vanessa hello enchanted nicolas if i 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.429
 did you come by night it's because 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 that these moments then legier which one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.369
 do our work you need to know about 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 rer d 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 there are half a million travelers 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.860
 circulate every day we set ourselves a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.379
 very simple rule that is to say achieve 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 the maximum of works while hindering the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.690
 less possible customers 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.489
 what you need to know is that since 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
 2014 investment for the works has 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.579
 doubled every year until 2020 we have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.289
 more than a billion euros that we 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.000
 will be affected and we have set ourselves a 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 simple rule is to bring the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.449
 works for a maximum of travelers 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 quickly benefit from rejuvenation 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.379
 of the network you will see on the map 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.120
 the priority will be red and black 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 so half of my line and in red and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.539
 black are indeed the most 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 borrowed then our method is from 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.799
 concentrate most of the work on this 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.390
 red and black stretch so that the most 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.439
 large number of customers who feel 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.439
 quickly the effect of an improvement 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 we are in the heart of the hyper- dense zone 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.009
 this is where we will prioritize our work 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 regeneration 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.479
 we replace the switches the ballast 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 the Latinization catenary is therefore the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 goal is to make a replacement 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.009
 massive of our elements 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 as an example on regeneration this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 that we did the three nights 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630
 last and what we're going 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.040
 start doing next week again 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 it's all refurbishing it's by his 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 must we remove and 2000 biya I put 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.210
 side I replace then I saw 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.400
 the works were mostly done 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.229
 quite a short time that made me 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.490
 much impressed is the quantity 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 work to be done 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.250
 you have to know that while you 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.390
 sleep there are thousands of people who 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.790
 are working on the rejuvenation of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 network when we can not realize them 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.180
 night at the program this work 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.020
 mainly on weekends or during 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.820
 School holidays 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.320
 why not clearly impossible at this 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.050
 moment we are getting organized to 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.090
 your service means of substitution 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.920
 if i have a review to send to sncf 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.729
 maybe it's a little bit more 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.020
 explanations 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.789
 because a lot of people are 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.590
 unhappy but they do not understand 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.590
 the need to actually make 7 rebounds 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.100
