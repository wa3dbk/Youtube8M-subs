00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
you see it has like these little

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.310 
you see it has like these little
indentions<00:03:49.740> like<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.540> imitate<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.750> lash<00:03:51.960> line

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
indentions like to imitate a lash line

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.140 
indentions like to imitate a lash line
well<00:03:52.860> where<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.190> put<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.490> eyeliner<00:03:53.910> on

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
well where you put the eyeliner on

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.690 
well where you put the eyeliner on
because<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.080> follow<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
because you can just follow that the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.360 
because you can just follow that the
eyeliner<00:03:57.150> gets<00:03:57.420> stuck<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.140> there<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.620> let<00:03:59.220> me

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
eyeliner gets stuck in there and let me

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.490 
eyeliner gets stuck in there and let me
just<00:03:59.400> tell<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.240> almost<00:04:00.540> impossible<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
just tell you it's almost impossible to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.650 
just tell you it's almost impossible to
get<00:04:01.710> off<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.700> then<00:04:02.850> sometimes<00:04:03.330> you'll<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.600> a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
get off and then sometimes you'll have a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.600 
get off and then sometimes you'll have a
little<00:04:03.750> bit<00:04:03.960> of<00:04:04.140> lipstick<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:04.950> suck<00:04:05.460> in

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
little bit of lipstick it and suck in

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.340 
little bit of lipstick it and suck in
here<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.270> find<00:04:06.570> that's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.990> little<00:04:07.170> bit

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
here but I find that's a little bit

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.100 
here but I find that's a little bit
easier<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.800> get<00:04:08.100> off<00:04:08.430> then<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.690> on

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
easier to get off then this is and on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.140 
easier to get off then this is and on
line<00:04:10.410> they<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.800> really<00:04:11.010> say<00:04:11.370> what<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.910> clean

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
line they don't really say what to clean

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.120 
line they don't really say what to clean
it<00:04:12.270> with<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.690> have<00:04:12.810> used<00:04:13.200> like<00:04:13.440> baby<00:04:13.770> wipes

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
Vaseline and I've used olive oil because

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.590 
Vaseline and I've used olive oil because
