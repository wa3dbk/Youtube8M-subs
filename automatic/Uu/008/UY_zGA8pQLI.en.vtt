the problem and his response to it
Euthyphro<00:00:21.600> dilemma<00:00:21.630> did<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:22.529> attack<00:00:22.830> on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
Euthyphro dilemma did an attack on

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
Euthyphro dilemma did an attack on
premise<00:00:23.310> 1<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:24.300> seems<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> show<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.080> God

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
premise 1 it seems to show that God

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
premise 1 it seems to show that God
cannot<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> foundation<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.550> morality<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
cannot be the foundation of morality and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
cannot be the foundation of morality and
obviously<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.289> succeeds<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
obviously I don't think it succeeds so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
obviously I don't think it succeeds so
here's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> Euthyphro<00:00:30.090> dilemma

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
here's the Euthyphro dilemma

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.020 
here's the Euthyphro dilemma
is<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.590> which<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.890> good<00:00:32.099> commanded<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:32.790> God

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is that which is good commanded by God

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.450 
is that which is good commanded by God
because<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.040> good<00:00:35.309> because

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
because it is good or is it good because

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.540 
because it is good or is it good because
God<00:00:35.880> commands<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:37.010> another<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.280> thinking

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
God commands it another way of thinking

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040 
God commands it another way of thinking
about<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.910> would<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> ask<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> question

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
about this would be to ask the question

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
about this would be to ask the question
is<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:41.010> standard<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> morality<00:00:41.550> something

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
is the standard of morality something

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.069 
is the standard of morality something
external<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.899> God<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.829> he<00:00:43.950> created

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
external to God or something he created

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.510 
external to God or something he created
now<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.469> option<00:00:46.649> shows<00:00:47.129> us<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> if

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
now the first option shows us that if

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
now the first option shows us that if
God<00:00:47.730> commanded<00:00:48.450> something<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.320> it's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
God commanded something because it's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
God commanded something because it's
good<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> appealing<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> higher

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
good then he is appealing to a higher

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260 
good then he is appealing to a higher
standard<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.550> would<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> standard<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
standard that would make the standard of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
standard that would make the standard of
morality<00:00:54.360> external<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> him<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.920> can't<00:00:56.160> be

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
morality external to him so he can't be

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
morality external to him so he can't be
the<00:00:56.460> standard<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.660> second<00:00:57.989> option<00:00:58.320> makes

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the standard the second option makes

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
the standard the second option makes
morality<00:00:58.920> subject<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> God's<00:00:59.789> arbitrary

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
morality subject to God's arbitrary

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
morality subject to God's arbitrary
commands<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.859> morality

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
commands that would make morality

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.460 
commands that would make morality
subjective<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.329> once<00:01:03.539> again<00:01:03.840> God<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.320> not

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
subjective so once again God would not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
subjective so once again God would not
be<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> standard<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.250> projected<00:01:05.700> morality

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
be the standard of projected morality

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390 
be the standard of projected morality
the<00:01:06.840> answer<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.380> dilemma<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:08.070> neither

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the answer to this dilemma is neither

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
the answer to this dilemma is neither
the<00:01:09.210> standard<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> morality<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.439> external

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the standard of morality is not external

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
the standard of morality is not external
to<00:01:11.070> God<00:01:11.250> nor<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.330> he

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to God nor is it something that he

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
to God nor is it something that he
arbitrarily<00:01:13.110> creates<00:01:13.770> rather<00:01:14.430> God's<00:01:14.790> nature

there are more than just two options
available<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.130> us<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> leads<00:01:45.210> us<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
available to us and that leads us to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.190 
available to us and that leads us to

epidemic<00:01:49.200> doesn't<00:01:49.470> seem<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> realize<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> if

epidemic doesn't seem to realize that if
all<00:01:50.909> three<00:01:51.509> horns<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> trilemma

all three horns of a trilemma

all three horns of a trilemma
are<00:01:52.979> equally<00:01:53.460> unacceptable<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> trilemma

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
are equally unacceptable then a trilemma

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

do think epidemics third option here is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.749 
do think epidemics third option here is
at<00:02:00.689> least<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.290> creative<00:02:01.950> attempt<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.549> try<00:02:02.729> to

well this poses certain problems for the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
claim that God is omnipotent but let's

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.360 
claim that God is omnipotent but let's
set<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.359> aside<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:20.769> choose<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.190> option

set that aside if we choose this option

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.729 
set that aside if we choose this option
then<00:03:21.970> something<00:03:22.600> other<00:03:22.840> than<00:03:23.170> God<00:03:23.380> is

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
then something other than God is

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.050 
then something other than God is
actually<00:03:24.340> dictating<00:03:24.970> what<00:03:25.269> God's<00:03:25.690> nature<00:03:26.049> is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
actually dictating what God's nature is

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.460 
actually dictating what God's nature is
ultimately<00:03:28.060> then<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.870> external

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
ultimately then it is this external

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170 
ultimately then it is this external
force<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:30.069> is<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.340> true<00:03:30.760> ground<00:03:31.000> of
