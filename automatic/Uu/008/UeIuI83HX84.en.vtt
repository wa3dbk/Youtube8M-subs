to<00:00:07.440> be<00:00:07.529> doing<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.859> focused<00:00:08.400> comparison<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
to be doing a focused comparison of the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.959 
to be doing a focused comparison of the
GoPro<00:00:11.269> hero3<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.929> polar<00:00:13.290> Pro<00:00:13.969> macro

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
GoPro hero3 with the polar Pro macro

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.620 
GoPro hero3 with the polar Pro macro
lens<00:00:15.210> installed<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.590> that's<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
lens installed so that's right here and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.870 
lens installed so that's right here and
we're<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.660> gonna<00:00:18.980> move<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.400> camera<00:00:20.699> closer

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we're just gonna move the camera closer

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
we're just gonna move the camera closer
and<00:00:21.119> closer<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.020> zero<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.529> we're

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and closer to the zero to that we're

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.519 
and closer to the zero to that we're
gonna<00:00:22.740> focus<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.990> until<00:00:25.380> what

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
gonna focus on and see it up until what

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
gonna focus on and see it up until what
point<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.949> stays<00:00:26.160> focused<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.000> we'll

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
point it stays focused and then we'll

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.160 
point it stays focused and then we'll
open<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.970> macro<00:00:29.970> lens<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
open up the macro lens so it's just the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170 
open up the macro lens so it's just the
normal<00:00:31.470> GoPro<00:00:31.890> lens<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> we'll<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> same

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
normal GoPro lens and we'll do the same

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
normal GoPro lens and we'll do the same
thing<00:00:33.360> again<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.829> settings<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.340> shooting

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
thing again as for settings I'm shooting

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.090 
thing again as for settings I'm shooting
1080p<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.450> 30<00:00:36.750> frames<00:00:36.809> per<00:00:37.140> second<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.620> narrow

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
1080p at 30 frames per second on narrow

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
1080p at 30 frames per second on narrow
just<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> mozu<00:00:39.930> min<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> close-up

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
just so I get the mozu min and close-up

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180 
just so I get the mozu min and close-up
detail<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.430> possible<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:43.800> focusing

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
detail as possible on what I'm focusing

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
detail as possible on what I'm focusing
on<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.190> we'll<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.700> move<00:00:50.899> closer

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
on so here we go we'll just move closer

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
on so here we go we'll just move closer
and<00:00:52.079> closer<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.520> watching<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.059> phone

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and closer and I'm watching on my phone

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
and closer and I'm watching on my phone
here<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> loaded<00:00:55.350> idea<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.770> what

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
here so I have a loaded idea of what

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
here so I have a loaded idea of what
it's<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.340> like

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 

it's<00:01:04.949> amazing<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.339> still<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.640> very<00:01:05.670> good

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's amazing we still have very good

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
it's amazing we still have very good
detail<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.719> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:08.039> after<00:01:08.219> I<00:01:08.429> think

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
detail right here and then after I think

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310 
detail right here and then after I think
in<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.210> inches<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.899> will<00:01:10.020> start

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
in about two inches away it will start

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.679 
in about two inches away it will start
to<00:01:10.969> it'll<00:01:11.969> start<00:01:12.179> to<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.359> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.509> bit<00:01:12.659> blurry

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
to it'll start to go a little bit blurry

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.940 
to it'll start to go a little bit blurry
it<00:01:15.689> seems<00:01:15.929> like<00:01:16.079> right<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.469> there<00:01:16.740> we've

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it seems like right about there we've

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
it seems like right about there we've
kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> lost<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 

now<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.409> ahead<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.770> open<00:01:37.950> up

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
now I'm going to go ahead and open up

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.760 
now I'm going to go ahead and open up
the<00:01:39.500> filter<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.010> get<00:01:41.130> an<00:01:41.220> idea

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
the filter just so you can get an idea

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.750 
the filter just so you can get an idea
without<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.010> what<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> video<00:01:44.580> would<00:01:44.729> look

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
without that what the video would look

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.130 
without that what the video would look
like<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.300> we'll<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.660> same<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:45.870> we'll

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
like and we'll do the same thing we'll

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.950 
like and we'll do the same thing we'll
go<00:01:46.310> right<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.550> in<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:50.220> very<00:01:50.820> very<00:01:51.510> striking

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
go right back in so a very very striking

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
go right back in so a very very striking
distance<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.920> difference<00:01:53.700> between<00:01:55.190> with<00:01:56.190> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
distance the difference between with and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
distance the difference between with and
without<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.460> macro<00:01:59.850> lens<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.140> can

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
without the the macro lens as you can

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.880 
without the the macro lens as you can
see<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:03.229> not<00:02:04.229> until<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.380> cameras

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
see it's really not until the cameras

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.490 
see it's really not until the cameras
probably<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.880> at<00:02:09.060> least<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.780> foot<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.470> half

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
probably like at least a foot and a half

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.640 
probably like at least a foot and a half
away<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:12.959> focusing<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.560> we

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
away from what we're focusing on that we

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
away from what we're focusing on that we
get<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.890> focus<00:02:14.130> back<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:16.200> even<00:02:16.440> like

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
get that focus back so that's even like

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.090 
get that focus back so that's even like
even<00:02:16.920> from<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:17.489> with<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.830> start

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
even from here with just the the start

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.000 
even from here with just the the start
GoPro<00:02:20.520> lens<00:02:20.730> we're<00:02:20.970> still<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:22.010> focusing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
mention to focus on that but with the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.880 
mention to focus on that but with the
macro<00:02:24.570> lens<00:02:25.100> it's<00:02:26.959> it's<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.260> sharper<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
macro lens it's it's a lot sharper and a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:46.960 
macro lens it's it's a lot sharper and a
lot<00:02:29.100> more<00:02:29.310> clear
