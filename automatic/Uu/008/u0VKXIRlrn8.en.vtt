00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.070 

I<00:01:05.220> sped<00:01:06.220> up<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.400> helicopter<00:01:07.180> flying<00:01:07.479> sequence

I sped up the helicopter flying sequence
so<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:14.290> want<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.500> go<00:01:14.590> too<00:01:14.650> fast<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.400> like

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
so I don't want to go too fast and like

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.639 
so I don't want to go too fast and like
speeding<00:01:16.509> this<00:01:16.750> up<00:01:16.930> I'll<00:01:17.110> speed<00:01:17.380> up<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
speeding this up I'll speed up the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.800 
speeding this up I'll speed up the
helicopter<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:19.060> depends<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.600> where

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
helicopter because it depends on where

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
doing it in like cops and crooks I'll

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.550 
doing it in like cops and crooks I'll
just<00:01:28.509> have<00:01:28.659> speeded<00:01:28.930> up<00:01:29.080> right<00:01:29.350> here

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.230 

note<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.430> not<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> speed<00:01:37.090> I'm

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
note that this is not the speed I'm

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.930

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:59.540 

one<00:01:42.360> hundred<00:01:42.690> sixty-six<00:01:43.410> percent<00:01:43.560> faster

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.450 

what<00:02:00.150> what<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.230> need<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.070> slow

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
what what you need to do is go as slow

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.820 
what what you need to do is go as slow
as<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:04.050> towards<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
as you can when you get towards the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.950 
as you can when you get towards the
statute<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.590> when<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> jump<00:02:08.070> out

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
statute because when you jump out

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.790 
statute because when you jump out
usually<00:02:09.960> when<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> jump<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.650> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
usually when you jump out of a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.550 
usually when you jump out of a
helicopter<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.430> GTA<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:13.350> some<00:02:13.530> reason

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
helicopter in GTA you for some reason

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
helicopter in GTA you for some reason
you'll<00:02:13.980> jump<00:02:14.340> forward<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.420> you'll<00:02:15.600> go

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you'll jump forward and then you'll go

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
you'll jump forward and then you'll go
faster<00:02:16.490> just<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:19.730> recommend

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
faster just like this I recommend

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.060 
faster just like this I recommend
wearing<00:02:21.000> getting<00:02:21.690> armor<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.770> doesn't

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
wearing getting armor but it doesn't

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.800 
wearing getting armor but it doesn't
really<00:02:23.190> make<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.580> difference<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:24.210> now<00:02:24.450> but

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
really make a difference right now but

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
really make a difference right now but
you<00:02:24.960> go<00:02:25.080> through<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> front<00:02:25.620> door<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.910> up

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
you go through the front door you go up

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.310 
you go through the front door you go up
the<00:02:27.330> ladder<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.750> you'll<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.050> through

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
the ladder and then you'll get through

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.520 
the ladder and then you'll get through
that<00:02:31.440> hole<00:02:31.710> there<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.140> you'll<00:02:34.320> see<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
that hole there and then you'll see a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.650 
that hole there and then you'll see a
big<00:02:34.740> red<00:02:34.980> thing<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> top<00:02:35.850> which<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.480> the
