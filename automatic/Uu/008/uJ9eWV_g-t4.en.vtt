kickflip mixed together there is many

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.189 
kickflip mixed together there is many
different<00:00:14.340> ways<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.700> hard<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.049> way

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
ways you can learn how to hardly now

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
ways you can learn how to hardly now
yeah<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.570> first<00:00:21.840> starting<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.439> irony

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
yeah when first starting out with irony

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
yeah when first starting out with irony
and<00:00:22.769> hard<00:00:22.920> folks<00:00:23.130> here's<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.550> did<00:00:23.810> mostly

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and hard folks here's what I did mostly

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
and hard folks here's what I did mostly
because<00:00:24.960> I'm<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.350> short<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:26.340> board<00:00:26.609> can

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
because I'm really short my board can

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.060 
because I'm really short my board can
easily<00:00:27.800> credit<00:00:28.800> card<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.590> what<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> did<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
easily credit card me so what I did to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
easily credit card me so what I did to
keep<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.369> board<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.239> vertical<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
keep my board from going to vertical of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
keep my board from going to vertical of
the<00:00:33.870> end<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.250> learning

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the end with when I was first learning

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
the end with when I was first learning
to<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.120> horizontal<00:00:36.719> i<00:00:36.899> would

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
to make it go more horizontal i would

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
to make it go more horizontal i would
take<00:00:38.070> my<00:00:38.250> back<00:00:38.460> foot<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.890> like

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
take my back foot and put it on like

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250 
take my back foot and put it on like
near<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> corner<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.360> tail<00:00:42.570> behind<00:00:42.809> me

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
near the corner of the tail behind me

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.520 
near the corner of the tail behind me
and<00:00:43.789> what<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.410> given

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and what that would do is then given

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.010 
and what that would do is then given
more<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> front<00:00:47.129> show<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.670> i<00:00:48.629> would<00:00:48.780> shove

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
more of a front show and i would shove

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.130 
more of a front show and i would shove
it<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> friendship<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.809> my<00:00:51.809> front

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it just like a friendship and my front

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.729 
it just like a friendship and my front
foot<00:00:52.730> would<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:54.079> set<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.440> much<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
foot would be set up pretty much on the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.599 
foot would be set up pretty much on the
mole<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> board<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.370> more

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
mole of the board I'm a little bit more

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
mole of the board I'm a little bit more
of<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.910> tilted<00:01:00.440> more<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.890> more

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of a tilted more a little bit more

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.329 
of a tilted more a little bit more
tilter<00:01:02.489> than<00:01:02.640> cake<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.090> no<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.750> sideways

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
tilter than cake with no more sideways

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.960 
tilter than cake with no more sideways
and<00:01:05.510> what<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.140> foot<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and what I would do with that foot is I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.740 
and what I would do with that foot is I
would<00:01:10.070> basically<00:01:11.070> flick<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.330> kind<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
would basically flick it like kind of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.580 
would basically flick it like kind of
like<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> around<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.470> now

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like down and around like that and now

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
like down and around like that and now
make<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.640> horizontal<00:01:21.540> hard

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
make it be like a really horizontal hard

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
make it be like a really horizontal hard
flip<00:01:21.960> I'll<00:01:22.500> try<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
flip I'll try to do one this is how I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
flip I'll try to do one this is how I
learned<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.200> i'm<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.409> too<00:01:25.470> sure<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.740> i

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
learned them so i'm not too sure if i

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
learned them so i'm not too sure if i
could<00:01:26.070> still<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.390> might

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
could still do it like that but i might

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.030 
could still do it like that but i might
be<00:01:28.229> able<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:30.409> see<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> makes<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.860> more

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
be able to see it makes it go more

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.149 
be able to see it makes it go more
horizontal<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.950> just

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
horizontal then over time you just

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.410 
horizontal then over time you just
adjust<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.579> feet<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.970> how<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.240> feel

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
adjust your feet to how they feel

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
adjust your feet to how they feel
comfortable<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.380> when<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.549> more

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
comfortable for a hard when you get more

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
comfortable for a hard when you get more
comfortable<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> find<00:01:40.560> out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
comfortable with it and you find out

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.940 
comfortable with it and you find out
what<00:01:40.799> works<00:01:40.979> best<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:42.540> me<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.770> to

the<00:01:50.100> way<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.060> pop<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.649> give

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the way I do it now I just pop down give

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.800 
the way I do it now I just pop down give
it<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> tad<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> scooping<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.509> flick
