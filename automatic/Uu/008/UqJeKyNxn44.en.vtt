00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
people do it because as you will see

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.299 
people do it because as you will see
this<00:00:40.850> round<00:00:41.149> we<00:00:41.719> just<00:00:41.989> at<00:00:42.590> this<00:00:42.920> point<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
this round we just at this point in the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.979 
this round we just at this point in the
game<00:00:43.340> I<00:00:43.460> think<00:00:43.609> we<00:00:43.910> killed<00:00:44.149> every<00:00:44.570> single<00:00:44.870> one

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
game I think we killed every single one

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.569 
game I think we killed every single one
of<00:00:45.019> them<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.469> none<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:45.890> our<00:00:46.070> teammates<00:00:46.100> are

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
of them and none of our teammates are

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.660 
of them and none of our teammates are
dead<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.289> obviously<00:00:48.289> that<00:00:48.710> didn't<00:00:49.160> work<00:00:49.190> so

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
dead so obviously that didn't work so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.610 
dead so obviously that didn't work so
really<00:00:50.359> why<00:00:50.629> do<00:00:50.690> people<00:00:51.050> do<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.320> or<00:00:51.469> they<00:00:51.590> just

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
really why do people do it or they just

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.380 
really why do people do it or they just
trying<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.039> be<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.370> point<00:00:52.670> whores<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.179> just

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
trying to be like point whores and just

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.330 
trying to be like point whores and just
get<00:00:53.989> extra<00:00:54.350> points<00:00:54.530> or<00:00:54.829> are<00:00:54.920> they<00:00:55.039> actually

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
get extra points or are they actually

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.500 
get extra points or are they actually
thinking<00:00:55.670> they're<00:00:55.850> going<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:56.059> win<00:00:56.179> with<00:00:56.210> it

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
thinking they're going to win with it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.779 
thinking they're going to win with it
because<00:00:57.199> if<00:00:57.620> you're<00:00:57.769> in<00:00:57.859> a<00:00:57.920> public<00:00:58.070> match<00:00:58.460> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
because if you're in a public match and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.369 
because if you're in a public match and
you<00:00:58.969> do<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.719> are<00:00:59.809> probably<00:01:00.109> going<00:01:00.289> to

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
you do that you are probably going to

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.650 
you do that you are probably going to
lose<00:01:00.589> because<00:01:00.890> everyone<00:01:01.579> spread<00:01:01.760> out<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.329> I

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
lose because everyone spread out and I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.780 
lose because everyone spread out and I
don't<00:01:03.410> know<00:01:03.559> just<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:04.190> don't<00:01:04.340> have<00:01:04.490> too<00:01:04.670> much

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
same exact route because it's been

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.430 
same exact route because it's been
working<00:05:13.670> I've<00:05:13.760> not<00:05:14.000> been<00:05:14.090> compromised<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
with the National throw enough so to

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.160 
with the National throw enough so to
