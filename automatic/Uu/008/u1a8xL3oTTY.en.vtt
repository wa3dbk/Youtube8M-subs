00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
be good so that's one cool thing you can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
be good so that's one cool thing you can
go<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.229> another<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.280> go

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
go there and do another thing you can go

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.130 
go there and do another thing you can go
there<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> life-size

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
there to do is they have a life-size

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
there to do is they have a life-size
replica<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.960> scrap<00:01:54.960> yard<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:55.470> mw2<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.340> think

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
replica of scrap yard from mw2 I think

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.429 
replica of scrap yard from mw2 I think
you<00:01:57.270> guys<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> map<00:01:57.810> scrapyard<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you guys know the map scrapyard you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490 
you guys know the map scrapyard you
should<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> map<00:01:59.100> scrapyard<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:01.200> like

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
should know the map scrapyard it's like

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.679 
should know the map scrapyard it's like
the<00:02:01.920> best<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> best<00:02:03.509> because

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the best or one of the best because

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
the best or one of the best because
that's<00:02:03.869> how<00:02:04.049> our<00:02:04.110> eyes<00:02:04.259> I'd<00:02:04.469> say<00:02:04.710> map<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:06.090> mon

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
that's how our eyes I'd say map on mon

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.399 
that's how our eyes I'd say map on mon
or<00:02:06.390> 42<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> probably<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> greatest

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
or 42 and probably one of the greatest

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.770 
or 42 and probably one of the greatest
maps<00:02:07.799> all<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:08.160> i<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:09.030> an<00:02:09.179> awesome<00:02:09.599> map

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
maps all time i think is an awesome map

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.740 
maps all time i think is an awesome map
anyway<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.489> life-size<00:02:12.150> replica<00:02:12.599> so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
anyway they have a life-size replica so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.700 
anyway they have a life-size replica so
the<00:02:12.870> exact<00:02:13.260> same

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the exact same

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
the exact same
thing<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.430> map<00:02:14.640> virtually<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.510> real<00:02:15.810> life

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
thing as the map virtually in real life

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.400 
thing as the map virtually in real life
for<00:02:16.740> paintballing<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.660> own<00:02:18.810> my<00:02:18.990> own<00:02:19.020> gun<00:02:19.380> i

have an invert mini if you guys any guys
paintball<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.990> might<00:02:22.170> know<00:02:22.290> what<00:02:22.410> an<00:02:22.500> invert

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
paintball you might know what an invert

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.620 
paintball you might know what an invert
mini<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.340> uh<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.880> 300<00:02:24.120> our<00:02:24.450> gun

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
mini is it's uh it's like 300 our gun

pretty<00:02:25.110> expensive<00:02:25.380> when<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:26.340> said<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
pretty expensive when it's all said and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.940 
pretty expensive when it's all said and
done<00:02:26.670> all<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.300> equipment<00:02:27.720> cost<00:02:27.960> near<00:02:28.470> thousand

dollars so i can say that i spent a good

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.570 
dollars so i can say that i spent a good
amount<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.620> money<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.100> paintball

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
amount of money on my paintball

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
life-size replica of scrap yard because

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.520 
life-size replica of scrap yard because
I<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> map<00:02:42.060> very<00:02:42.270> well<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.380> would

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
I know the map very well and it would

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.960 
I know the map very well and it would
just<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.770> awesome<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.220> play<00:02:44.280> paintball<00:02:44.610> there
