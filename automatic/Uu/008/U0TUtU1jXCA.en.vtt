00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.520
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.240
 occasion is that a video about how 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.929
 install the 11 53 edition for our 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.240
 samsung galaxy 7 58 30 m and also the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.550
 version is this process we are going to do 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.950
 in our device and good what 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.550
 we must do is download the two 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.110
 records 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 I'll leave that to the description of 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.560
 this video which are the chloroform 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.270
 and the round 5 s 30 once there 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.520
 downloaded they copy it into the root of the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.320
 sd card and we can continue with the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.179
 process so for that we're going to go 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.039
 in the recovery mode and to do so we go 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:40.309
 to do it by pressing the volume keys 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:43.190
 plus the home key and the power key that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.949
 is the power key 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.140
 the three girls who at the same time 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.940
 we press without releasing them until 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.160
 enter the record as well said 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.040
 wait until the logo appears 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.020
 samsung so that between collect 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.030
 inside the samsung logo only 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.940
 we should expect him to do his thing now 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.320
 has already entered now but already the mode 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.790
 recovery we move that the interface of 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.620
 volume more and volume less and 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.180
 we selected with comma for it we 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.150
 let's go to the second option the police 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.920
 bill gates for this car we give them in the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.170
 club a mod 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.479
 and we hope our recovery will change 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.540
 design do not worry it's only 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.909
 momentary the third option 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:30.140
 of reset we give in yeste 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:34.430
 and will start to reset what would be the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.960
 internal memory now we're going to the to the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.090
 fourth option which says way cache 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.280
 partition we give in 10 web cache 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.909
 we are not going to the last option which says 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 advanced 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.070
 this third option of all does not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.070
 we give in web 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.590
 We will simply give in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.270
 setback and now let's go to the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.459
 fifth option which says interest 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.129
 headquarters report we give to the first 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.750
 Chos option to mortgage and here already 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.739
 we are browsing our desktop 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.130
 let's find the rom of 5 s 3 edition 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.880
 collects 757 30 m points 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 st 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:35.160
 the selection now we both give in and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.930
 is to be installed 53 0 1 758 30.5 the rumba 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.220
 will begin to install not only will we 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.220
 let him do the process 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.760
 then already of the installed rumba 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.670
 correctly 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.680
 for that we corroborate where it says of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.410
 this way explain what he wants 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.610
 say and do not be certain that we have 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.610
 installed the meeting 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.340
 good that has worked in the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.050
 installation I got the word now 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.820
 well the only thing we have to do for 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.730
 last is to give the first robot option 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.400
 and we have selected them and now 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 it's going to start charging good now it's going 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.170
 to pay but re-ignite with the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.020
 new design of the room c5 s3 edition 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.349
 this really by its name says he 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.680
 it was stolen cerberus 0 105 and is based 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:08.069
 with aspects of galaxy s3 that is 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.069
 means cerberus 5 edition s 3 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.120
 we wait for him to load 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.000
 well here the samsung logo does not 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.920
 it may take more than two minutes and one 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.570
 action I give are three minutes to 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.790
 give him the opportunity that they can 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 pluck but no rice and no rum 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.169
 let mother delay 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 3 to 4 minutes and it's past 5 and I 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.400
 I think sure that the restaurants 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.770
 but even he managed to take some 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 minute and that he did not even sue them 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.380
 the time so I'm going to make the voice of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.980
 animation that abc del project 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.980
 s 3 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.960
 I use the screen and black but not 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.970
 about occupy this completely normal 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.460
 what we should expect is now is 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.620
 simply turn on the LEDs 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.360
 action keys and that you will not want anymore 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.160
 say that the device is about 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.590
 of starting the keys already lit 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.970
 book the phone and they lit and 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.790
 then that means that it is already 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.390
 now they started what has been said is true 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.400
 home tells us welcome 7 58 30 do not know 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.560
 worry about who we are and today we continue 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.940
 being the same version so now you 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.200
 we give in a touch the hunger for 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.600
 start 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.430
 we give in omit good here it happened to me 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.910
 lock the device always only 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.780
 about group is normal we block him 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.300
 we give in omit we give the following and 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.590
 the rumba is not already with tlc aspects of 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.630
 she who starts to sound with those 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.270
 sounds that it has 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.890
 we have the following and now the rumba 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.080
 starts the initial round so I hope 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.750
 that you liked this tree to me 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.460
 I'm very fascinated by the fact 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.900
 which has a lot of compatibility with 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.820
 applications that the other broke 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.010
 they work so I liked it a lot 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.630
 that's why I hope you served them this 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.390
 has been today's video subscribe to me 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.430

 that they comment to me since in youtube in 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.700
 Sometimes I can answer
