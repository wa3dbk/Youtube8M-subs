00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.020
 in a variety of games to manage 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.760
 rather than a gamepad than a mouse and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 the keyboard is not just separate 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.559
 ported projects from consoles but games 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.690
 a particular genre like fighting game where without 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.910
 Now these devices do not do cards 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 gamepads on the market very much and choose 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 suitable model is difficult today we 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 look at the inexpensive model nx strike 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
 companies spelling is a wired gamepad 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.340
 for pc with usb 2 0 interfaces and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 supporting vibration it is made of black 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.780
 frosted plastic with a small glossy 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 insert in front even after many hours 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 session it looks great prints not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 spoil the look 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 hinge inscription sticks two buttons 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 painted red copy 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 popular models from sony and microsoft 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.539
 speed-link did not try to do 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.309
 something of their own 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.050
 although completely avoid the similarity 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.270
 certainly could not remind something 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
 x-box controller something dual shock 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 the result is ergonomic 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 comfortable gamepad with a comfortable two grip 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 fingers 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.000
 if you take three to manage also 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 tax triggers that already 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 not so comfortable action buttons 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 signed x-box style controller 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 ex wedding and they are pretty high not 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.610
 have rounded shapes therefore 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.799
 in passing 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.450
 it is not very convenient to press them 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.760
 only three buttons are arranged in a row 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.560
 on the center of the gamepad knob someone answers 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.490
 for switching between modes and xinput 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 and direct input 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.689
 and the indicators below it show how about 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 the mode is now selected so the value 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.990
 buttons can be reassigned using 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.400
 special tools and problems 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 compatibility with games in this 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.460
 gamepads will not occur 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 depot is made platform- based 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 which is hidden under the casing that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 undoubtedly a plus for fans of fighting games 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
 because such a design is almost 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.509
 completely eliminates the likelihood 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.310
 accidental or inaccurate bumper pressing 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.729
 and oblong shape more calculated 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
 on lateral pressing rather than direct 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.640
 medium trigger analogue triggers 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.710
 made shaped levers therefore 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 pressed comfortable but their mechanism is not 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 looks reliable pushing the button up 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 the end you feel like it is light 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.020
 warp even with the best light creak 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.820
 the analog stick mechanism is the same 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 move well and press in all 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.439
 directions even rubberized caps 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 look safe and should not throw 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.630
 after a couple of months of active 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.670
 of use 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.470
 the only thing that bothers it is loud 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.300
 the build quality of the gamepad is not particularly 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.400
 find fault with seams neat details 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
 fit each other nothing backlash 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.680
 loose claims can arise 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 body stiffness it creaks slightly 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
 squeeze well and forget what we face 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 budget model that can be forgiven 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.570
 such trifle one x trike if 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.700
 wireless version that looks like 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.650
 in the same way just a little harder for 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.600
 battery bill as for this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 gamepad then me and my colleagues 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.650
 he liked inexpensive nice 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.510
 works well and the function 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.940
 vibration important thing not to lean too much 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.010
 on the trigger and the perfect choice for 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.870
 fighting game polygon lover and what 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.870
 quite importantly inexpensive
