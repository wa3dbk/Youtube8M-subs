00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.029
 but it was on a list said of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.029
 national 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.630
 make you sad 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:24.000
 Graciela's photo is not a topic that 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.439
 He said that young and not only by one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.910
 but because I'm not explaining so 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 all the time of my treatment and the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 knee brings me back some time very 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.219
 difficult that I passed with my leg to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 effort that I did to be well and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.790
 that obviously could not until 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
 I found this product that I read in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 key and these doctors who helped 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.070
 have been left in my body 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.900
 to be able to return to the same weight as 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.420
 We were 25 years old 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.860
 and on the rise I no longer had tools 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.260
 to defend myself it looked good this is what 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.600
 I'm I come dance with my wife not 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.360
 have a good time tell me talk about how active 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.850
 spinning we went through that side and I 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.160
 it started to hurt and that's why later with the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.800
 it's been a while since I left 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.660
 watching the videos and what we did 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.070
 many times and because it is at this moment 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.110
 he does not answer chicken he knew that I 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.940
 internally I was sad because in addition 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.260
 not only for an aesthetic question 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.360
 but a health issue or a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.210
 question that your company generate you 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 you go and you go thinking if you would be 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.369
 so I found and I want to thank the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.750
 doctor adores the pronokal doctor 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.820
 also not everyone asks me what is the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.890
 room on twitter 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.270
 good things is a Spanish product 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 which is called pronokal that they do not 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 advertising them in general 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.010
 obviously it was with treatment that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 I started with cormillot that also 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.400
 thank you very much obviously 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.340
 I had to find something that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.560
 it turns out that it was effective do not pass 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.940
 I'm hungry, I'm very good 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.550
 vitamins corrections said one of the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.320
 guys here are taking steroids 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.790
 that I the truth that she is active 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.080
 that is all natural written hands about 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.869
 products that are transformed are 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.490
 envelopes that are transformed into an omelet 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.920
 in smoothie in milkshake and at the beginning the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.230
 45 days and the first 15 is difficult 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.160
 because you happen to eat like an astronaut 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.450
 but then when you start to see the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 results or at least in my body 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.200
 despite seeing the result of if you listen 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 I want to continue has half tube disney 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.510
 that the pilot and we go great I did not eat a 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.510
 hamburger 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.250
 the tour also we had 15 days in 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.720
 the south I think a chocolate and you 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.620
 I wrote to the nutritionist's doctor 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.360
 girls with good but routes topics is 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.410
 a treatment that you are being followed or 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.200
 be because I recommend it because I 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.150
 It worked, it did me good, I did not have a bad time 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 whether it is obviously to lower one has 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.120
 to be in passing a little 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.830
 hungry but not the streets after 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.050
 just what this has that does not 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.700
 it has a rebound effect because its seen 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.260
 insulin I transformed as I say in 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.760
 a sect is practically not that 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.170
 talking about this truth I did shape 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.370
 part of a sect by how he talks everything 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.720
 of the place that today they ask me 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.520
 When I count, I want all the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.620
 world works like me 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.390
 not because your metabolism goes up and 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.350
 you start really how to activate the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.690
 calls 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.160
 It's the moment 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.670
 they want to ask is if you're going to go back to 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 see alcohol 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.030
 now I regretted some of me 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.800
 I remember that this incursion of 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.890
 you have to dance was really 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 terrible and superstition bag from 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.790
 all wind is not only what 's 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.990
 nacha but in general everything I regret 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.520
 of this new foray to say good 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.990
 over when you left better than you 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.010
 They spent flirting and it's been like no 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.360
 he was going to regret some place not me 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 I never regret anything that 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.410
 I do have to take other precautions 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.080
 that always being such is a bit 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.330
 naive always trust always go with 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.860
 this that we are not to say to 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.180
 innocence then already against you if you are in 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.010
 he, yes, I am innocent but always 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.470
 I tend to go with open arms to 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.140
 a relationship a job to a friendship 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.220
 always maybe ingested that go a little 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.810
 more prepared 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.220
 we were prepared it happens to him that as I said 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.680
 the other day that in your programs little 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.450
 I never knew that they would incorporate 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.400
 graciela silvina were a lot of 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 fronts that left after they left 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.980
 giving was the possibility that if I 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.810
 I knew that they had not told me either 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.130
 Cristian Castro studies that a lot of 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.669
 things that after we left like 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.669
 finding out 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.850
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.820
 if cristian treatment told me that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.820
 I loved when nothing had happened 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.100
 not what happens is that it is done from the 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.740
 2010 is that I wanted to leave I wanted to see me 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.330
 to cÃ³rdoba was crazy to Carlos peace 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.410
 orthomolecular joy one hour that 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.410
 I was a little day too
