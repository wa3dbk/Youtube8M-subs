 people passed away it is a 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.320
 training that covered the route between 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.550
 madrid and ferrol the incident occurred 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.550
 in santiago de compostela galicia 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 and the images show four 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.210
 values â€‹â€‹I have fully realized and

 one of them on fire 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.390
 there you can see perfectly 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.989
 when a fire started in one of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 the wagons 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.730
 I reiterate the emergency services and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.310
 firefighters are already working there in the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.190
 place to try 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.250
 respect those who were on board

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.810
 It covered the route between Madrid and Ferrol 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.139
 [Music] 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 the different means of communication of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.430
 Spain promptly mentions a dozen 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.100
 of dead though the company 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.040
 railway has not yet confirmed the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 number of fatalities or so 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.570
 the number of injured but look 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.930
 railway accident in Spain more 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.200
 precisely in santiago de compostela 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 the train derailed in a steep 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 curve 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 is seriously affected affected 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.100

 At least 240 people were traveling 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.520
 and it is working minute by minute 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.650
 to save the lives of those people 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 that have also been trapped in the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.810
 inside of some these wagons 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 provide assistance to the injured 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.840
 and also unfortunately determine the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.540
 number of fatalities as a result of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.730

 derailed from this training 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.230
 four wagons seriously compromised 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.270
 completely turned to one of 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.220
 they are on fire 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.830
 it occurred in a very sharp curve 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 which can be seen in fact in this image 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.260
 punctually there derails 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:15.100
 and later this image 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.060
 covered the route from madrid to ferrol 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.700
 there is watching you in the curve 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.630
 in which derails how they have been 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.630
 those wagons 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.880
 subsequently a fire at least 240 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.920
 people were traveling on board 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.880

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.160
 right then we are going to expand the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 reitero information is worked 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.520
 intensely
