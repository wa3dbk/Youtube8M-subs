thing so Mac Melba is one that I like

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.550 
thing so Mac Melba is one that I like
but<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.550> me<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.150> more<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:26.960> it's<00:02:27.320> very

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
but for me it's more of one it's very

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.710 
but for me it's more of one it's very
neutral<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.120> goes<00:02:29.270> with<00:02:29.450> any

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
neutral and it's one that goes with any

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.260 
neutral and it's one that goes with any
type<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.320> makeup<00:02:30.680> you're<00:02:31.070> wearing<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:31.520> all

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
type of makeup you're wearing at all

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.210 
type of makeup you're wearing at all
it's<00:02:32.630> definitely<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:33.080> my<00:02:33.140> most<00:02:33.440> experimental

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
it's definitely not my most experimental

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.340 
it's definitely not my most experimental
blusher<00:02:34.910> choice<00:02:35.300> because<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.810> quite<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
blusher choice because it is quite a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.170 
blusher choice because it is quite a
dull<00:02:36.890> color<00:02:37.250> compared<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.850> other<00:02:38.000> ones

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
dull color compared to the other ones

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.540 
dull color compared to the other ones
but<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.630> good<00:02:38.900> if<00:02:39.110> you're<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.860> really<00:02:40.070> into

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
but it is good if you're not really into

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.340 
but it is good if you're not really into
the<00:02:40.670> whole<00:02:40.700> bronzing<00:02:41.390> highlighting<00:02:42.230> this
