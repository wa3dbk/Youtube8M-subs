that's<00:00:00.120> what<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.420> lure<00:00:00.630> is<00:00:00.659> doing<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.350> the

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
that's what the lure is doing in the

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:14.560 
that's what the lure is doing in the
water<00:00:08.090> so<00:00:09.090> if<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.809> lure<00:00:11.120> if<00:00:12.230> your<00:00:13.230> lure<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
water so if your lure if your lure is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.990 
water so if your lure if your lure is
rotating<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:16.379> working<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.789> looks

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
rotating it's not working if it looks

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800 
rotating it's not working if it looks
like<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:19.140> good<00:00:20.270> you're<00:00:21.270> getting<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
like that you're good you're getting the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929 
like that you're good you're getting the
wobbling<00:00:22.230> action<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.980> fast<00:00:23.310> wobble

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
wobbling action it's a fast wobble

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.800 
wobbling action it's a fast wobble
action<00:00:24.480> okay<00:00:25.789> can<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:29.269> slower<00:00:30.269> action

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
action okay can you get a slower action

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.430 
action okay can you get a slower action
than<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.199> yes<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:34.010> maximum<00:00:35.329> max<00:00:36.440> that's

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
than that yes but maximum max that's

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
than that yes but maximum max that's
what<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.309> no<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.090> no<00:00:39.530> more<00:00:41.120> how

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what you look like no more no more how

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.080 
what you look like no more no more how
can<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.390> achieve<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.040> slower<00:00:44.040> wobble<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.969> if

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
can we achieve a slower wobble but if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
can we achieve a slower wobble but if
you're<00:00:45.210> plunking<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.899> need<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you're plunking you need to be in a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
you're plunking you need to be in a
little<00:00:46.559> sore<00:00:46.770> water<00:00:47.070> okay<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.390> may

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
little sore water okay and it may

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.090 
little sore water okay and it may
literally<00:00:50.149> just<00:00:51.149> sit<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:53.090> like<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
literally just sit on there like this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
literally just sit on there like this
right<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> it'll<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.910> wobble<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
right and it'll just wobble like that a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260 
right and it'll just wobble like that a
little<00:00:57.870> slower<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> little<00:00:59.789> faster

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
little slower if you're a little faster

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.459 
little slower if you're a little faster
water<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> look

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
water that's what it's going to look

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.969 
water that's what it's going to look
like<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.920> long<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:03.350> rotating<00:01:04.350> all

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like as long as it's not rotating all

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.390 
like as long as it's not rotating all
the<00:01:05.339> way<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.900> then<00:01:06.900> you're<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.380> okay<00:01:08.070> as

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the way over then you're good okay as

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.539 
the way over then you're good okay as
long<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.000> rotating<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:11.100> drift

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
long as it's not rotating if your drift

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
long as it's not rotating if your drift
fishing<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> start<00:01:13.140> off<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.619> froggy

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
fishing and you start off in some froggy

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.090 
fishing and you start off in some froggy
water<00:01:14.610> yeah<00:01:15.439> it's<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> slower

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
water yeah it's going to be a slower

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
water yeah it's going to be a slower
wobble<00:01:17.659> that's<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
wobble that's why we have to have that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.649 
wobble that's why we have to have that
input<00:01:19.909> input<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.420> okay<00:01:23.150> now<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
input input to it okay now a lot of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.880 
input input to it okay now a lot of
people<00:01:24.780> ask<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.799> size<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.430> use<00:01:27.890> predominantly

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
people ask what size I use predominantly

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330 
people ask what size I use predominantly
i<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.790> number<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.159> wii's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
i use number one I don't use the wii's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
i use number one I don't use the wii's
I'm<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.000> saying<00:01:33.270> they're<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.630> good<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.170> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I'm not saying they're not good they are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
I'm not saying they're not good they are
good<00:01:34.619> great<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.310> trout<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> people

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
good great for trout a lot of people

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.609 
good great for trout a lot of people
will<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.700> buy

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
will go out there and they will buy

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
will go out there and they will buy
number<00:01:40.619> two's<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> bigger<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
number two's that's the bigger one and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
number two's that's the bigger one and
that's<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.740> comes<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that's the one that comes with the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.990 
that's the one that comes with the
swivel<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:47.100> has<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.579> swivel

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
swivel on it right that has the swivel

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.859 
swivel on it right that has the swivel
but<00:01:48.750> guess<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:50.130> bigger<00:01:50.399> ones<00:01:50.840> those<00:01:51.840> are

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
but guess what the bigger ones those are

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.760 
but guess what the bigger ones those are
better<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.649> trout<00:01:52.950> kokanee<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.670> cutthroat

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
better for trout kokanee and cutthroat

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
better for trout kokanee and cutthroat
believe<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.790> bigger<00:01:57.149> ones<00:01:57.450> are

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
believe it or not the bigger ones are

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.289 
believe it or not the bigger ones are
better<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.110> kokanee<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> trout<00:01:59.299> cutthroat

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
better for kokanee and trout cutthroat

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
better for kokanee and trout cutthroat
trout<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> self<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.200> Washington<00:02:01.799> things

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
trout and self like Washington things

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.800 
trout and self like Washington things
like<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> walleye<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.229> number<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
like that walleye the number one is the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.100 
like that walleye the number one is the
perfect<00:02:06.810> size<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.500> salmon<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.340> steelhead

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
perfect size for salmon and steelhead

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.240 
perfect size for salmon and steelhead
perfect<00:02:10.110> size

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
perfect size

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.370 
perfect size
so<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.060> bigger<00:02:14.330> ones<00:02:14.630> they've<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> little

not<00:06:55.710> but<00:06:56.009> what<00:06:56.189> I<00:06:56.219> really<00:06:56.580> like<00:06:56.729> about<00:06:56.759> it<00:06:57.150> are

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
not but what I really like about it are

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.869 
not but what I really like about it are
the<00:06:57.629> color<00:06:57.930> combinations<00:06:58.650> he<00:06:59.280> has<00:06:59.430> colors

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 
the color combinations he has colors

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:03.200 
the color combinations he has colors
that<00:07:00.449> no<00:07:01.050> one<00:07:01.259> else<00:07:01.409> has<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:02.099> when<00:07:02.999> it<00:07:03.090> comes

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
that no one else has and when it comes

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.290 
that no one else has and when it comes
to<00:07:03.389> kokanee<00:07:03.779> I<00:07:03.810> think<00:07:04.050> color<00:07:04.469> does<00:07:04.919> matter<00:07:05.300> it

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
to kokanee I think color does matter it

techniques<00:07:42.270> and<00:07:42.599> become<00:07:42.840> very<00:07:43.080> good<00:07:43.379> at<00:07:43.439> them

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740
