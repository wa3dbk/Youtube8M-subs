I try and pick out the smaller of the
strawberries<00:03:17.780> then<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.870> briefly<00:03:19.140> microwaved<00:03:19.890> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
strawberries then I briefly microwaved a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.370 
strawberries then I briefly microwaved a
tablespoon<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.910> either<00:03:21.150> apricot<00:03:21.990> or<00:03:22.140> peach

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
tablespoon of either apricot or peach

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.550 
tablespoon of either apricot or peach
jam<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.580> teaspoon<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:24.150> water<00:03:24.360> but<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.440> is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
jam and a teaspoon of water but it is

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.050 
jam and a teaspoon of water but it is
easy<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.070> brush<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.460> our<00:03:26.610> strawberries

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060

gives<00:03:34.970> them<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.180> nice<00:03:35.390> shine

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490
