tutorial on how to build it he saw it in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.750 
tutorial on how to build it he saw it in
one<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:22.020> older<00:00:22.470> videos<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.340> silent

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
one of my older videos one of my silent

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.560 
one of my older videos one of my silent
ones<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.380> decided<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.730> ahead<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> create

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
ones so I decided to go ahead and create

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
ones so I decided to go ahead and create
this<00:00:27.810> tutorial<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> show<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.460> how

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this tutorial for you and show you how

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
this tutorial for you and show you how
to<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.090> should<00:00:30.869> only<00:00:31.170> take<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.500> couple

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
to make it should only take a couple

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.340 
to make it should only take a couple
minutes<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> automated<00:00:37.020> melon

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
minutes so this is the automated melon

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400 
minutes so this is the automated melon
farm<00:00:37.670> semi-automated<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.780> still<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> go

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
farm semi-automated you still have to go

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.700 
farm semi-automated you still have to go
collect<00:00:40.800> everything<00:00:41.100> yourself<00:00:42.379> but<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.559> can

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
collect everything yourself but you can

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
collect everything yourself but you can
see<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> pressure<00:00:44.250> plate<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.000> that's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
see this pressure plate here and that's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.160 
see this pressure plate here and that's
what<00:00:45.930> activates<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.800> farm<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.170> walk

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
what activates the farm so as you walk

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
what activates the farm so as you walk
into<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> farm<00:00:51.739> all<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> mounts<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.640> Auto

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
into the farm all of the mounts are Auto

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.729 
into the farm all of the mounts are Auto
harvested<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> simply

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
harvested for you and then you simply

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:11.570 
harvested for you and then you simply
walk<00:00:58.739> around<00:01:01.760> pick<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.120> melons<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:11.040> then

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
walk around pick up your melons and then

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
walk around pick up your melons and then
getting<00:01:12.570> back<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> trick<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> case

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
getting back out as a trick in this case

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
getting back out as a trick in this case
because<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.400> didn't<00:01:14.729> give<00:01:14.880> myself<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.420> way<00:01:15.570> out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because I didn't give myself a way out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.670 
because I didn't give myself a way out
without<00:01:15.930> hitting<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> pressure<00:01:16.530> plate

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
without hitting the pressure plate

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
without hitting the pressure plate
anyway<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> create<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.759> obviously<00:01:21.420> we're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
anyway so to create this obviously we're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.330 
anyway so to create this obviously we're
utilizing<00:01:22.200> Pistons<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> nine<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.960> nine

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
utilizing Pistons this is a nine by nine

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.149 
utilizing Pistons this is a nine by nine
design<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.630> you're<00:01:28.170> familiar<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.710> my

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
design so if you're familiar with my

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
design so if you're familiar with my
wheat<00:01:29.369> farm<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.570> already<00:01:30.810> know

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
wheat farm over there you already know

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.100 
wheat farm over there you already know
that<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.680> single<00:01:32.460> water<00:01:33.119> source<00:01:33.509> block<00:01:33.810> will

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that a single water source block will

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.740 
that a single water source block will
water<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.710> nine<00:01:35.189> by<00:01:35.430> nine<00:01:36.530> area<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> land<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
water a nine by nine area of land so

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
water a nine by nine area of land so
it's<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> exact<00:01:40.350> same<00:01:40.380> size<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.670> wheat

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it's the exact same size as the wheat

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
it's the exact same size as the wheat
farm<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.689> means<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.380> could<00:01:43.590> easily

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
farm which means that this could easily

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
farm which means that this could easily
be<00:01:43.979> stacked<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> week<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.930> more

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
be stacked on top of the week for more

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.830 
be stacked on top of the week for more
under<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> wheat<00:01:46.740> farm<00:01:47.540> obviously<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.689> would

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
under the wheat farm obviously you would

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
under the wheat farm obviously you would
need<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> provide<00:01:49.380> some<00:01:49.649> sort<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> light<00:01:50.189> for

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
need to provide some sort of light for

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
need to provide some sort of light for
things<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.909> grow<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.560> than<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:54.320> it's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
things to grow but other than that it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.100 
things to grow but other than that it's
easily<00:01:55.619> stackable<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.299> let's<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> look<00:01:57.990> at

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
easily stackable so let's take a look at

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.710 
easily stackable so let's take a look at
how<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.380> thing<00:01:58.649> works

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.230 

to<00:02:02.720> start<00:02:02.960> with<00:02:03.170> we've<00:02:03.650> got<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.400> pressure<00:02:05.000> plate

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
to start with we've got a pressure plate

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.360 
to start with we've got a pressure plate
and<00:02:05.540> directly<00:02:05.960> beneath<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.500> pressure<00:02:06.770> plate<00:02:07.040> we

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
and directly beneath a pressure plate we

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.340 
and directly beneath a pressure plate we
have<00:02:07.610> some<00:02:08.450> redstone<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:10.640> wire<00:02:10.990> runs<00:02:11.990> to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
have some redstone and that wire runs to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.860 
have some redstone and that wire runs to
a<00:02:12.380> single<00:02:12.680> repeater<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.120> need<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.810> be

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
a single repeater you need this to be

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.890 
a single repeater you need this to be
able<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.410> make<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.890> full<00:02:16.550> length<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
able to make the full length the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.750 
able to make the full length the
repeater<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.560> either<00:02:18.740> go<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.340> location

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
repeater can either go in this location

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.870 
repeater can either go in this location
or<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.570> can<00:02:20.720> go<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.730> those

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
or it can go here but one of those

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.750 
or it can go here but one of those
locations<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.720> required<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:25.430> single

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
locations is required this single

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.950 
locations is required this single

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.470 
doesn't make it all the way to the very
end<00:02:27.320> if<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:28.130> didn't<00:02:28.550> put<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> repeater<00:02:29.180> there

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
end if you didn't put the repeater there

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.640 
end if you didn't put the repeater there
these<00:02:29.870> last<00:02:30.170> two<00:02:30.470> would<00:02:30.770> never<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.190> powered

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
these last two would never get powered

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.510 
these last two would never get powered
so<00:02:33.650> when<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.830> step<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.160> pressure<00:02:34.370> plate

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
so when you step on the pressure plate

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.910 
so when you step on the pressure plate
these<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.480> redstone<00:02:35.870> wire<00:02:36.200> gets<00:02:36.470> powered

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
these this redstone wire gets powered

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.100 
these this redstone wire gets powered
which<00:02:37.160> powers<00:02:37.610> all<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.940> repeaters<00:02:38.480> which

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
which powers all the repeaters which

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.310 
which powers all the repeaters which
sends<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> signal<00:02:39.860> into<00:02:40.520> these<00:02:41.450> blocks<00:02:41.900> which

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
sends a signal into these blocks which

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.050 
sends a signal into these blocks which
power<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.550> Pistons<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.520> other<00:02:46.670> side<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
power the Pistons the other side of the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.550 
power the Pistons the other side of the
Pistons<00:02:47.570> we've<00:02:48.470> got<00:02:50.230> another<00:02:51.230> row<00:02:51.530> of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
Pistons we've got another row of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.740 
Pistons we've got another row of
repeaters<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:53.120> pattern<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.660> repeated

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.470 

all<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.990> way<00:02:59.140> along<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:01.180> last<00:03:02.180> set<00:03:02.450> of

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
all the way along the last set of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.970 
all the way along the last set of
Pistons<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:03.200> don't<00:03:03.350> need<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.590> go<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.890> other

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
Pistons we don't need to go on the other

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.860 
Pistons we don't need to go on the other
side<00:03:04.280> obviously<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:08.510> all<00:03:08.720> there<00:03:08.810> is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
side obviously and that's all there is

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.470 
side obviously and that's all there is
to<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.430> build<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.090> need<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:13.480> two-block

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to it so to build it we need a two-block

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.900 
to it so to build it we need a two-block
deep<00:03:14.870> hole<00:03:15.230> that's<00:03:15.950> nine<00:03:16.370> by<00:03:16.640> nine<00:03:16.850> or

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
deep hole that's nine by nine or

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.970 
deep hole that's nine by nine or
actually<00:03:18.160> 10<00:03:19.570> by<00:03:20.570> 10<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.620> needs<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:21.890> be

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
actually 10 by 10 but it needs to be

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.190 
actually 10 by 10 but it needs to be
offset<00:03:22.459> slightly<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.450> reason<00:03:23.690> why<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.870> can't

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
offset slightly the reason why you can't

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.390 
offset slightly the reason why you can't
place<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.769> redstone<00:03:25.220> wire<00:03:25.550> right<00:03:25.850> next<00:03:26.239> to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
place this redstone wire right next to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.220 
place this redstone wire right next to
these<00:03:28.400> repeaters<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.570> when<00:03:29.750> this<00:03:29.870> block

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
these repeaters is that when this block

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.009 
these repeaters is that when this block
gets<00:03:30.560> powered<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.489> will<00:03:32.030> power<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.420> redstone

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
gets powered it will power the redstone

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.420 
gets powered it will power the redstone
wire<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.890> even<00:03:34.370> without<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.670> pressure<00:03:35.570> plate

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
wire so even without a pressure plate

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.800 
wire so even without a pressure plate
once<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.610> powered<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.180> will<00:03:38.300> stay<00:03:38.540> powered

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
once it's powered it will stay powered

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:48.190 
once it's powered it will stay powered
so<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.830> won't<00:03:40.190> work<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.690> as<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.870> can

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
so it won't work for you so as you can

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.890 
so it won't work for you so as you can
see<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:49.130> we<00:03:49.430> step<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:50.600> our<00:03:50.780> pressure<00:03:51.739> plate<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
see if we step on our pressure plate the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.930 
see if we step on our pressure plate the
signal<00:03:54.320> goes<00:03:54.530> straight<00:03:55.130> across<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.700> all<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
signal goes straight across to all the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.300 
signal goes straight across to all the
Pistons<00:03:56.300> powers<00:03:56.750> them<00:03:56.900> all<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:57.260> up<00:03:57.769> pop<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
Pistons powers them all and up pop the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.880 
Pistons powers them all and up pop the
balance<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:02.390> that's<00:04:03.230> pretty<00:04:03.410> much<00:04:03.530> all<00:04:03.769> there

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
balance and that's pretty much all there

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.340 
balance and that's pretty much all there
is<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.250> if<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.390> have<00:04:05.540> any<00:04:05.690> questions<00:04:06.170> or
