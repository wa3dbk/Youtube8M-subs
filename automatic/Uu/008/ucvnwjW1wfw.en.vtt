because<00:01:00.359> there's<00:01:00.690> no<00:01:00.930> dark<00:01:01.199> guide<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.530> don't

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because there's no dark guide you don't

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.779

have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> worry<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.399> getting<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.760> over

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
have to worry about it getting all over

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
have to worry about it getting all over
the<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:04.260> blends<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.949> skin

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.060 
the place it just blends into your skin
pretty<00:01:05.519> quickly<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.939> any<00:01:06.240> gel<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
pretty quickly like any gel would and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
pretty quickly like any gel would and
then<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> don't<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.880> wait<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.240> long<00:01:09.270> for

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
then you don't have to wait too long for

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
then you don't have to wait too long for
it<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> dry<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.799> dries<00:01:11.430> completely<00:01:11.640> in

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
but like I said the only thing was is a
little<00:01:42.659> orange<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> don't<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.430> lot<00:01:44.640> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
little orange but I don't think a lot of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.569 
little orange but I don't think a lot of
people<00:01:45.030> would<00:01:45.119> notice<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.540> definitely<00:01:46.049> noticed

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
people would notice I definitely noticed

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
people would notice I definitely noticed
but<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.030> does<00:01:48.240> start<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> fade<00:01:49.140> after

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
but then it does start to fade after

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760 
but then it does start to fade after
about<00:01:49.950> 3<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> 4<00:01:50.670> days<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.689> fades<00:01:52.350> really

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
about 3 to 4 days and it's fades really

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
about 3 to 4 days and it's fades really
streaky<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> noticed<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> legs<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.600> was

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

product<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> guys<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.740> try<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.790> said

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
product for you guys to try like I said

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.660 
product for you guys to try like I said
it<00:02:18.120> smells<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> manlier<00:02:19.260> side<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.340> color

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
is a good color at the medium so you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.530 
is a good color at the medium so you
won't<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:23.070> too<00:02:23.460> dark<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.090> too<00:02:24.360> light

won't get too dark but not too light
either<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:25.080> definitely<00:02:25.470> worth<00:02:25.590> your<00:02:25.770> while
