00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's a bit like the spring except it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
it's a bit like the spring except it's
just<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:26.550> much<00:00:27.000> simpler<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.900> when

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
just very very much simpler to do when

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.800 
just very very much simpler to do when
it's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.550> flash<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.359> sort

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.220 
it's not so that's a flash it's a sort
of<00:00:30.840> casual<00:00:31.349> move<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.969> maybe

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
of casual move to do that you know maybe

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.080 
of casual move to do that you know maybe

to be doing with this you're just going

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.710 
to be doing with this you're just going
to<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.780> applying<00:02:15.230> pressure<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.970> deck<00:02:17.300> okay

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
to be applying pressure to the deck okay

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.000 
to be applying pressure to the deck okay
you're<00:02:17.990> going<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.290> creating<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.770> bit<00:02:18.920> of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
you're going to be creating a bit of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
you're going to be creating a bit of
tension<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> um<00:02:21.020> when<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.040> when<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.400> do

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
tension so that um when you when you do

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.420 
tension so that um when you when you do
taking<00:02:23.840> off<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.020> cards<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.280> be

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
taking off the cards it's going to be

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
taking off the cards it's going to be
easy<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:26.620> release<00:02:27.620> them<00:02:27.920> ok<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.120> chit

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
easy to release them ok so just chit

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
easy to release them ok so just chit
just<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.960> you're<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.200> applying<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
just like this you're just applying a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.530 
just like this you're just applying a
bit<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.100> bit<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.940> pressure<00:02:32.210> here<00:02:32.690> ok<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:35.000> so

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
bit a bit of pressure here ok and now so

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.900 
bit a bit of pressure here ok and now so
here's<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.050> move<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.880> basically<00:02:37.880> all

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
here's the move all right basically all

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.180 
here's the move all right basically all
you're<00:02:38.210> doing<00:02:38.600> is<00:02:38.780> you're<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.190> releasing

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
you're doing is you're just releasing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.580 
you're doing is you're just releasing
pressure<00:02:40.460> with<00:02:41.360> these<00:02:41.540> two<00:02:41.750> fingers<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
pressure with these two fingers and the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.960 
pressure with these two fingers and the
thumb<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:43.670> slowly<00:02:44.180> releasing<00:02:44.960> pressure<00:02:45.230> and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
thumb is slowly releasing pressure and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.040 
thumb is slowly releasing pressure and
this<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> what<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.750> looks<00:02:47.900> like

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
this is this is what it looks like

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.640 
this is this is what it looks like
slowly<00:02:48.440> just<00:02:49.420> slowly<00:02:50.420> releasing<00:02:51.380> pressure

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
slowly just slowly releasing pressure

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.180 
slowly just slowly releasing pressure
with<00:02:52.130> these<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:52.850> these<00:02:52.880> fingers<00:02:53.420> ok<00:02:54.260> which

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
with these with these fingers ok which

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.450 
with these with these fingers ok which
will<00:02:55.400> call<00:02:55.670> us<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.090> cards<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.560> drop<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
will call us the cards to drop on the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.710 
will call us the cards to drop on the
bottom<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.990> top<00:03:00.020> ok<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.420> I'll<00:03:02.420> show

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
bottom the top ok like that I'll show

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.970 
bottom the top ok like that I'll show
you<00:03:02.780> again<00:03:03.820> be<00:03:04.820> slowly<00:03:05.710> releasing<00:03:06.710> pressure

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
you again be slowly releasing pressure

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.400 
you again be slowly releasing pressure
so<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.000> those<00:03:08.330> cards<00:03:09.430> from<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.550> bottom<00:03:11.410> will

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
so that those cards from the bottom will

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.030 
so that those cards from the bottom will
just<00:03:12.830> fall<00:03:13.450> into<00:03:14.450> your<00:03:14.720> hand<00:03:14.959> over<00:03:15.170> here<00:03:15.530> ok

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
just fall into your hand over here ok

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
just just carries the cards I guess they

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.170 
just just carries the cards I guess they
just<00:03:28.850> let<00:03:29.239> us<00:03:29.360> fall<00:03:29.660> into<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.110> hand<00:03:30.410> here<00:03:30.709> I'm
