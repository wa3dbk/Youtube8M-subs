00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
 2 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:12.110
 I would like to talk about how to grow Russian sage this time 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.700
 This is a kind of fellow Russian Sage that Salvia 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.490
 Light blue purple 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.460
 6 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.710
 And is these sub-machine bloom the color of the flower 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.829
 Anyway, the feature is this 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.349
 It's this leaves leaves of this jagged 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.349
 And a little bit unique 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.720
 I wonder if close to mint Toka skin Toka time 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.900
 Yes is the plants of such a scent 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 this 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:54.940
 It is a Russian sage The biggest feature is that it is very strong in the cold This is taken this video 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:59.090
 The place I'm in is Iwate Prefecture, but it's very cold in the area, which can be Iwatake minus 20 degrees 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 Winter is also a monkey hair that can hand also in such places but is 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 It's minor and I 'm sure 20-30 degrees 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 20 of the and strong about the Do not feel say selfish 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:17.100
 Those plants that are strong against the cold of the cup are often common, but in thickness 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.399
 There is a tendency to be slightly weak 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.030
 Russia's politics are not so weak in the morning, but the main enemy is the rainy season 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.730
 is 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:34.940
 It's almost time for the cat to become black and black and get rotten 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:36.230
 Go and to work wonders shake, particularly at the guy was or result ventilation is poor location that is a Daikage 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.730
 Rotten 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.380
 Leaves 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:50.150
 It turns yellowish, it turns black, it drops and rots 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:56.550
 Please planting as much as possible airy place in the may affect the whole stock 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:02.560
 I think it is better to plant in a well-ventilated place than plant in a cool place 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:08.380
 After Russian sage, I will go over winter in this form as it is 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.539
 So the branch remains and the branch armor remains and the sprout comes out from this branch the next year 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:17.040
 U 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:18.030
 It is not a growing plant because it is a growing plant, but it gets bigger gradually 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.860
 Come 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.360
 And I want to open a little this skin around since 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:32.910
 It is still winter, so even if the leaves fall and only branches are alive 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:39.970
 Please be careful so as not to buy to the root that all 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:44.350
 And it is superb at in even-St to it and become large stock market and split it is a cat of blue flowers 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:50.020
 I mean bunches or rather have is I ne one of'm nice flowers 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.640
 So Silver of Sico in Do leaves say a little way silver baggage even when viewed from that transparent Poi 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:59.819
 8 Since the leaves to Groom flowers shine 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:04.440
 By all means because it is a plant that can be used for such a feeling or rather garden of intimidation symbol tree 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.160
 How about planting, how about growing Russian sage this time 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.160
 You talk
