00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 I never heard of the fact that this 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.250

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.270
 the pastor's mason is justino of 50 years and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.390
 it was in the bible that the pastor saw that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.060
 could have other women someone 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.670
 prove to me only where it was 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 It is forbidden for a man to have more than one woman. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.619
 few people attend church services. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.670
 mason who presents himself as a shepherd 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.430
 about 12 people in his own accounts and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 was in coexistence with the faithful who 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 justino was involved in another case 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 extra-marital relationship happened after a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.920
 woman who lives in the neighborhood told 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.100
 he had a dream that he had in the house 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 her gospel music can be heard 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 From a distance the woman has four children. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 married and prefers not to appear she said that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.580
 He dreamed that have children with one pastor 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.790
 revelation i will not do it 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.880
 she has nowhere to run her husband too 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.560
 I talked to the pastor, I thought. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 with me if that's God's will 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.869
 It would be done right after we got in. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 prayer asking god for mercy 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 because it would be the most difficult thing in the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.280
 my life 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.950
 what to make that decision take a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 woman with whom she has husband the shepherd 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.920
 is also married how to explain in the bible 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 chapters 3 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.619
 this prophet a man like us and said 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.020
 goodbye commanded to take a wife and commit adultery 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.990
 if you are talking about adultery when you hear 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 adulterous word receive this woman who 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.360
 It was the double, it's not like that, there's no one here. 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.770
 saying here it goes again 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.890

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.759
 adulterous at will 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.300
 adulteress is no adult has a being that 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.300
 it works 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.340
 there was a misinterpretation a 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.290
 shelter would not be referring to a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.900
 adulterous woman lets see and not for what 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.370
