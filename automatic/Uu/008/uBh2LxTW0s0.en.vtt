hi<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.580> AJ<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:03.629> 39<00:00:04.080> years<00:00:04.230> old<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.100> suffer

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hi I'm AJ I'm 39 years old and I suffer

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.270 
hi I'm AJ I'm 39 years old and I suffer
from<00:00:05.549> Parkinson's<00:00:05.819> disease<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.870> was<00:00:07.830> diagnosed

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
from Parkinson's disease I was diagnosed

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.680 
from Parkinson's disease I was diagnosed
four<00:00:08.550> years<00:00:08.790> ago<00:00:09.000> when<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.840> thin<00:00:10.290> five<00:00:10.559> and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
four years ago when I was thin five and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.390 
four years ago when I was thin five and
I've<00:00:12.690> since<00:00:13.200> undergone<00:00:13.679> deep<00:00:14.219> brain

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I've since undergone deep brain

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.720 
I've since undergone deep brain
stimulation<00:00:14.969> surgery<00:00:16.160> this<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> procedure

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
stimulation surgery this is a procedure

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.050 
stimulation surgery this is a procedure
whereby<00:00:18.410> two<00:00:19.410> probes<00:00:19.680> dropped<00:00:20.100> deep<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.939> my

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
whereby two probes dropped deep into my

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.349 
whereby two probes dropped deep into my
brain<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> hooked<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.470> via<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:23.760> wire<00:00:24.180> down

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
brain and hooked up via a wire down

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.349 
brain and hooked up via a wire down
meaning<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> pacemaker<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.010> my<00:00:26.160> chest<00:00:26.430> this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
meaning to a pacemaker in my chest this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.290 
meaning to a pacemaker in my chest this
provides<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.170> steady<00:00:28.410> stream<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.830> electricity

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
provides a steady stream of electricity

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
provides a steady stream of electricity
to<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.449> brain<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.850> per<00:00:32.850> second<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.430> there's<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
to my brain and per second so there's a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.650 
to my brain and per second so there's a
major<00:00:36.360> effect<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.020> life<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.420> major

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
major effect on my life and and a major

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.869 
major effect on my life and and a major
effect<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.379> my<00:00:40.530> family's<00:00:40.890> life<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
effect on my family's life which is the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.500 
effect on my family's life which is the
main<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.969> today<00:00:44.969> I'd<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> show

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
main thing and today I'd like to show

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
main thing and today I'd like to show
you<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.719> happens<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> check<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.500> neuro

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you what happens when I check my neuro

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
you what happens when I check my neuro
stimulator<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.989> now<00:00:49.460> it's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.670> after<00:00:50.969> 11:00

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
stimulator off now it's just after 11:00

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.279 
stimulator off now it's just after 11:00
a.m.<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:53.000> time<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.360> hit<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.750> second

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
a.m. so it's time that I hit my second

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.689 
a.m. so it's time that I hit my second
dose<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> medication<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> morning

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
dose of medication for the morning

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
dose of medication for the morning
and<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.449> Facebook<00:00:57.809> dose<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.410> much

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and so my Facebook dose is pretty much

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
and so my Facebook dose is pretty much
all<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.129> off<00:00:59.250> so<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> good

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
all but one off so this is a good

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
all but one off so this is a good
example<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.739> I'd<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.430> might<00:01:02.640> be

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
example of what I'd be like I might be

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.780 
example of what I'd be like I might be
sort<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.890> with<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.070> medication<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.700> my

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sort of off off with no medication in my

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
sort of off off with no medication in my
system<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.750> no<00:01:07.740> power<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:09.570> show<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
system and no power to show you the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
system and no power to show you the
dramatic<00:01:10.710> effect<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:12.600> will<00:01:13.580> demonstrate<00:01:14.580> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
dramatic effect I will demonstrate this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.139 
dramatic effect I will demonstrate this
is<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> power<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.849 

I'm<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:24.899> making<00:01:26.240> happy<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.420> faces<00:01:28.020> for

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
I'm not making happy little faces for

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.099 
I'm not making happy little faces for
the<00:01:28.920> video<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.579> are<00:01:29.789> tests<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
the video these are tests that the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.270 
the video these are tests that the
neurologists<00:01:31.799> make<00:01:32.159> us<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:34.829> test<00:01:35.069> our

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
neurologists make us do to test our

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.200 
neurologists make us do to test our
reflexes<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:37.049> they're<00:01:37.319> wiggling

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
reflexes as you can see they're wiggling

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.190 
reflexes as you can see they're wiggling
making<00:01:39.210> 5<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.459> got<00:01:41.789> very<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.479> movement

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
making 5 and I've got very good movement

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
making 5 and I've got very good movement
and<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:48.170> remote<00:01:49.170> control<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and this is the remote control and this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.969 
and this is the remote control and this
chicks<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.569> time<00:01:54.719> on<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.099> okay<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
chicks a time on on and okay and this is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.170 
chicks a time on on and okay and this is
me<00:02:05.840> watching<00:02:06.840> enough

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.490 

you<00:02:12.180> won't<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.510> read<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.140> checking

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you won't really read that it's checking

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
you won't really read that it's checking
too<00:02:13.650> much<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.000> almost<00:02:15.240> an<00:02:15.540> instantaneous

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
too much so it's almost an instantaneous

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.670 
too much so it's almost an instantaneous
reaction<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:18.260> can't<00:02:19.260> control<00:02:20.220> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.979 

it<00:02:26.280> shook<00:02:26.609> some<00:02:26.819> quality<00:02:27.209> cocktails<00:02:27.659> with<00:02:27.870> the

it shook some quality cocktails with the
right<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:29.370> left<00:02:29.549> just<00:02:30.180> looks<00:02:30.959> like<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
right the left just looks like the

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:40.399 
right the left just looks like the
writer<00:02:31.680> wave<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:35.370> voice<00:02:35.609> is<00:02:37.670> gone<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.409> harder

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
writer wave my voice is gone it's harder

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.740 
writer wave my voice is gone it's harder
for<00:02:40.439> me<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.829> keep<00:02:41.010> he<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.879> words<00:02:42.239> out<00:02:42.540> and

speak completely rigid and if I try to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.780 
speak completely rigid and if I try to

stand up at fall if anyone thinks I'm

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.929 
stand up at fall if anyone thinks I'm
faking<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.409> I'm<00:02:55.409> not<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:57.409> can't<00:02:58.609> control<00:02:59.609> the

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
faking this I'm not I can't control the

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.440 
faking this I'm not I can't control the
trimmers<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.519> dyskinesia<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.849> twisting<00:03:03.299> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
trimmers in dyskinesia the twisting and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.509 
trimmers in dyskinesia the twisting and
when<00:03:03.599> he<00:03:03.720> has<00:03:04.579> called<00:03:05.579> dystonia<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.810> there's

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
when he has called dystonia and there's

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.140 
when he has called dystonia and there's
really<00:03:08.519> quite<00:03:08.879> uncomfortable<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.849> as<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.090> can
