 Today we show how to make a caste 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.740
 We prepared that so in the end 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.740
 appearance 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.220
 we need one for the cast places 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.520
 live larger cake 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.739
 there should be three parts in one 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.780
 you can see another video of me 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.670
 how to prepare cake soil yourself 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 First we cut a small one 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:56.350
 Rectangle from this cake in front of balls 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:01:02.350
 got up against the first script 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.539
 a front places distribute the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 pies chandler the second layer on the 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.610
 pie crust on it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:42.680
 and again torben chandler 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:46.270
 for that now shares the last layer as 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.509
 Next we suffer a small rectangle 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.820
 out again and distribute as again 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.820
 in the back a little pies creme 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.250
 In this area more dry cream 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.250
 use to achieve an increase 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.700
 now put the smaller rectangles on it 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.519
 and dry cream forgive on it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.710

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:36.840
 chandler again with cake soil 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:38.460
 this will be the front side 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.540
 You are very beautiful as you can see 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.210
 created an increase 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.060
 Now we will be in front and behind 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.060
 obscure the rest of the cake 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.019
 Now we will be using the surface 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.660
 Beat cream with red food coloring 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.660
 to paint mixed 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 because we climbed a bit 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.500
 now we will do that for at least two 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.930
 put in the fridge for hours 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.970
 after the pie is chilled we become 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.370
 Decorate the surface with motifs 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.310
 For that we need punch chandler once 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:52.120

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.090

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.099

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.069
