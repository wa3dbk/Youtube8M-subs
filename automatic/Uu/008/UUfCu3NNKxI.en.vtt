to do is remove the body then let's take

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.810 
to do is remove the body then let's take
a<00:00:41.260> look<00:00:41.530> at<00:00:41.650> this<00:00:42.630> you<00:00:43.630> see<00:00:44.250> how<00:00:45.250> loose<00:00:45.550> that

a look at this you see how loose that

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.240 
a look at this you see how loose that
front<00:00:46.180> end<00:00:46.390> is<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.320> wheels<00:00:47.590> could<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:48.040> front

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
front end is the wheels could the front

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.620 
front end is the wheels could the front
wheels<00:00:48.430> can<00:00:48.640> go<00:00:48.730> up<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.090> down<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.570> that's

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.970 
wheels can go up and down and that's
really<00:00:49.780> going<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.290> affect<00:00:50.380> our<00:00:50.830> performance

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
really going to affect our performance

whole front end would raise up I don't
want<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.940> raise<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.270> front<00:01:49.539> end<00:01:49.750> any<00:01:50.020> higher

want to raise the front end any higher

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.820 
want to raise the front end any higher
than<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.369> already<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.200> don't<00:01:56.349> want<00:01:56.770> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
there taken this up got rid of the noise

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.370 
there taken this up got rid of the noise
and<00:02:15.190> there's<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:17.020> made<00:02:17.349> a

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
little noise so I'm gonna have to adjust

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.559 
little noise so I'm gonna have to adjust
when<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:21.190> side<00:02:21.489> done<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.180> may<00:02:22.360> not

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
when you get one side done you may not

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.270 
when you get one side done you may not
have<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.290> other<00:02:23.440> side<00:02:23.680> may<00:02:23.830> have<00:02:23.860> gone

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
have the the other side may have gone

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.570 
have the the other side may have gone
out<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.520> alignment<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.780> there<00:02:26.110> my<00:02:27.069> front<00:02:27.340> ends

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
out of alignment so there my front ends

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.000 
out of alignment so there my front ends
not<00:02:27.730> moving<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.900> see<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.410> not<00:02:29.530> moving<00:02:29.770> up

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
not moving you see this is not moving up

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.330 
not moving you see this is not moving up
and<00:02:30.160> down<00:02:30.780> I've<00:02:31.780> got<00:02:32.050> I'm<00:02:32.380> not<00:02:32.770> hearing<00:02:33.190> any

noise<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.060> don't<00:02:34.239> feel<00:02:34.599> any<00:02:34.810> movement<00:02:35.020> well

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
noise and I don't feel any movement well

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.920 
noise and I don't feel any movement well
just<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:36.130> bit<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.730> so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.640 

I<00:02:42.290> hear<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.709> there<00:02:42.860> don't<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:44.349> shall<00:02:45.349> left<00:02:45.560> it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
I hear it there don't I I shall left it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.399 
I hear it there don't I I shall left it
alone<00:02:48.879> okay<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:50.269> there<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.450> are<00:02:50.659> no<00:02:50.870> movement

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
alone okay so there we are no movement

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.930 
alone okay so there we are no movement
when<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.530> press<00:02:51.799> down<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:52.190> there<00:02:52.370> no<00:02:52.580> movement

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
when I press down on there no movement

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.289 
when I press down on there no movement
in<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.060> front<00:02:53.239> end<00:02:53.569> that<00:02:53.950> means<00:02:54.950> my<00:02:55.250> axle<00:02:55.730> is

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
in the front end that means my axle is

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.990 
in the front end that means my axle is
sitting<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:56.810> high<00:02:56.989> up<00:02:57.349> in<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.560> chassis<00:02:58.159> as<00:02:58.700> it

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
sitting as high up in the chassis as it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.449 
sitting as high up in the chassis as it
needs<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.450> be<00:02:59.750> now<00:03:00.530> what<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.709> want<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.010> do<00:03:01.159> is

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
needs to be now what I want to do is

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.750 
needs to be now what I want to do is
adjust<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.629> bottom<00:03:03.019> ones<00:03:03.489> because<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.519> still

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
adjust the bottom ones because I still

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.690 
adjust the bottom ones because I still
have<00:03:05.000> play<00:03:05.739> if<00:03:06.739> we<00:03:06.890> take<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.069> look<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.489> I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
have play if we take a look at this I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.020 
have play if we take a look at this I
still<00:03:08.269> have<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.629> play<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.799> know<00:03:10.030> that

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
still have that play but I know that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.229 
still have that play but I know that
I've<00:03:11.599> eliminated<00:03:11.989> how<00:03:12.590> far<00:03:12.890> up<00:03:13.190> my<00:03:13.519> axle<00:03:14.090> can

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
I've eliminated how far up my axle can

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.150 
I've eliminated how far up my axle can
go<00:03:14.390> now<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:14.660> need<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.079> eliminate<00:03:15.260> how<00:03:15.709> far<00:03:15.950> down

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
go now I need to eliminate how far down

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180 
go now I need to eliminate how far down
over<00:03:16.519> go<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.000> need<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.989> just<00:03:18.379> position<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:18.980> right

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
over go I need to just position it right

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.710 
over go I need to just position it right
there<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.549> I<00:03:19.609> can<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:19.879> that<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.269> bottom

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
there and I can do that with this bottom

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.890 
there and I can do that with this bottom
one<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.620> taken<00:03:25.069> these<00:03:25.190> screws<00:03:25.519> up<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
one so I just taken these screws up and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.569 
one so I just taken these screws up and
one<00:03:30.079> one<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.349> way<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.500> do<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.159> I<00:03:31.250> usually

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
one one the way I do it is I usually

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.979 
one one the way I do it is I usually
just<00:03:31.700> spin<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> axle<00:03:32.420> until<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.720> stops

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
just spin the axle until it stops

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.180 
just spin the axle until it stops
spinning<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:35.019> then<00:03:36.019> back<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:36.920> stops

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
spinning and then back so it stops

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.140 
spinning and then back so it stops
spinning<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.909> then<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.060> back<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.599> up<00:03:38.750> oh<00:03:40.150> eighth

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
spinning and then I back it up oh eighth

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.390 
spinning and then I back it up oh eighth
to<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> quarter<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.959> turn<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.590> again<00:03:43.159> you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to a quarter of a turn and again you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.500 
to a quarter of a turn and again you
have<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.579> do<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.760> same<00:03:43.940> thing<00:03:44.150> where<00:03:44.299> you<00:03:44.390> have

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
have to do the same thing where you have

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.509 
have to do the same thing where you have
to<00:03:44.659> go<00:03:45.290> back<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.709> forth<00:03:45.919> between<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.370> two

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
to go back and forth between the two

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.680 
to go back and forth between the two
screws<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:48.019> make<00:03:48.230> sure<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.620> you've<00:03:48.799> got<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
screws and make sure that you've got the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.150 
screws and make sure that you've got the
axle<00:03:51.109> in<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.380> position<00:03:51.650> where<00:03:51.859> it's<00:03:52.010> not

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
axle in a position where it's not

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.490 
axle in a position where it's not
binding<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.510> yet<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:56.030> it's<00:03:56.480> staying<00:03:57.260> right

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
binding and yet it's it's staying right

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.839 
binding and yet it's it's staying right
where<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.799> want<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> stay<00:03:58.400> where<00:03:58.609> it's<00:03:58.700> not

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
where you want it to stay where it's not

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.210 
where you want it to stay where it's not
moving<00:03:59.239> up<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.510> down<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.470> if<00:04:00.530> we<00:04:00.650> look<00:04:00.829> at<00:04:00.919> this

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.800 

it's<00:04:04.220> not<00:04:04.340> moving<00:04:04.879> up<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.090> can't<00:04:05.329> move<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.690> up

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
it's not moving up I can't move it up

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.569 
it's not moving up I can't move it up
and<00:04:05.989> down<00:04:06.049> I<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.530> get<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:06.919> little<00:04:07.160> side-to-side

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
and down I do get a little side-to-side

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.920 
and down I do get a little side-to-side
movement<00:04:09.639> but<00:04:10.639> what<00:04:10.819> I'm<00:04:10.940> concerned<00:04:11.269> about<00:04:11.449> is

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
movement but what I'm concerned about is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.229 
movement but what I'm concerned about is
the<00:04:12.260> wheel<00:04:12.739> going<00:04:12.949> up<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.579> down<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:14.120> the

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
the wheel going up and down in the

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.500 
the wheel going up and down in the
chassis<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:17.329> then<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.560> spinning<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:20.389> was

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
chassis and then it's spinning it was

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.240 
chassis and then it's spinning it was
just<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:21.019> little<00:04:21.289> tight<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.709> I'm<00:04:21.769> gonna<00:04:21.919> just

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
just a little tight so I'm gonna just

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.589 
just a little tight so I'm gonna just
loosen<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.820> just<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.630> oh<00:04:26.830> that's<00:04:27.830> nice<00:04:28.599> now

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
loosen it I just just oh that's nice now

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.120 
loosen it I just just oh that's nice now
I<00:04:29.660> could<00:04:29.840> put<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.990> little<00:04:30.199> drop<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> oil<00:04:30.830> on

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
I could put a little drop of oil on

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
I could put a little drop of oil on
either<00:04:31.250> side<00:04:31.580> there<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.550> what<00:04:37.699> I'm<00:04:37.820> doing<00:04:37.849> is

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
either side there so what I'm doing is

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.379 
either side there so what I'm doing is
oiling<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.750> both<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.110> top<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.560> bottom

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
oiling the both the top and the bottom

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.330 
oiling the both the top and the bottom
of<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.750> axle<00:04:42.260> I'm<00:04:42.560> just<00:04:42.800> putting<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:43.130> on<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
of the axle I'm just putting it on the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.129 
of the axle I'm just putting it on the
top<00:04:43.550> but<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:43.820> oil<00:04:44.030> will<00:04:44.330> rotate<00:04:44.630> around<00:04:44.900> to

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
top but the oil will rotate around to

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.860 
top but the oil will rotate around to
the<00:04:45.229> bottom<00:04:45.440> oh<00:04:45.970> yeah<00:04:47.979> so<00:04:48.979> that's<00:04:49.130> really<00:04:49.400> nice

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the bottom oh yeah so that's really nice

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.959 
the bottom oh yeah so that's really nice
so<00:04:50.870> my<00:04:51.169> axle<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.590> now<00:04:51.770> nice<00:04:52.159> and<00:04:52.190> set
