so now we are designing a one house for
a<00:03:27.019> forty<00:03:27.709> millions<00:03:28.220> forty<00:03:28.820> millions<00:03:29.180> just

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
a forty millions forty millions just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.430 
a forty millions forty millions just
fourteen<00:03:29.870> millions

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
fourteen millions

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.590 
fourteen millions
well<00:03:30.950> because<00:03:31.310> bamboo<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.700> very<00:03:31.940> cheap<00:03:32.330> and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
well because bamboo is very cheap and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.840 
well because bamboo is very cheap and
easy<00:03:32.810> construction<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.220> perfect<00:03:34.640> for<00:03:34.700> a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
easy construction so it's perfect for a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.320 
easy construction so it's perfect for a
guy<00:03:35.030> like<00:03:35.239> me<00:03:35.650> when<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.130> enough<00:03:37.790> money<00:03:37.820> I
