today<00:00:02.909> I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.540> video<00:00:03.780> how

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
today I'm going to show you a video how

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.980 
today I'm going to show you a video how
to<00:00:04.650> get<00:00:05.160> your<00:00:05.339> games<00:00:05.580> back<00:00:05.879> showing<00:00:06.600> up<00:00:06.750> in

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
to get your games back showing up in

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.580 
to get your games back showing up in
your<00:00:07.730> multi<00:00:08.730> mounts<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.300> basically<00:00:09.809> if<00:00:10.349> you're

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
your multi mounts so basically if you're

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.560 
your multi mounts so basically if you're
a<00:00:10.650> different<00:00:10.950> firmware<00:00:11.190> than<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:12.179> you're<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
a different firmware than what you're I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.140 
a different firmware than what you're I
think<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:13.110> sure<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> ps3<00:00:14.580> either<00:00:14.849> but

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
think not sure I'm a ps3 either but

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.800 
think not sure I'm a ps3 either but
anyway<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:16.590> games<00:00:16.830> wouldn't<00:00:17.310> show<00:00:17.550> up

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
anyway so the games wouldn't show up

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.240 
anyway so the games wouldn't show up
automatically<00:00:18.810> simply<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.560> multi-man

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
automatically simply because multi-man

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.750 
automatically simply because multi-man
has<00:00:20.460> different<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.949> different<00:00:22.949> location<00:00:23.369> where

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
has different a different location where

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.420 
has different a different location where
it<00:00:24.090> saves<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.630> backup<00:00:25.050> games<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.680> for

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it saves your backup games so for

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.029 
it saves your backup games so for
instance<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.090> mw3<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.680> click<00:00:28.949> on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
instance I've here mw3 and have click on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
instance I've here mw3 and have click on
there<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.250> try<00:00:30.150> again<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.539> clicking<00:00:30.779> copy

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and I slide my hard drive my ps3 it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.750 
and I slide my hard drive my ps3 it
would<00:00:34.469> copy<00:00:34.710> over<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> different<00:00:35.610> location

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
would copy over in a different location

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.940 
would copy over in a different location
and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.510> wouldn't<00:00:36.809> show<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> list
