00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello how about my dearest colleagues of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 youtube today I bring you a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.460
 tutorial on how to format a memory 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.340
 usb in the mac operating system in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.950
 a mac computer is pretty easy 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 pretty simple and then here are the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 steps normally when we come from 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 windows operating system so what 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 first thing we do is look for the option 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 with the right click and search here the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 option to format in this case it is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 something different but it does not stop being 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.700
 simple in this case we have to go to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.100
 give finder ' after 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 in applications find the folder 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 utilities 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.590
 in utilities we look for utility of 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 discs that are here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 then he's going to throw us here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 window in which it appears to us then 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.600
 our albums as you can see here 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
 is my hard drive that in this case 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.420
 I will not touch anymore I do not intend to do anything 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 in it and in this case is the usb memory 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.770
 it is a small memory of 4.11 and bytes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.870
 so then no 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.750
 there will be no problem in terms of 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.300
 late a lot and those things and good 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.210
 starting here is the memory these two 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.700
 they cover the same memory they are not no 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.610
 I have two memories is the same then 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.640
 well let's work on this let's go 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.390
 to the option to delete tab that then 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.820
 we are formatting here the format that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.310
 handles this memory is the ms 2 pad that 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 It is the ideal format when we work 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.610
 moving files from a computer 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.230
 windows machine 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 but the disadvantage that this 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.400
 format is that the files 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.990
 the maximum size of the files that 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.290
 we can put in a memory with this 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 format is 4 gigabytes then yes 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.580
 we work with large file archives 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.150
 heavy because it would not do us any good 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.310
 this format in our case then we 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.010
 would be better if we are working 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.470
 mac amac use mac or that format 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.150
 plus there is no limit we can put 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 20 gig files and we always want 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.420
 and when our memory supports it 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 then he changed the format 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 also so that they see how and then if 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.370
 they want to change the name for example you 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.790
 I'm going to put 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.290
 usb tutorial 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.629
 then already here we change the format 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.069
 we change the name and good in options 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.140
 of security I always give you one step 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.790
 here so that to erase all the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.189
 memory references everything that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.519
 I did it because when formatting 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:42.000
 normal because the memory if it is empty 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.670
 but simply because the files that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.049
 we had there before then there are programs 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 with which we can recover 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.609
 so then I in this case when I go 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.650
 to fix a memory I will lend it 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.510
 or something like that I prefer to do this for 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.340
 delete all references of what 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.639
 have done in said memory simply 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.870
 for personal safety but then in this 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.970
 case the memory is new in everything 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.980
 so then it has no case that we want 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.099
 from here I recommend that in one step 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.890
 and if you are interested because here below gives them 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.990
 the description of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.319
 What does each of the steps consist of? 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.550
 The more steps, the longer the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:23.610
 format but then there really is time 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.220
 then once we have the format 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.410
 that we will give the name in case of 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.830
 that we changed it because it would only be 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.450
 to poke here where it says delete erase 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.670
 all the data and format the disk 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 then we pricked you here asked us 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.350
 that if we are sure if we are 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.810
 sure we do it if not then not and already 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.560
 erase as you can see here is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.260
 disassembling the disk creating partition 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.730
 in a few moments it does not take long since 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.380
 to be our memory with the new 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.380
 format and the new name 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.620
 As you can see, it's quite simple, 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.620
 it takes a long time 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.900
 and then anyone could do it alone 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.580
 it's just to know where to do it good 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 look how you can see here is already the 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.709
 memory with the new name 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.709
 I just need to finish 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.060
 You have already completed the process and we can 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.639
 use our memory again with the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.680
 new format a new empty name 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.090
 and in case you give it the steps of 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.610
 security we have our memory 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.610
 empty and safe here is getting 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.819
 information in the format no longer us 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.040
 mark climactic that plus and then the 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.490
 capacity 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.350
 and as you can see it is a is a 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.500
 simple procedure has nothing of 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.180
 complications anyone can do 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.540
 and as for my part it is all I wish them 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.270
 has any doubt or suggestion been 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.520
 the comments and well thank you very much 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.760
 I hope everything goes well with 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.880
 computers your memories and I wish you 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.880
 luck
