Learn how to import SMS and Whatsapp messages to your iPhone

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
Before you begin, you should know that:

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.400
1. You need to have 2 backups: one with the messages you want to import and a fresh new backup with iTunes

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You can import messages from iOS8 to 9, but for an older iOS we recommend the same version

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You can also use password protected iTunes backups and even import messages coming from an iCloud backup

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Note that messages from your newest backup will be replaced with the messages from the older backup.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Open the backup that contains the SMS you're looking for. Click on Expert Mode and go to:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Home, Domain, Library SMS, and extract the sms.db file to an easy to remember path.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Next, open your new backup and use Expert Mode to browse to the same location.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Get to the sms.db file  and select Replace

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.200
Browse and select the old backup original sms.db file. You'll get a confirmation once the file is successfuly replaced

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.700
Importing WhatsApp messages is the same as importing SMS

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:34.200
From Expert Mode go to Application Domains, pick the WhatsApp group and extract the chatstorage.sqlite file in a folder of your choice

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.500
Then, find your new backup and get the chatstorage.sqlite file.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Right click, select "Replace" ,and you will just need to find the file you previously extracted.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
The last step is to open iTunes and Restore the latest backup you made

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:20.000
