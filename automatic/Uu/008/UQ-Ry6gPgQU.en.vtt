00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.210
 later the second in her league West and Inga Pasquale from the wagon 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.210
 Incidents have Winfried it was the TV from Bremen 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.589
 the hall the last games were unsuccessful 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.900
 why today in the duty in front of about 300 spectators in the Einsiedler Bachthaler 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 to win the game 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.730
 and they also put on a great start 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.310
 The Bremen went with 0 2 in the lead but it was then immediately 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.580
 An answer and have by Jakob Faas and Timo Tomas with their 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720
 three races allowed the lead of 6 024 in advance 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.789
 here the 8 2 for us we finally have Markus reward 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 the Bremen shortened to 18 4 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.020
 Sascha Lackner's toes to 4 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.520
 the Bremer with the 10 2 6 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.490
 Boris Worm long turns his free throws to 12 to 6 and Timo Thomas 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.600
 increased to 6 on the title 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 Vegesacker TV can come to Neumann in these matches on 14 but 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740
 Do not stop lazy from doing so 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.940
 to expand their leadership 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.070
 Outstanding in the first quarter Playing Team Mutu has to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.330
 targeted 8 points in a row Windows place thus the 22 to 11 lead for the VfL 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.500
 what Muzio's clients had to 24 to 13 have a comfortable guide 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.040
 of 11 points 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.260
 However, one had the impression that they wanted to rest a little 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 and that had the Bremer ice cold 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.360
 VfL did not manage to score a single goal and the Bremen team pressed hard 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.960
 on the gas and could reduce the gap to two points 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 the score was 24:22 after the first quarter 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 Bremen started in the second quarter just as they left off in the first quarter 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.790
 had 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.030
 they played very concentrated and put a lot of pressure on them 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.620
 the defense 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.800
 however, we just have not been in many situations 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.520
 concentrated enough and had too many ball misses and misses in their 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.370
 play 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.210
 The first few minutes of the second quarter were relatively balanced 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.550
 small advantage on the part of Bremer but then turned on the guests and the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.570
 Title one hit at a time 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 under battled thus a lead of 44 2 33 points 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.099
 many have more spectators feared again a defeat of their 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.869
 team 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.080
 that the VfL are still taking place 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.509
 Showing immorality 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:21.259
 they fought back into the game and shortened by this threesome of 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.760
 Jakub Voracek practically with the half-time siren 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.760
 the backlog at 43 to 48 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.689
 in the second half the VfL came into play better and we were young 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:36.389
 were 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.009
 out of his gap of 43 to score 40 points at halftime we played the 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.159
 The charges of coach Niko the same 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.129
 in the third quarter a lead of 7 60 to 66 points 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.760
 11 out of 24 points of the incidents in the third quarter scored against the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.939
 Account of Sascha Rhyner 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
 here hits from Lech to 53 to 50 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.829
 the last quarter of the season it in himself he muses also from underneath 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.919
 and the spectators had to shiver until the last second 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.459
 we go to the last minute of the game the score is 83 even 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.839
 night vision and the VfL is in attack 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.090
 Timo Thomas Cook and Chill two free throws 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.319
 bitter the transform 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.959
 the first seat 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 here's just 80 seconds to play 48 seconds 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.249
 so now the second free throw 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.189
 We are interested again 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.799
 from the eighties 80 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.369
 Brehm attack 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.369
 here she betrays defenders do not allow 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.239
 turn over ball loss 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.239
 Parmalat the ball 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.839
 Play 33 points then leave 80 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.879
 lol on the ball 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.019
 she to the coach 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.509
 weggefault interviewed two 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.099
 the RSC he 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.099
 next to him and also Solace 83 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.269
 Röttgen 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.269
 that's the second one 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.359
 the second sits six lats 83 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.199
 and the terrier of the authorities immediately took a break 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.219
 There are six seconds left then 80 seconds 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.219
 Bremen definitely needs a threesome 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.240
 how do you do that? 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.620
 here triple try 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.020
 next to it Lula has the ball 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.479
 will be liked immediately 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.479
 where can I get free throws here 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.699
 so Birner the two transforms everything completely over 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.240
 11 sec and play 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 Score 6 let the night go by 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.909
 Who is he? 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.610
 7 80 83 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.610
 right now harvest nothing more burning 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.809
 Water the second too 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.789
 No, take that 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 it must now be done very quickly 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.639
 Robert Basic and play 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.229
 two points for Bremen 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.689
 cinematic monthly view but the time is no longer enough 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.089
 Example for the Hessians 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.229
 Fun over 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.169
 VfL Armin Görgens will meet him 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.139
 she is developing from Bremen with 7 80 to 85
