just<00:00:34.710> five<00:00:34.950> supports<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.640> time<00:00:35.850> around

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
just five supports this time around

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
just five supports this time around
allow<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.780> guys<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.530> top<00:00:37.800> five

allow you guys know what my top five
support<00:00:38.430> pics<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.510> I'll<00:00:39.629> mention<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
support pics are and then I'll mention a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
support pics are and then I'll mention a
few<00:00:40.079> supports<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:40.980> also<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.879> damn

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
few supports that are also really damn

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
few supports that are also really damn
strong<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.649> don't<00:00:43.890> play<00:00:44.070> as

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
strong but that I just don't play as

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
strong but that I just don't play as
often<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> probably<00:00:45.030> should<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.079> all

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
often as I probably should all in all

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.720 
often as I probably should all in all
every<00:00:46.680> single<00:00:46.710> champion<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.520> talk<00:00:47.700> about

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
every single champion that I talk about

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
every single champion that I talk about
in<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.270> video<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.809> probably<00:00:49.140> worth<00:00:49.379> getting

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
in this video is probably worth getting

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.260 
in this video is probably worth getting
picked<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.010> every<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> again<00:00:50.789> from<00:00:51.059> now

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
picked up every now and again from now

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
picked up every now and again from now
on<00:00:51.480> I'll<00:00:51.690> start<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> supports<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
on I'll start with the supports that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
on I'll start with the supports that
made<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> list<00:00:53.610> last<00:00:53.850> patch<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.750> let's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
made it to the list last patch so let's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.049 
made it to the list last patch so let's
begin<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:55.379> stating<00:00:55.620> Thresh<00:00:56.129> his<00:00:56.670> head<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
begin by stating Thresh his head is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
begin by stating Thresh his head is
still<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.449> strong<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.870> even<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.710> he<00:00:58.829> didn't

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
still really strong so even if he didn't

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
still really strong so even if he didn't
have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> shield<00:00:59.640> he'd<00:00:59.879> probably<00:01:00.239> still<00:01:00.449> end<00:01:00.750> up

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
have a shield he'd probably still end up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
have a shield he'd probably still end up
on<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> list<00:01:01.469> still<00:01:02.160> he's<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> those

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
on this list still he's one of those

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.280 
on this list still he's one of those
supports<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.600> proc<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> earth<00:01:04.140> and
