good position so backwards up you never

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.220 
good position so backwards up you never
want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> keep<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> put<00:00:23.340> down<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> put<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.300> so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
when you do lunges lunges move have a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
when you do lunges lunges move have a
name<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.680> don't<00:00:28.830> want<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.099> straight<00:00:29.340> up

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
name they don't want to go straight up

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
name they don't want to go straight up
and<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> imagine<00:00:30.869> pressed

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and down so you want to imagine pressed

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900 
and down so you want to imagine pressed
having<00:00:31.710> somebody<00:00:31.890> press<00:00:32.189> back<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> knee

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
having somebody press back on the knee

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.090 
having somebody press back on the knee
and<00:00:33.450> come<00:00:33.690> straight<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:34.890> come

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and come straight back and then come

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
and come straight back and then come
forward<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.180> she's<00:00:36.329> moving<00:00:36.660> hips<00:00:36.840> forward<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
forward so she's moving hips forward and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.850 
forward so she's moving hips forward and
back<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.660> targets<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.320> glutes<00:00:40.590> on

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
back and that really targets a glutes on

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
back and that really targets a glutes on
this<00:00:41.370> side<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> met<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.930> she's<00:00:43.140> just

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this side that I met so she's just

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
this side that I met so she's just
cranking<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> few<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> slay<00:00:44.940> she's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
cranking out a few when you slay she's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
cranking out a few when you slay she's
really<00:00:45.629> coming<00:00:45.809> forward<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.469> coming<00:00:47.100> back

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
really coming forward and coming back

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
really coming forward and coming back
for<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.870> come<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.590> line<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:49.920> their

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
for me can come is in line with their

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
for me can come is in line with their
toe<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.940> course<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.539> ever<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
toe but of course you don't ever want to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
toe but of course you don't ever want to
go<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.980> past<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> especially<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
go up it go past it especially if you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
go up it go past it especially if you
have<00:00:54.510> weight<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.280> loads<00:00:56.579> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have weight and there's more loads with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
have weight and there's more loads with
that<00:00:57.030> stresses<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> name<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that stresses on that name do you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
that stresses on that name do you
driving<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:59.010> coming<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.719> then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
driving back coming down and then

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
driving back coming down and then
driving<00:01:01.109> straight<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.640> really

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
driving straight back which really

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
driving straight back which really
targets<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> glutes<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.809> hamstrings<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> lot

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
targets the glutes and hamstrings a lot

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
targets the glutes and hamstrings a lot
more<00:01:04.710> effectively<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:05.970> straight<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
more effectively when you go straight up

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
more effectively when you go straight up
and<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.960> split<00:01:07.200> squat<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.619> works<00:01:07.799> more

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and down into split squat it works more

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
and down into split squat it works more
that<00:01:08.220> Club<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> switch<00:01:09.180> sides

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that Club we're going to switch sides

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
that Club we're going to switch sides
and<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.840> trillion<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.619> she<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and one trillion how she can do it on

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
and one trillion how she can do it on
the<00:01:11.310> other<00:01:11.400> side

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 

so<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.180> site<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so this site you can actually see that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
so this site you can actually see that
glues<00:01:16.590> activate<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
glues activate so when you do this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
glues activate so when you do this
exercise<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:19.020> should<00:01:19.049> feel<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.590> glutes

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
exercise you should feel your glutes

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.780 
exercise you should feel your glutes
really<00:01:21.030> fire<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> means<00:01:22.470> contract<00:01:22.920> or

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
really fire so that means contract or

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.030 
really fire so that means contract or
squeeze<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> blame<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.830> there

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
squeeze for all you blame is out there

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460 
squeeze for all you blame is out there
but<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:26.970> works<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> glute<00:01:28.080> muscle<00:01:28.440> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but it really works that glute muscle a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
but it really works that glute muscle a
lot<00:01:28.619> more<00:01:28.800> effectively<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.580> about<00:01:29.970> doing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
lot more effectively so it's about doing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.660 
lot more effectively so it's about doing
this<00:01:30.420> exercise<00:01:30.979> efficiently<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> correctly

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
this exercise efficiently and correctly

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.190 
this exercise efficiently and correctly
as<00:01:33.060> opposed<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:34.050> through<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
as opposed to just going through the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
as opposed to just going through the
motions<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.770> she's<00:01:34.979> driving<00:01:35.399> back<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
motions so she's driving back to that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
motions so she's driving back to that
need<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.479> her<00:01:36.750> pressures<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.680> heel<00:01:37.979> here

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
need all her pressures on this heel here

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
need all her pressures on this heel here
she<00:01:38.729> wants<00:01:38.940> her<00:01:39.060> toes<00:01:39.330> up<00:01:39.600> she<00:01:40.080> doesn't<00:01:40.320> want

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
she wants her toes up she doesn't want

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
she wants her toes up she doesn't want
to<00:01:40.470> put<00:01:40.619> any<00:01:40.860> weight<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.550> toes<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.090> my

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to put any weight on these toes so my

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
to put any weight on these toes so my
fingers<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.780> never<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.140> crunched<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
fingers should never get crunched if I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
fingers should never get crunched if I
have<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.399> hand<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:44.970> she's<00:01:45.390> driving<00:01:45.840> them

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
