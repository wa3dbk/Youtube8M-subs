there's no speakers inside it but it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
internal speakers and that actually

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
internal speakers and that actually
works<00:00:29.519> pretty<00:00:29.910> well<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.779> big<00:00:30.929> question<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
works pretty well the big question is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
works pretty well the big question is
how<00:00:31.740> well<00:00:32.189> does<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.850> actually<00:00:33.360> project<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
how well does this actually project it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.880 
how well does this actually project it
has<00:00:34.610> 960<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:35.790> 540<00:00:36.300> resolution<00:00:37.230> that's<00:00:37.350> pretty

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
has 960 by 540 resolution that's pretty

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.959 
has 960 by 540 resolution that's pretty
good

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
good

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
good
it<00:00:39.210> isn't<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.960> bright<00:00:40.260> projector<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> might

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it isn't a bright projector as you might

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
it isn't a bright projector as you might
imagine<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.239> helps<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> dim<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
imagine so it really helps to dim the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
imagine so it really helps to dim the
lights<00:00:43.260> even<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.129> blackened<00:00:44.820> room<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
lights even a blackened room is really

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
lights even a blackened room is really
the<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.550> get

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the way to go with this you can get

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.330 
the way to go with this you can get
pretty<00:00:48.239> big<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.200> obviously<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> smaller<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
pretty big but obviously the smaller you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
pretty big but obviously the smaller you
go<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> brighter<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> picture<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
go the brighter the picture is going to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
go the brighter the picture is going to
be<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> would<00:00:53.280> say<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> range

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
be so I would say more like in the range

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439 
be so I would say more like in the range
of<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.539> twenty<00:00:55.340> twenty<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> thirty<00:00:56.910> inches

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
of about twenty twenty to thirty inches

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.599 
of about twenty twenty to thirty inches
is<00:00:57.660> probably<00:00:58.020> ideal<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is probably ideal for this there are a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.060 
is probably ideal for this there are a
couple<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.359> small<00:01:00.600> drawbacks<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
couple of small drawbacks to the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
couple of small drawbacks to the
projector<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> issues<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.019> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
projector one of the issues is you do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
projector one of the issues is you do
have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.390> hand<00:01:06.689> or

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
have to have this in your hand or

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
have to have this in your hand or
somehow<00:01:07.110> proper<00:01:07.710> dup<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
somehow proper dup it's not so easy to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.840 
somehow proper dup it's not so easy to
get<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.840> perfectly<00:01:10.439> square<00:01:10.950> picture<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
get a perfectly square picture when you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.280 
get a perfectly square picture when you
prop<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.450> also<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.560> iPod<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.760> iPhone

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
prop it up also your iPod or your iPhone

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
prop it up also your iPod or your iPhone
doesn't<00:01:16.290> attach<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.400> securely<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
doesn't attach that securely to the the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.039 
doesn't attach that securely to the the
projector<00:01:19.470> itself<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> nice<00:01:21.390> pop<00:01:21.840> out

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
projector itself it has a nice pop out

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
projector itself it has a nice pop out
dock<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.560> pretty<00:01:22.860> cool<00:01:23.070> its<00:01:23.670> retractable

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
dock that's pretty cool its retractable

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.149 
dock that's pretty cool its retractable
this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.350> small<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.890> carry<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this is very small and you can carry it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.210 
this is very small and you can carry it
around<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.240> device<00:01:28.220> isn't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
around with you but your device isn't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
around with you but your device isn't
that<00:01:29.460> secure<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.479> careful<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that secure so you have to be careful it

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
that secure so you have to be careful it
doesn't<00:01:31.409> pop<00:01:31.799> off<00:01:32.070> aside<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
doesn't pop off aside from that this is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
doesn't pop off aside from that this is
really<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> direction<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.680> pico

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
really the direction that pico

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
really the direction that pico
projectors<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.930> attaches

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
projectors have to go that attaches

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.980 
projectors have to go that attaches
right<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:38.100> iPhone<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.090> has<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> passable

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
right to your iPhone it has a passable

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
right to your iPhone it has a passable
picture<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:41.009> relatively<00:01:41.520> inexpensive<00:01:41.670> at

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
picture it's relatively inexpensive at

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960 
picture it's relatively inexpensive at
$99<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.040> I'd<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> keep<00:01:44.820> your

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
$99 so what I'd say is keep your

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.730 
$99 so what I'd say is keep your
expectations<00:01:45.420> low<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.320> you'll<00:01:46.439> actually<00:01:46.560> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
expectations low and you'll actually be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.819 
expectations low and you'll actually be
pretty<00:01:47.189> impressed<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.600> pop<00:01:48.899> video<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
pretty impressed with the pop video it's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
pretty impressed with the pop video it's
not<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> great<00:01:50.640> projector<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> certainly

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
not a great projector but it certainly

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.889 
not a great projector but it certainly
is<00:01:52.159> worth<00:01:53.159> bringing<00:01:53.430> along<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.600> far

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
is worth bringing along on the go as far

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
is worth bringing along on the go as far
as<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.530> project<00:01:55.649> from<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.280> iPhone

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
as what you can project from your iPhone

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
as what you can project from your iPhone
it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.899> complicated<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.740> can

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it is a little bit complicated you can

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.749 
it is a little bit complicated you can
do<00:01:59.100> videos<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:01.079> images<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
do videos you can also do images and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.060 
do videos you can also do images and
then<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> pop<00:02:03.750> video<00:02:04.170> app<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then there is a pop video app that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
then there is a pop video app that
allows<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> project<00:02:05.640> facebook<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.659> well

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
as webpages you do have to launch that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.110 
as webpages you do have to launch that
app<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.899> order<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.920> aside<00:02:11.790> from<00:02:11.910> some

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
app in order to do that aside from some

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.250 
app in order to do that aside from some
of<00:02:12.209> those<00:02:12.300> drawbacks<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> was<00:02:13.080> talking
