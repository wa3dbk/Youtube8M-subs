00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
right so let's get started I'm going to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.150 
right so let's get started I'm going to
try<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.439> quick<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.039> snappy

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
try to make this quick and snappy

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.439 
try to make this quick and snappy
there's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.670> lot<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.180> colors<00:00:24.359> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
there's a lot of different colors you

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.340 
there's a lot of different colors you
can<00:00:24.510> choose<00:00:24.750> from

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
can choose from

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.589 
can choose from
there<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.250> obviously<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> same<00:00:27.180> models

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
there are obviously all the same models

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
there are obviously all the same models
but<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> prices<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.160> bit<00:00:29.460> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
but the prices do very little bit I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.540 
but the prices do very little bit I
think<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.390> black<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.840> cheapest<00:00:31.260> one

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
think the black one is the cheapest one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.250 
think the black one is the cheapest one
but<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.759> started

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
but let's get started

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.420 
but let's get started

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
comparison I have here I have I have a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.819 
comparison I have here I have I have a
nickel<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.350> dime<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.520> probably

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
nickel and a dime so I would probably

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.700 
nickel and a dime so I would probably
you<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.520> yourself<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.060> guess

you could just see for yourself I guess

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.120 
you could just see for yourself I guess
that's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.189> dime<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.680> yeah<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that's a dime so yeah it's just do the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
that's a dime so yeah it's just do the
whole<00:01:41.189> nickel<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.390> even

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
whole nickel out because you don't even

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.539 
whole nickel out because you don't even
need<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.880> as<00:01:44.880> far<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.329> sound<00:01:45.540> quality<00:01:46.110> I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.210 
feel for how they fit or how they look
like<00:02:42.459> when<00:02:42.640> they're<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.940> my<00:02:43.090> ear<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:45.010> like

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
like when they're in my ear so it's like

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.960 
like when they're in my ear so it's like
that<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.540> does<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.050> your<00:02:47.230> ear<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.970> if

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
you're worried about how I said it was

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.530 
you're worried about how I said it was
like<00:02:50.880> off-center<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:53.110> know<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.910> fits<00:02:55.390> in

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
like off-center you know that it fits in

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.210 
like off-center you know that it fits in
your<00:02:55.660> ear<00:02:55.810> fine<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.350> just<00:02:56.380> they<00:02:56.680> designed<00:02:57.069> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
your ear fine it just they designed it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.570 
your ear fine it just they designed it
like<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.850> goes<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.310> it<00:03:00.310> looks

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
like that so it goes in and it looks

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.800 
like that so it goes in and it looks
okay<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:03.040> far<00:03:03.250> as<00:03:03.310> sound<00:03:03.819> isolation<00:03:04.390> as

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
okay and as far as sound isolation as

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.949 
okay and as far as sound isolation as
long<00:03:05.800> as<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.130> playing<00:03:06.489> your<00:03:06.760> music<00:03:06.940> at<00:03:07.510> a

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
long as you're playing your music at a

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.840 
long as you're playing your music at a
certain<00:03:08.530> volume<00:03:08.800> you<00:03:09.190> know<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> little<00:03:09.640> bit

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
certain volume you know a little bit

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.570 
certain volume you know a little bit
above<00:03:10.269> media<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:11.350> should<00:03:11.650> isolate<00:03:11.950> most<00:03:12.430> of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
above media it should isolate most of

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.930 
above media it should isolate most of
the<00:03:12.640> sound<00:03:12.959> from<00:03:13.959> outside<00:03:14.640> because<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.670> know

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the sound from outside because you know

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.440 
the sound from outside because you know
you'll<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.420> blessing<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.290> music<00:03:17.709> but

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
you'll be blessing it music but

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.030 
you'll be blessing it music but
definitely<00:03:19.450> don't<00:03:19.600> play<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.530> too<00:03:20.829> loud

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
definitely don't play it too loud

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.420 
definitely don't play it too loud
because<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:23.140> know<00:03:23.170> we'll<00:03:23.920> all<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.160> deaf

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
because then you know we'll all be deaf

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.460 
because then you know we'll all be deaf
and<00:03:24.700> stuff<00:03:25.150> when<00:03:25.360> we<00:03:25.420> get<00:03:25.570> older<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.320> that's

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
and stuff when we get older so that's

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.090 
and stuff when we get older so that's
not<00:03:26.620> good

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
not good

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.830
