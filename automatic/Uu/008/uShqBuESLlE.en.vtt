00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
sort of find the shape and very often

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.280 
sort of find the shape and very often
her<00:00:33.890> work<00:00:34.100> has<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.399> very<00:00:34.760> rough<00:00:35.090> look<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:36.079> it

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
the surfaces of his paintings so that he

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.700 
the surfaces of his paintings so that he
will<00:00:49.339> collage<00:00:49.730> on<00:00:50.180> bits<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.839> canvas<00:00:51.530> and

sometimes<00:00:52.190> bills<00:00:52.579> out<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.059> surfaces<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.379> that

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
sometimes bills out the surfaces so that

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.040 
sometimes bills out the surfaces so that
they<00:00:54.680> look<00:00:54.890> like<00:00:55.040> they<00:00:55.250> have<00:00:55.460> relief<00:00:55.879> he<00:00:56.809> makes

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
they look like they have relief he makes

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.069

things<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.920> are<00:00:58.100> very<00:00:58.399> recognizable<00:00:59.329> but

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
things that are very recognizable but

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.290 
things that are very recognizable but
when<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.350> look<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:00.739> them<00:01:00.949> very<00:01:01.609> often<00:01:01.850> he's

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
when you look at them very often he's

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.109 
when you look at them very often he's
repeating<00:01:02.989> shapes<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.769> he's<00:01:04.580> repeating

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
repeating shapes and he's repeating

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.630 
repeating shapes and he's repeating
different<00:01:05.479> kinds<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.899> form<00:01:06.289> you<00:01:06.800> also<00:01:07.250> have<00:01:07.460> to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
different kinds of form you also have to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.630 
different kinds of form you also have to
look<00:01:07.789> at<00:01:08.060> how<00:01:08.539> he<00:01:08.600> creates<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.500> pattern<00:01:10.369> all

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
look at how he creates this pattern all

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.139 
look at how he creates this pattern all
over<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.630> painting<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.320> how<00:01:13.100> your<00:01:13.580> eye<00:01:13.610> goes

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
over the painting and how your eye goes

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.060 
over the painting and how your eye goes
from<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:14.660> shape<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:14.990> another<00:01:15.200> shape<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.950> how

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
from one shape to another shape and how

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.850 
from one shape to another shape and how
he<00:01:16.130> makes<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:17.300> shapes<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.840> different<00:01:18.590> things

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
he makes the shapes of different things

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.100 
he makes the shapes of different things
look<00:01:19.340> similar<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.420> get<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.869> sense

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
look similar so that you get this sense

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.279 
look similar so that you get this sense
of<00:01:21.500> rhythm<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.240> get<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.539> sense<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.960> color

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
of rhythm and you get the sense of color

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.770 
of rhythm and you get the sense of color
and<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.100> sense<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.670> all<00:01:26.179> over

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
and you get the sense of all over

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.260 
and you get the sense of all over
repetition<00:01:28.300> art<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:30.459> extremely<00:01:31.459> difficult<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
repetition art is extremely difficult to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.979 
repetition art is extremely difficult to
do<00:01:32.679> good<00:01:33.679> art<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.580> extremely<00:01:35.390> difficult<00:01:35.539> we

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:35.989 
do good art it's extremely difficult we

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.199 
do good art it's extremely difficult we
never<00:01:36.200> think<00:01:36.470> about<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.220> way<00:01:37.489> because<00:01:37.759> if

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
never think about it that way because if

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.109 
never think about it that way because if
we<00:01:38.360> thought<00:01:38.599> about<00:01:38.890> how<00:01:39.890> difficult<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:40.849> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
we thought about how difficult it is and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.669 
we thought about how difficult it is and
what<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.690> really<00:01:41.869> have<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.229> go<00:01:42.380> through<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
what you really have to go through to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:02:05.919 
what you really have to go through to
become<00:01:42.890> an<00:01:42.979> artist<00:01:43.099> no<00:01:43.550> one<00:01:43.700> would<00:01:43.849> do<00:01:44.000> it

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.199 

to<00:02:06.929> be<00:02:07.109> an<00:02:07.259> artist<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.399> absurd<00:02:08.819> thing

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
to be an artist is a really absurd thing

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
to be an artist is a really absurd thing
to<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.349> put<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.800> rational<00:02:11.430> level

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to do if you put it on a rational level

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
to do if you put it on a rational level
that's<00:02:11.970> why<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.959> only<00:02:13.170> people<00:02:13.410> who<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.709> if

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that's why the only people who do it if

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.850 
that's why the only people who do it if
people<00:02:13.920> who<00:02:14.099> absolutely<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.620> content<00:02:16.620> is
