00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.719
 hello friends today we are going to make a kitchen 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 baked all these ingredients is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.119
 approximately for four people like this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.039
 is that I indicated you and you decide 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.169
 what you want to do if you want to do 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.349
 less then half the amount like that is 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:31.220
 that we started we have a potato a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.950
 tomato a head of garlic 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.149
 2 blood sausages these can be rice or 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.329
 of onion as you want 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.860
 we also have sausages there are those who 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.960
 It is not what I like with 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.640
 organic then we also have some 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.070
 little aunts 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.649
 of pork we have two pieces for each 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.559
 one so you can get an idea 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.220
 here I have bacon I like more with 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.830
 bacon but it is usually done with plots 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.530
 to taste we also have rice here 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.840
 the water I'm going to put two glasses a day 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.190
 because we like a lot but 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.470
 you put the amount that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.300
 also some chickpeas that these 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.550
 chickpeas are usually put 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 of cooked or was after understood for 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.750
 another or just as I have taken a 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.510
 easier boat 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.080
 well a little bit of oregano salt and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.870
 Colorant 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.040
 here we have tomato and potato 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.040
 to peel the potato 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.670
 and 90 we have peladita, so let's go 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 make it as if they were sliced 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 good this 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 besides possibly almost all of you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.320
 you have done it 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.680
 well we have short life now we go 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.680
 to make a few slices too caps 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.460
 and now to tomato the tomato we're going to 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.210
 remove this and what we wash we're going to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.659
 remove this and the same thing we do in 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.659
 slices 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.950
 and that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.950
 we will reserve it 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.510
 we have already cut the normals too 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 because we will make the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750
 blood sausages 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.530
 and we're also going to cut the bacon this 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.850
 that we have here smoked that is going to give 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.520
 a very good taste 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.720
 the flavor we will cut it like this 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.880
 in a pan we are going to put oil 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.790
 more or less that charges as 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.020
 once we have it warm we are going to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.020
 put the ribs 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.030
 let's go here 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.440
 Lets put 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.440
 the romanillas 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.110
 and we continue reserving blood sausages and 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.700
 So we'll have tomato late 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.040
 when time takes away from gaitÃ¡n the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
 potatoes we will add finally the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.709
 Arrocito 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.709
 also ungainly 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.770
 finally we put a little bit of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.770
 power before 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.830
 we see it all a little bit a day 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.880
 Once we have all the sauce, we have 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.250
 passed to a source usually is usually 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.600
 put in a clay pot but I do not 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.370
 I have such a big clay pot 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.820
 so I'm going to do it in this source 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.820
 what more or less 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.790
 we will have it until it dries 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.450
 completely with the oven previously 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.820
 heated and what we have for about 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.590
 35-40 minutes and before serving it 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.590
 let's rest another 5
