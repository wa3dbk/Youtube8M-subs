00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
supposed to decorate the nail and make

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
supposed to decorate the nail and make

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
on there and keep it on but I wanted to

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.719 
on there and keep it on but I wanted to
use<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.189> holding<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
use it a different way so I'm holding it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.929 
use it a different way so I'm holding it
down<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> design<00:01:34.939> however

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
down and then just make a design however

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.640 
down and then just make a design however
you<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.659> lines<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.380> lay

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you want to make your lines just lay

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.010 
you want to make your lines just lay
them<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:45.020> cutting

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
them down like that and then I'm cutting

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.440 
them down like that and then I'm cutting
it<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.800 

so<00:01:54.140> there's<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:55.009> those<00:01:55.280> stripes<00:01:55.700> put<00:01:56.570> down

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so there's all those stripes put down

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.529 
so there's all those stripes put down
and<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.289> wanted<00:01:58.039> little<00:01:58.640> pieces<00:01:58.969> kind<00:01:59.450> of

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
and I wanted little pieces kind of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.020 
and I wanted little pieces kind of
poking<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.110> hanging<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:01.520> easier<00:02:01.880> to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
poking up hanging on so it's easier to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.719 
poking up hanging on so it's easier to
pull<00:02:02.270> off<00:02:02.479> once<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.259> get<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.159> last<00:02:04.369> step

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
pull off once you get to the last step

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.999 
pull off once you get to the last step
and<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:05.570> i'm<00:02:05.750> going<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:05.990> take<00:02:06.289> trying<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
and now i'm going to take trying to

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.559 
and now i'm going to take trying to
glazes<00:02:07.520> emerald<00:02:08.239> sparkle<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.640> simply<00:02:10.640> paint

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
glazes emerald sparkle and simply paint

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:24.200 
glazes emerald sparkle and simply paint
over<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:14.390> cover<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.050> entire<00:02:15.170> thing

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.480 

and<00:02:24.600> after<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.470> you're<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.160> want<00:02:26.370> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
and after that you're going to want to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.010 
and after that you're going to want to
