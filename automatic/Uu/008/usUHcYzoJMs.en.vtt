00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I've been putting off a small project of

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.220 
I've been putting off a small project of
mine<00:00:01.920> for<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.190> while<00:00:02.370> now<00:00:02.909> back<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.419> 2012<00:00:03.959> I

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
mine for a while now back in 2012 I

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.930 
mine for a while now back in 2012 I
juggled<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> leg<00:00:04.950> district<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.700> made<00:00:05.819> it

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
juggled in the leg district and made it

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.240 
juggled in the leg district and made it
into<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.420> however<00:00:07.259> back<00:00:07.620> then<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.980> wasn't

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
into a video however back then I wasn't

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
into a video however back then I wasn't
that<00:00:08.490> good<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:08.910> video<00:00:09.179> quality<00:00:09.389> settings<00:00:09.929> or

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
that good with video quality settings or

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.540 
that good with video quality settings or
anything<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.769> rendered<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.429> all

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
anything like that and rendered it all

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700 
anything like that and rendered it all
in<00:00:11.730> 50<00:00:12.120> i<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:13.019> was<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> deliberate<00:00:13.650> decision

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
in 50 i this was a deliberate decision

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
in 50 i this was a deliberate decision
at<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> time<00:00:14.250> since<00:00:14.700> most<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
at the time since most of it was

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.320 
at the time since most of it was
recorded<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.109> 50<00:00:16.410> i<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> few<00:00:17.430> bits<00:00:17.580> were<00:00:17.760> 50p

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
recorded in 50 i but a few bits were 50p

recorded in 50 i but a few bits were 50p
in<00:00:19.050> short<00:00:19.380> 50<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.130> 50<00:00:20.520> frames<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.850> second<00:00:21.210> but

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
in short 50 i is 50 frames a second but

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
in short 50 i is 50 frames a second but
it<00:00:21.480> only<00:00:21.570> records<00:00:22.050> half<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> each<00:00:22.650> frame<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it only records half of each frame to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650 
it only records half of each frame to
try<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.340> get<00:00:23.430> balance<00:00:23.760> between<00:00:23.880> quality<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
try and get balance between quality and

50p<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> real<00:00:26.939> deal<00:00:27.210> where<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> stores<00:00:27.840> 50

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

pictures a second toward the end of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.730 
pictures a second toward the end of the
holiday<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> switched<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.320> setting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
holiday I switched it to this setting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.900 
holiday I switched it to this setting
thinking<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.460> make<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:32.730> look

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
thinking that it would make things look

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.170 
thinking that it would make things look
better<00:00:33.120> however<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.680> doesn't<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.309> Sony<00:00:36.000> Vegas

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
better however it doesn't in Sony Vegas

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
better however it doesn't in Sony Vegas
you<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.110> options<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> render<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.430> 50

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you have two options if you render in 50

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
you have two options if you render in 50
I<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.239> footage<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.079> 50<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> looks<00:00:40.860> great

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I the footage that's in 50 I looks great

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
I the footage that's in 50 I looks great
it's<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.180> smooth<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.570> 50<00:00:42.840> FPS<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.379> looks<00:00:43.559> good

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's as smooth as 50 FPS and looks good

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's as smooth as 50 FPS and looks good
when<00:00:43.920> played<00:00:44.129> back<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.000> 50p<00:00:45.510> footage<00:00:45.930> however

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
when played back the 50p footage however

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
when played back the 50p footage however
suffers<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:46.920> ghosting<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.789> see

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
suffers from ghosting where you can see

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.490 
suffers from ghosting where you can see
multiple<00:00:48.329> overlapping<00:00:48.809> images<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
multiple overlapping images when you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
multiple overlapping images when you
pause<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.190> why<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.760> render<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.149> 50<00:00:51.449> P<00:00:51.600> then

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
pause it so why not render in 50 P then

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
pause it so why not render in 50 P then
because<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> 50<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> footage<00:00:53.520> gets

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because then all the 50 I footage gets

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
because then all the 50 I footage gets
all<00:00:53.879> ghosty<00:00:54.329> you'd<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> wouldn't<00:00:55.350> but

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
all ghosty you'd think it wouldn't but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
all ghosty you'd think it wouldn't but
clearly<00:00:55.770> there's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.430> trickery<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
clearly there's a lot more trickery that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
clearly there's a lot more trickery that

right<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.310> day<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:08.909> come<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> wasn't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
right that day has come but it wasn't

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.050 
right that day has come but it wasn't
easy<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.340> still<00:01:11.490> easier<00:01:11.729> than<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.939> had

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
easy but it was still easier than I had

easy but it was still easier than I had
expected<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> firstly<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.979> audio<00:01:14.250> from

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the video was messed up this was because

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
the video was messed up this was because
the<00:01:16.409> camera<00:01:16.770> record<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> 5.1<00:01:17.820> surround<00:01:18.000> but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the camera record in 5.1 surround but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
the camera record in 5.1 surround but
Vegas<00:01:18.780> doesn't<00:01:19.080> automatically<00:01:19.680> pick<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.950> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
Vegas doesn't automatically pick it up

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
Vegas doesn't automatically pick it up
and<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.490> reason<00:01:20.909> crams<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and for some reason crams most of the

and for some reason crams most of the
sound<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> right<00:01:22.320> speaker<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.040> didn't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
sound into the right speaker I didn't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.950 
sound into the right speaker I didn't
have<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> original<00:01:24.119> footage<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> intro

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
have the original footage of the intro

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
have the original footage of the intro
so<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> could<00:01:25.439> only<00:01:25.560> centralized<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so I could only centralized it but I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.249 
so I could only centralized it but I
replaced<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> faulty<00:01:27.600> end<00:01:27.750> audio<00:01:27.930> with

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
replaced the faulty end audio with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
replaced the faulty end audio with
proper<00:01:28.560> 5.1<00:01:29.250> sound<00:01:29.520> correctly<00:01:30.240> converted

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
proper 5.1 sound correctly converted

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
proper 5.1 sound correctly converted
into<00:01:30.840> stereo<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:32.100> went<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
into stereo I then went through the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.069 
into stereo I then went through the
video<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:32.880> selected<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> parts<00:01:33.689> containing

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
video and selected the parts containing

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
video and selected the parts containing
the<00:01:34.170> blurry<00:01:34.530> 50<00:01:35.040> P<00:01:35.189> footage<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.909> said<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the blurry 50 P footage I said it's a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
the blurry 50 P footage I said it's a
50%<00:01:36.900> transparency<00:01:37.799> allowing<00:01:38.369> me<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> slide

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
50% transparency allowing me to slide

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
50% transparency allowing me to slide
the<00:01:38.939> original<00:01:39.360> footage<00:01:39.540> underneath<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the original footage underneath and to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
the original footage underneath and to
that<00:01:40.470> lined<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.799> perfectly<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.850> could<00:01:42.000> do

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
that lined up perfectly then I could do

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
that lined up perfectly then I could do
away<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> original<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> bit

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
away with the original this was the bit

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.289 
away with the original this was the bit
that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> thought<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.119> more

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that I thought was going to be more

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
that I thought was going to be more
difficult<00:01:45.810> since<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.530> over<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.009> hour<00:01:47.220> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
difficult since I had over an hour of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
difficult since I had over an hour of
juggling<00:01:47.820> footage<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.299> sift<00:01:48.540> through<00:01:48.600> for

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
juggling footage to sift through for

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
juggling footage to sift through for
that<00:01:49.049> day<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.070> looked<00:01:50.369> similar

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that day and it all looked similar

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.819 
that day and it all looked similar
luckily<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> had<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> line<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
luckily all I had to do was to line the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
luckily all I had to do was to line the
clouds<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.310> sky<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:53.970> gave<00:01:54.180> me<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
clouds in the sky up which gave me a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
clouds in the sky up which gave me a
rough<00:01:54.540> idea<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> where<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> footage<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
rough idea of where the footage was and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
rough idea of where the footage was and
then<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.280> slowly<00:01:56.460> adjusted<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.060> until<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
then I slowly adjusted it until the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.389 
then I slowly adjusted it until the
balls<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:57.990> hands<00:01:58.229> matched<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
balls and my hands matched up as well I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.039 
balls and my hands matched up as well I
then<00:01:59.820> added<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> color<00:02:00.420> correction<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
then added the color correction that I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
then added the color correction that I
had<00:02:01.259> included<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> original<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.640> fact<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
had included in the original in fact I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.880 
had included in the original in fact I
improved<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.990> since<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> original<00:02:04.770> had

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
improved on it since the original had

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770 
improved on it since the original had
washed<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.340> colors<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.939> managed<00:02:06.509> better

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
washed out colors I managed better

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
washed out colors I managed better
results<00:02:07.259> by<00:02:07.380> upping<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> contrast<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.369> not

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
results by upping the contrast and not

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
results by upping the contrast and not
the<00:02:08.610> color<00:02:08.849> correction<00:02:09.179> instead<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:10.319> done

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the color correction instead all done

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
the color correction instead all done
but<00:02:11.220> there's<00:02:11.400> another<00:02:11.610> problem

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
but there's another problem
