00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.300
 and I have talent here and these bean 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.649
 nothing else 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.270
 what am I doing here? 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.070
 heating what they can do in the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.439
 microwave where you want no 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.439
 It matters also that it is hot 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.810
 the bean caldito william 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.170
 with a delicious green chile like that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.970
 and that chalice take exquisite things 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.740
 that they are going to put in their life 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 good to see then it's ready 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.049
 there is more green because here 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.580
 we pay to pay our prisoners he 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.380
 therefore he needs 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.380
 nothing more and pepper 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 same way I can put you to this is 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.380

 the chilitos see my chilitos 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.460
 this success that we did the only thing that happened 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.200
 was to let it boil in water nothing else 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.660
 when time about ten minutes if you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.750
 they put piloncillo is water or to its remove 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.360
 it can be a very good tip so you know 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.250
 richer is not so spicy what 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.060
 they call having a much richer chile 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.060
 come from now 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.160

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.910
