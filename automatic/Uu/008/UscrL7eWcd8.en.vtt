it<00:01:10.990> hooked<00:01:11.080> up<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.560> plumbing<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.659> pretty

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
it hooked up the plumbing is on pretty

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.120 
it hooked up the plumbing is on pretty
simple<00:01:14.080> disappoint<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.800> didn't<00:01:14.980> come<00:01:15.100> with

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130

simple disappoint it didn't come with
new<00:01:15.370> hoses<00:01:15.610> but<00:01:16.120> I<00:01:16.180> guess<00:01:16.390> that's<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.810> an<00:01:17.320> option

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
new hoses but I guess that's a an option

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.560 
new hoses but I guess that's a an option
I<00:01:17.770> guess<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.640> drain<00:01:18.850> hose<00:01:19.000> hooked<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:19.360> into

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
of pushes the clothes up and around so I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.850 
of pushes the clothes up and around so I
have<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.549> try<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:39.880> guess<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.210> out<00:01:40.330> works

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
have to try it I guess the out works

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.140 
have to try it I guess the out works
okay<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.100> kind<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.400> medium<00:01:42.729> load<00:01:42.909> for

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
some reason we'll see how well it's

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
because there's no sound used to get a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.040 
because there's no sound used to get a
little<00:02:04.500> regular<00:02:04.860> wash<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.310> goes<00:02:05.460> around

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the motor going back and forth cycling

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.660

I did a still deliver wash it filled and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.700 
I did a still deliver wash it filled and
then<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.540> rinsing<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.260> didn't<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.560> what<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
then it was rinsing I didn't know what I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.730 
then it was rinsing I didn't know what I
was<00:02:28.800> doing<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.570> stopped<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.810> open<00:02:31.110> lid<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
was doing so I stopped it open lid and I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.340 
was doing so I stopped it open lid and I
changed<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.220> cycle<00:02:32.760> from<00:02:33.030> heavy<00:02:33.360> intense<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
changed the cycle from heavy intense to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.380 
changed the cycle from heavy intense to
medium<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.520> that's<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.820> restarting<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
medium but that's like restarting the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.820 
medium but that's like restarting the
whole<00:02:36.540> thing<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.170> had<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.380> start<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.620> whole

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
whole thing so I had to start the whole

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.950 
whole thing so I had to start the whole
watch<00:02:38.040> over<00:02:38.280> him<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.850> now<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.420> lot<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
watch over him so now it's a lot of a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.850 
watch over him so now it's a lot of a
spin<00:02:40.200> motors<00:02:40.530> punch

officials of this bar inside expensive
but<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.890> suppose<00:03:43.640> would<00:03:43.760> be<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.879> all<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
but I suppose would be the all the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.910 
but I suppose would be the all the
difference<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:44.750> makes<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.260> so

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
difference it makes is that so

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.250 
difference it makes is that so
