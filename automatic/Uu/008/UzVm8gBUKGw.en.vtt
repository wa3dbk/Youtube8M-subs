be prone to ink spot disease and but
most<00:00:52.719> of<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.049> newer<00:00:53.289> varieties<00:00:54.010> are

you'll<00:02:18.969> see<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.359> names<00:02:19.659> if<00:02:20.019> we<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.409> what<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
you'll see the names if we know what the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.550 
you'll see the names if we know what the
names<00:02:21.010> are<00:02:21.370> listed<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.599> front<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> plant

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
names are listed in front of the plant

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.009 
names are listed in front of the plant
so<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.549> want<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.849> cover<00:02:25.060> using<00:02:25.659> them<00:02:25.840> in

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
so just want to cover using them in

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.270 
so just want to cover using them in
design<00:02:26.819> they<00:02:27.819> are<00:02:27.849> drought<00:02:28.450> tolerant<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.319> but

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
design they are drought tolerant and but

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.479 
design they are drought tolerant and but
also<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.939> take<00:02:31.180> some<00:02:31.659> moisture<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.489> probably

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
also can take some moisture and probably

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.209 
also can take some moisture and probably
look<00:02:33.639> a<00:02:33.760> little<00:02:33.939> better<00:02:34.239> with<00:02:34.510> some<00:02:34.750> regular

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
look a little better with some regular

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.470 
look a little better with some regular
moisture<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.950> think<00:02:39.700> they're<00:02:39.909> really<00:02:40.269> good

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
moisture and I think they're really good

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.470 
moisture and I think they're really good
companion<00:02:41.200> plant<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.739> lot<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.249> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
companion plant with a lot of the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530 
companion plant with a lot of the
Australian<00:02:44.010> California<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.310> South<00:02:45.819> African

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
Australian California and South African

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.959 
Australian California and South African
type<00:02:47.139> plants<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.889> you<00:02:48.129> hear<00:02:48.370> about<00:02:48.400> so

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
type plants that you hear about so

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.069 
type plants that you hear about so
salvias<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:51.180> some<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.419> others<00:02:52.689> that<00:02:52.719> will

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
salvias and some of the others that will

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.270 
salvias and some of the others that will
will<00:02:53.439> follow<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.010> here<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.590> guess<00:02:57.099> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
will follow up with here but I guess the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.459 
will follow up with here but I guess the
biggest<00:02:57.489> limitation<00:02:58.359> unfortunately<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.439> that

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
biggest limitation unfortunately is that

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.059 
biggest limitation unfortunately is that
they're<00:02:59.859> not<00:03:00.010> very<00:03:00.310> cold<00:03:00.760> hardy<00:03:01.709> most<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.949> the

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
they're not very cold hardy most of the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.339 
they're not very cold hardy most of the
varieties<00:03:03.699> are<00:03:03.939> cold<00:03:04.239> hardy<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.139> the

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
varieties are cold hardy to the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.689 
varieties are cold hardy to the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
depending on the variety some you'll see

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290

hundreds Fahrenheit and I've got a

five years and probably 80% of his are
still<00:03:35.439> living<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.069> doing<00:03:36.370> all<00:03:36.549> right

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
still living and doing all right

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.589 
still living and doing all right
I've<00:03:37.419> grown<00:03:37.720> them<00:03:38.019> myself<00:03:38.259> and<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:40.060> had<00:03:40.299> great

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
I've grown them myself and not had great

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.080 
I've grown them myself and not had great
luck<00:03:40.900> with<00:03:40.930> them<00:03:41.379> so<00:03:41.769> we're<00:03:42.430> right<00:03:42.729> on<00:03:42.759> the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
luck with them so we're right on the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.210 
luck with them so we're right on the
cusp<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.720> where<00:03:43.959> these<00:03:44.199> are<00:03:44.409> comfortable<00:03:45.069> in

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
cusp of where these are comfortable in

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
terms of the hardiness range and I would

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.619 
terms of the hardiness range and I would
say<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.459> literature<00:03:49.000> out<00:03:49.180> there<00:03:49.209> that

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
say that the literature out there that

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.839 
say that the literature out there that
says<00:03:49.930> they're<00:03:50.169> Hardy<00:03:50.560> down<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.189> mid<00:03:51.400> 20s

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
says they're Hardy down to the mid 20s

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.670 
says they're Hardy down to the mid 20s
is<00:03:52.090> pretty<00:03:52.389> accurate

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
is pretty accurate

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.879 
is pretty accurate

we have heavier clay soil and his tend

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.129 
we have heavier clay soil and his tend
to<00:03:57.009> do<00:03:57.159> fine<00:03:57.430> with<00:03:57.699> that<00:03:57.909> I<00:03:58.180> would<00:03:58.719> just<00:03:58.930> say

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
to do fine with that I would just say

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.319 
to do fine with that I would just say
that<00:03:59.409> better<00:03:59.739> drainage<00:04:00.159> would<00:04:00.639> probably<00:04:01.180> be

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
that better drainage would probably be

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.069 
that better drainage would probably be
preferred<00:04:01.870> for<00:04:02.620> these<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:04.540> where<00:04:04.719> I've<00:04:04.870> seen

preferred for these but where I've seen
them<00:04:05.229> do<00:04:05.409> their<00:04:05.590> best<00:04:05.889> is<00:04:06.459> in<00:04:06.729> Santa<00:04:07.269> Barbara

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
them do their best is in Santa Barbara

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.199

to 24 inches tall and wide and you're
really<00:04:31.539> gonna<00:04:31.690> need<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.110> look<00:04:32.289> at<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
really gonna need to look at the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.050 
really gonna need to look at the
different<00:04:32.979> varieties<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.610> what<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
different varieties and what the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.570 
different varieties and what the
literature<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:35.440> them<00:04:35.860> by<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.130> grower

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
literature is on them by the grower

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.779 
literature is on them by the grower
before<00:04:37.479> you<00:04:37.630> decide<00:04:38.050> what<00:04:38.520> varieties<00:04:39.520> work

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
before you decide what varieties work

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.490 
before you decide what varieties work
for<00:04:40.090> what<00:04:40.210> you're<00:04:40.360> thinking<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.960> do<00:04:41.110> with<00:04:41.289> them

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
for what you're thinking to do with them

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.219 
for what you're thinking to do with them
so<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:42.130> like<00:04:42.430> using<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> taller<00:04:43.270> varieties<00:04:43.599> as

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
so I like using the taller varieties as

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.960 
so I like using the taller varieties as
background<00:04:44.500> planting<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.610> then<00:04:45.669> put

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
background planting and then put

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.510 
background planting and then put
something<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.539> front<00:04:46.569> of<00:04:46.930> them<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.979> planting

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
something in front of them this planting

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.170 
something in front of them this planting
you<00:04:48.699> see<00:04:48.910> here<00:04:49.270> at<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.569> at<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.199> hotel<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:52.150> know

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
you see here at a at a hotel you know

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.990 
you see here at a at a hotel you know
for<00:04:52.599> me<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.470> could<00:04:53.740> use<00:04:53.979> some<00:04:54.280> extra<00:04:54.669> depth

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
for me it could use some extra depth

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.089 
for me it could use some extra depth
just<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.569> terms<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:56.020> plant<00:04:56.259> composition

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
just in terms of plant composition

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.740 
just in terms of plant composition
they've<00:04:57.340> just<00:04:57.520> thrown<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.120> whole<00:04:58.270> bunch<00:04:58.539> of

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
they've just thrown in a whole bunch of

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.570 
they've just thrown in a whole bunch of
these<00:04:58.900> but<00:04:59.199> I'd<00:04:59.380> like<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.710> see<00:04:59.949> that<00:05:00.130> yellow

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
these but I'd like to see that yellow

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.460 
these but I'd like to see that yellow
color<00:05:00.819> with<00:05:01.150> something<00:05:01.569> more<00:05:01.750> interesting<00:05:02.349> in

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
color with something more interesting in

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.189 
color with something more interesting in
front<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.889> it<00:05:03.009> to<00:05:03.190> set<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> off<00:05:03.729> in<00:05:04.569> a<00:05:04.990> more

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
front of it to set it off in a more

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.370 
front of it to set it off in a more
interesting<00:05:05.530> way<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:07.030> that's<00:05:07.960> what<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.289> can

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
interesting way so that's what I can

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.620 
interesting way so that's what I can
tell<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.919> about<00:05:09.190> kangaroo<00:05:09.940> paw<00:05:10.240> they<00:05:10.479> are

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
tell you about kangaroo paw they are

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.990 
tell you about kangaroo paw they are
deer<00:05:11.020> resistant<00:05:11.680> they're<00:05:11.949> drought<00:05:12.280> resistant

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
deer resistant they're drought resistant

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.540 
deer resistant they're drought resistant
I<00:05:13.360> talked<00:05:13.960> about<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.500> hardiness<00:05:15.069> the

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
I talked about the hardiness the

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.490 
I talked about the hardiness the
maintenance<00:05:16.000> on<00:05:16.270> these<00:05:16.449> is<00:05:16.690> very<00:05:16.780> simple

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
maintenance on these is very simple

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.309 
maintenance on these is very simple
essentially<00:05:18.130> those<00:05:18.370> flower<00:05:18.759> stems<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.750> cut

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
essentially those flower stems you cut

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.350 
essentially those flower stems you cut
them<00:05:20.560> down<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.280> base<00:05:21.490> as<00:05:21.789> low<00:05:22.030> as<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.330> can

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
them down to the base as low as you can

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.719 
them down to the base as low as you can
when<00:05:22.930> they're<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.259> done<00:05:23.289> blooming<00:05:23.860> they'll

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
when they're all done blooming they'll

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.210 
when they're all done blooming they'll
just<00:05:25.060> start<00:05:25.360> looking<00:05:25.780> kind<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.319> faded<00:05:26.979> brown

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
just start looking kind of faded brown

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.790 
just start looking kind of faded brown
the<00:05:27.699> color<00:05:28.000> will<00:05:28.270> go<00:05:28.449> on<00:05:28.659> them<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.169> when<00:05:29.650> they

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the color will go on them and when they

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.770 
the color will go on them and when they
get<00:05:29.949> to<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.250> point<00:05:30.310> that's<00:05:30.909> when<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.330> cut

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
get to that point that's when you cut

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.249 
get to that point that's when you cut
them<00:05:31.990> down<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.650> base<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.780> there<00:05:34.780> are<00:05:34.960> some

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
them down to the base and there are some

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.279 
them down to the base and there are some
varieties<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:35.889> if<00:05:36.219> you<00:05:36.370> cut<00:05:36.639> them<00:05:36.880> above<00:05:37.360> the

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
varieties that if you cut them above the

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.620 
varieties that if you cut them above the
lowest<00:05:38.530> bud<00:05:39.039> node<00:05:39.400> they<00:05:39.729> will<00:05:39.909> branch<00:05:40.300> and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
lowest bud node they will branch and

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.589 
lowest bud node they will branch and
rebloom<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:42.009> if<00:05:42.610> you're<00:05:42.789> looking<00:05:43.120> at<00:05:43.270> certain

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
rebloom so if you're looking at certain

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.839 
rebloom so if you're looking at certain
varieties<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.349> look<00:05:44.560> into<00:05:44.979> that<00:05:45.159> I<00:05:45.370> don't<00:05:45.639> know

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
varieties to look into that I don't know

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.879 
varieties to look into that I don't know
what<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.210> specifics<00:05:46.840> are<00:05:47.020> on<00:05:47.229> all<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.680> those

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
what the specifics are on all of those

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.779 
what the specifics are on all of those
and<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.930> think<00:05:50.620> that's<00:05:50.830> what<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:51.070> can<00:05:51.370> tell<00:05:51.580> you
