00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:09.969
 if the match 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.429
 love to scale third consecutive defeat to immortalize 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.879
 probably shows the Valiani bench 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 lycos for the match from straw bench why 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.590
 a team so after three defeats loot high school political science that 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.880
 show one does not shine beyond some shocks 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.160
 it doesn't shine as I would like players who have 4 thinkable hey 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.910
 that our team lost to the game 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 Sunday derives from one way 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.570
 I don't say shameful but almost ashamed 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 where did he try to play last sassuolo game 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.480
 I am thinking only of the first in the standings today, doing the figure already with the last one 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000
 in the front rankings 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.940
 to those of our fans who are all year or so, we are committed to using code to follow 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 I'm sorry but 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.060
 a decision after new takes because i wanted i read my final kids 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 so decently championship was not 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.060
 had a confrontation in the locker room with 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.690
 lisbon - 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.590
 decision gained overtaking cc 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.030
 but I guess what is a 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.310
 lince thoughts a choice of this kind 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 no it is not the limit I told them that I wanted to finish the season decently 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.890
 then later 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 made a comparison like b &amp; b tudor 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.480
 photo psp 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.620
 if there is still the possibility of one 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.410
 with some chocolate covered with this trainer, yes I was like this 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.990
 sorry it's not the sword anymore 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 something is broken that I regret the world 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.250
 but this is not my world 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.730
 while talking about the section it will be an internal king solution 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 the bench real cool amistad farinacei I think 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.509
 empanadas central perspective 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.230

 but no no no no no 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.310
 there are several coaches who want, just choose my world 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.900
 choose a player 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.150
 that has my own ideas that you plan to walk the young because the monster a 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
 2008 2009 I'm thrown on the site 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.150
