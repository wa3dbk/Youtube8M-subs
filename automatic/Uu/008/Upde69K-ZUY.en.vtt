00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 where my race I am the German of the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.120
 double rhyme I come from the low south 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 representing your good street hip hop 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.199
 and empty emerson homies in all of Mexico 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 we are here we are representing 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.240
 so in this order I started more or 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 less as in the 14 years this was a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.860
 quick and I saw a trace and rapping and the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.780
 fucking and I like the power that has 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.090
 the person before the micro is not a power 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.710
 speak the word because we combine it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.890
 the attention as with a word you can 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 move shit of people and that was the pe 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.120
 I think every person needs to look 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 a main and in raps of fear was my 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 passion and that's what moves me and that 's why 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 that right now I'm sitting here for a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 more time is very good that they are 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.570
 opening the doors that's very cool 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 but for example some artists who 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 they have presented are only nothing more 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 for the prick pose pure faramalla and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 I think that for rap to be accepted 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 well it has to be seen with a way of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 not art and expression because each as 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 each role is like a painting a work of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 art or can not say stop and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.519
 do so many and when they are not respected 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.530
 dimensions because this is a zero and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.570
 Many people do not take it, but this 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 boy who will leave the doors and yesterday 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.720
 at the moment when someone was going to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.300
 he deserves it and he deserves a place 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 way that is there that to egg the race 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.590
 says that good real being and he deserves it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 I fit that is concerned to further boost your 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.800
 artists that have more weight 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.020
 more for more carnal program 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.850
 same movement not many people have 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.760
 thus shaped by favors 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.370
 artists have that charlotte image 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.100
 that it takes to kill and when in fact neither 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.050
 it's true they do not remain incarnate but 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.750
 seriously the rap came out of the street and from 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.910
 there comes the idea and it is then never goes 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.380
 to lose that essence, but it's like 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.780
 I have is art and people do not have to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.820
 accept no no no no act is done 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.490
 vandalism the race that is left 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.470
 influence because it is another but it is not 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.010
 this described is the double rhyme 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.500
 classic rap 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.610
 This district can be found in the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.310
 crew stores 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.590
 will be in vision this is inscribed 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.900
 we recorded it this year of 2012 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 at the end of December we did it is a 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.200
 disc that is called classic rap so 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.240
 they are pure pure nineties 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.250
 flows ponchados and they are moving well 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590
 right now and it's hours we're here 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 because we are seeing the material that in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.270
 the senate is a collective of artists 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 Nationals, most of all, we are carnal 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
 not those of us who are there, we enter because 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.510
 we hold out a hand we help each other 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.209
 each other but we are a collective that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.380
 makes rap rock hardcore this rap of the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.380
 street and 100% Mexican is not also like 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.900
 person I am erc and raül German ramírez 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 German in my last name and they have always 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.670
 said if from the morrillo this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.290
 I consider a calm person smoking 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.390
 as it is not because the race sees that one 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.150
 is smoking or is I start smoking in 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.820
 my house write I'm going to watch TV no no 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.770
 I'm violating a love revoked not like the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.670
 rational that I pass it because I was 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.670
 good marijuana 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.260
 of the most chic with her cousin 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.170
 past was a day that decided to touch the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.210
 peace baja california south and I went about 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.740
 homies there they invited me this woman let's go 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.380
 to give us a tank I'm going here around the corner 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.540
 and we went we put a panel and all the 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.120
 hair but when we were there inside 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.180
 this one arrived the chota and already I already 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.880
 they were announcing through the microphone and I 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.860
 They got into the truck and they did not believe me 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.120
 that I say amparo and I'm going to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.310
 introduce myself and they turned around 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.650
 we went through the event they heard my 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.100
 name and simone even broke through and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 now let me pass marijuana now 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.420
 it is already here, that is, but most of all, web 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.940
 the most chingón this dog is to see the 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.650
 people like how you sing a song of yours like 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.020
 raise the carnal hand because that does not have 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.360
 price if it is the pleasure that is inside 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.100
 see how a fucking invention of yours 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.440
 because they are things of a not art that 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.720
 it comes clearly as another race takes it 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.340
 for them and he sings those takes not 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.190
 has a carnal price is the best 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.320
 can 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.060
 Nerves of friends and anyone you 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.820
 can say that he will feel nervous but 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.650
 I have already stepped on being there good I 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.450
 we stay on this planet those that we 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.550
 we go on stage we want to demonstrate 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.170
 the fart like when you say a rhyme 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.410

 government does not want to do well always 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.660
 that's why the feeling this one could not take 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.240
 around 10 years ago they started now 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.210
