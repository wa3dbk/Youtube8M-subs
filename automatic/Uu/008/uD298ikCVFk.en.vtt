00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
carrying this like I said everyday for

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.450 
carrying this like I said everyday for
about<00:02:39.120> five<00:02:39.570> months<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.860> not<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.160> bad<00:02:41.340> as

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
about five months so it's not as bad as

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.590 
about five months so it's not as bad as
it<00:02:41.580> could<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:42.030> although<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.730> know<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.090> does

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
it could be although you know it does

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.990 
it could be although you know it does
kind<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.900> look<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:48.090> well-loved

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000

that's<00:02:51.000> probably<00:02:51.330> my<00:02:51.480> only<00:02:51.630> complaint<00:02:51.959> about

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
that's probably my only complaint about

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.720 
that's probably my only complaint about
it<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> coating<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.100> understand<00:02:53.580> why

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it is the coating but I understand why

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.949 
it is the coating but I understand why
it's<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.300> they're<00:02:54.450> worried<00:02:54.690> about<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
it's on there they're worried about the

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:55.850 
it's on there they're worried about the
knife<00:02:55.140> rusting

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
knife rusting

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.770 
knife rusting
but<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.520> you're<00:02:56.670> using<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.090> everyday<00:02:57.330> that's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
but if you're using it everyday that's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.570 
but if you're using it everyday that's
going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> keep<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> rest<00:02:58.440> off<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.010> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
going to keep the rest off of it and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.650 
going to keep the rest off of it and
also<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.330> keep<00:03:00.510> your<00:03:00.660> knife<00:03:01.400> oiled<00:03:02.660> now

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.930 
sorta sorta a kind of sharp but not
really<00:04:18.959> sharp<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:20.100> took<00:04:20.340> me<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.519> while<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.820> get

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
really sharp it took me a while to get

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.110 
really sharp it took me a while to get
it<00:04:21.030> sharpened<00:04:21.419> up<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:22.169> blame<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.130> less<00:04:23.700> on<00:04:23.940> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it sharpened up I blame that less on the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.780 
it sharpened up I blame that less on the
steel<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.810> more<00:04:25.080> of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
steel and more of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.590 
steel and more of
my<00:04:26.090> lack<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.390> skill<00:04:26.870> for<00:04:27.350> using<00:04:27.950> an<00:04:28.070> actual

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.000 
honing stone instead of a knife
sharpening<00:04:31.640> system<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.320> had<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> little<00:04:33.920> bit

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
sharpening system so I had a little bit

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.620 
sharpening system so I had a little bit
of<00:04:34.070> learning<00:04:34.190> curve<00:04:34.400> that's<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:35.090> me<00:04:35.360> that's

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
of learning curve that's on me that's

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.840 
of learning curve that's on me that's
not<00:04:35.810> necessarily<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.410> knife<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:37.370> right<00:04:37.670> now

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
not necessarily a knife but right now

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.340 
not necessarily a knife but right now
that's<00:04:38.060> got<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> pretty<00:04:38.510> good<00:04:38.630> edge<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:39.050> it'll

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
that's got a pretty good edge on it'll

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.620 
that's got a pretty good edge on it'll
push<00:04:39.500> cut<00:04:39.770> paper<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.850> does<00:04:41.240> pretty<00:04:41.540> much

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
push cut paper it does pretty much

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.740 
push cut paper it does pretty much
anything<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.080> asked<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:43.330> I've<00:04:44.330> used<00:04:44.630> the

anything I asked of it I've used the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.560 
anything I asked of it I've used the
serrations<00:04:45.050> for<00:04:45.500> wire<00:04:45.710> stripping<00:04:46.570> some

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
different tasks that I've asked so but I

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.430 
different tasks that I've asked so but I

might have been I think it might have
been<00:05:27.230> Sears<00:05:27.770> webpage<00:05:28.610> but<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.690> took<00:05:29.900> you

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
been Sears webpage but it took you

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.150 
been Sears webpage but it took you
somewhere<00:05:30.410> else

Sears<00:05:31.610> doesn't<00:05:32.000> actually<00:05:32.120> carry<00:05:32.540> them<00:05:32.690> in

Sears doesn't actually carry them in
their<00:05:32.900> store<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.960> don't<00:05:36.380> bother<00:05:36.500> going<00:05:36.800> there

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
their store so don't bother going there

I<00:05:40.520> would<00:05:40.970> rate<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.420> knife<00:05:43.630> probably<00:05:44.630> a<00:05:45.290> four

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
I would rate this knife probably a four

I would rate this knife probably a four
out<00:05:46.340> of<00:05:46.370> five<00:05:48.070> holds<00:05:49.070> up<00:05:49.190> pretty<00:05:49.220> good

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
out of five holds up pretty good

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.640 
out of five holds up pretty good
really<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.660> only<00:05:50.720> thing<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.140> keeps<00:05:51.440> it<00:05:51.590> from

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
really the only thing that keeps it from

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.860 
really the only thing that keeps it from

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
being a five out of five is this this

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.690 
being a five out of five is this this
coating<00:05:54.260> which<00:05:54.590> like<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.950> said<00:05:54.980> I<00:05:55.160> understand

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
coating which like I said I understand

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.960 
coating which like I said I understand
why<00:05:55.850> it's<00:05:56.000> on<00:05:56.150> here<00:05:56.540> but<00:05:57.440> it<00:05:57.650> just<00:05:57.860> makes<00:05:58.820> the

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
why it's on here but it just makes the

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.970 
why it's on here but it just makes the
light<00:05:59.150> that<00:05:59.720> knife<00:05:59.930> not<00:06:00.260> look<00:06:00.410> as<00:06:00.560> good<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:00.830> I

would<00:06:01.160> like<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:02.630> holds<00:06:03.410> up<00:06:03.530> very<00:06:03.560> well

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880
