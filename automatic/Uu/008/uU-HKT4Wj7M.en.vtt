00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.780
 welcome to our little one 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.510
 Nevertheless, the experts beat the series 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.730
 I am not the expert and 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.220
 I ask dr matthias marbach 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.650
 I train with 140 pulse is that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.300
 that really depends on me 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.740
 someone just says the pulse i can 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 not sure if that is one 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.250
 high or low load range 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 is because pulse ranges quite 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.750
 individually distinguish between the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 runners and what size do you need around 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.519
 to say that is the right training 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.469
 practically the maximum pulse is for when 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.260
 I put the radio on the treadmill and 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.800
 turn this runway faster and faster 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.250
 6 km h 18 12 you can still 14 but 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.170
 still 60 ovens out there we stay 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.140
 Realistic because pike are the oven 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.879
 out then with each stair step the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.260
 pulse, of course, continue to increase the pulse 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.489
 continue here where up here comes the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.770
 gong nothing works anymore 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.050
 and then we have the maximum pulse 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.360
 because it's hard but breathless 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.020
 you just can not be with me anymore 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.810
 say 176 is not that cute but that is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.479
 a maximum of 176 is a pretty low one 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.929
 max positions old man the one 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.740
 far but that is just individual 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.740
 different and so there is one here 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.840
 certain range 176 would be like I said 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 quite low maximum process comes 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.970
 but especially in older people like 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 said there are people who have 220 of it 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.080
 are today so even a piece 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.179
 you expect over 220 220 next to cannabis 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.640
 anyway, why am I playing round 76? 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.020
 train with 140 is that right now 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.819
 we have to calculate one would 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.649
 basics persistence training so one 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.459
 longer a long loose run 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.300
 one would make about 75 of the maximum pulse 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:58.210
 around 70 percent of 176 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.890
 a 32 32 632 if so here about zac 132 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.810
 now that would be for you loose 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.420
 continuous pace and if we now 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.710
 have someone with 220 maximum picks then 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.390
 the pulse gets higher there accordingly 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.510
 165 165 we just do it 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.170
 times here so zac and that would be at 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 165 pulses and you would over 30 beats 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.240
 pulse difference running but practical 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 in the same for you it is for 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.680
 you are exhausting when you are 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.940
 Equally fit since, of course, then has 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.410
 just over 30 punches here 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.000
 difference but it is actually the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.720
 same training areas that is one 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.910
 chart percent of my training happen 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.670
 About 70 then would this area 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.310
 Here then call the k1 area that is 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 the basic endurance area 1 and there 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.420
 athletes complete 70 percent 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.410
 your entire workout so long 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.239
 and what a shovel wants to put on it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.920
 where is the area where it makes sense 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.540
 is and where I am not good anymore 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.940
 so much is so shy on who 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.380
 the next point is gh2 training 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.670
 intensive training where to get longer 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.900
 intervals to perform to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.340
 for example, on the ten kilometer run 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.090
 or prepare for the marathon 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.170
 prepare 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 That would be six times 1000 meters at about 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.630
 90 percent of the maximum heart rate so 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.579
 can we reckon at 476 what 90 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.170
 percent of them laughed at the ride 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.360
 happy is less 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.459
 Well that would be an intensive training 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 can you imagine 158 is not 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.150
 more far away from the maximum pulse so 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.130
 you have intensive training on the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.440
 Pulse watch looked at the intensive run 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.410
 not unfair how do you feel then what 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.730
 it with the breathing then in the moment yes 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.230
 accelerates but very disturbed but very 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.930
 accelerates but you can still there 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.260
 walk a few kilometers 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.420
 next to us 108 and 1998 and again 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.450
 we have a comparable burden 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.219
 range though the ladies higher pulse 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.629
 I maximum has nothing to say exactly like that 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.040
 Is it her could be together if you are one 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.569
 similar performance levels have 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.250
 These pools will be together 1000 meters 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.219
 intervals run so I do that 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.319
 Nice again that we two and summarized 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.930
 Together we take our first 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.629
 maximum us the doctor comes at the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.560
 straight from case to program on us 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.750
 maybe should say again how 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.040
 it actually makes the maximum pulse 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.389
 Set either on the treadmill 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.329
 orders until nothing works and 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.070
 otherwise once 1000 meters full throttle 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.340
 running is not enough but not yet 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.199
 the maximum pulse 2 x 1000 meters correct 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.000
 full throttle with only 12 minutes break 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.620
 in between and at the end is full and 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.050
 Sprint then you get the maximum 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.389
 police, on the other hand, might make it come 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.639
 still in really 176 so and 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.169
 second, we expect 10 percent down 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.199
 Let's move on We do not train like that 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.180
 Often will be located in 10 25 percent off 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.610
 we find ourselves there in the service area 70 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.750
 as a responsible training instead 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.970
 Many Thanks 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.680
 dr matthias marquardt would have from now 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.599
 I completely change my training and 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.280
 Now the East Africans and 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.280
 a lot of success
