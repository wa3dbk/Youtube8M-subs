00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.580
 ah 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello guys or girls welcome to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.760
 the first chapter of how to start 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.760
 play the guitar being completely 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.829
 I do not know how to define it, but what it does 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.359
 I know you're going to start playing the 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:29.329
 guitar from the easiest way more 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.770
 simple and in small increments of 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.300
 difficulty 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.230
 there will be people that these chapters will 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.940
 they will look like a sovereign bullshit 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 what I have seen is that for me 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.710
 experience in schools and communities 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.350
 this kind of coordination exercises 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.960
 under the finger are the ones that are fundamental 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 then the further development as 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.149
 guitarist 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 the concepts of today's lesson of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 this week they are very simple 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 coordinate finger eye and we have on one side 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.739
 the left hand technification to be 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539
 Biestro is going to be the one that is going to be 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.090
 the fingerboard and the right hand that goes to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.430
 control this little thing called 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.340
 global 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.010
 the first moment of difficulty is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.200
 when we take the instrument not 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.280
 we need the guitar to be tuned 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.470
 So what we are going to do is that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 live at the end enabled we are going to 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 check that you have the six strings for 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.940
 that we live accustomed and what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.680
 let's use is the first string 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.630
 I always do not use the ropes and I say 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.670
 to the guys it 's like they were elevator 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.400
 they were first floor building second 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 floor third floor fourth floor fifth floor 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.530
 sixth floor with which we have first 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.970
 rope second rope third rope 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.190
 fourth rope fifth rope sixth rope 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.170
 you do not have to have the best guitar nor 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 that is clean or that the ropes are 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 new ones we just need a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.830
 guitar and a person who wants to play 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 this first phase I call a finger 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.400
 a rope a spike then what are we going 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.690
 to do is from small trees or have us 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.690
 put a sound in his head 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.480
 ok this is what is called major scale 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.470
 a lot of people would say that we are 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.790
 making a man my sun fa or 5 in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.680
 the case of the guitar if we do not do in 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
 this string will not be so I 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.990
 It's interesting that you also have that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.270
 sound in the head 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.760
 if we make any mistake at the time of 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.300
 execute the exercise you are able to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.150
 correct it 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.910
 every wrong note on the guitar is 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.650
 place at most one fret to one 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 box away from the correct note 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.210
 then we are simply going to look for the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.130
 correct we fail in the exercise 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.860
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.830
 as a theme 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.350
 and a rope the first and a plectrum 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.860
 and what we are going to do is square zero 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.440
 box two box four box five 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.050
 boxes seven box nine box 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:18.320
 basic and two to get that are 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:22.970
 what we would then be 0 2 and 4 5 7 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.970
 9 11 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.850
 if you put it from the back in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.960
 youtube the question is that you see how 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.960
 I'm placing the finger 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.090
 as if it were a parchÃ­s 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.710
 and in music we are lucky that 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.710
 many times everything that goes up low 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.349
 do not 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.099
 Y 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.470
 then we are going to repeat this some 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.650
 how many times at home 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.290
 and we are going to take the sense of 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.310
 coordination with fuck or we're just going to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.150
 have its three elements of difficulty 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.210
 a finger a rope a spike and inside 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.860
 five minutes we are back with some 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.190
 small exercises to see how 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.150
 we can combine those sounds 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.150
 take a break
