00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.559
 to talk to you today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.200
 last week I have the chance to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 do a skit in front of 300 people 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
 at the equilibrium conference on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 nutrition and bodybuilding 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.779
 departure we'll see again in sketches 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.939
 I was should we live but these five 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.680
 minutes after I realized that there 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.869
 will have real people face me kind 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 with eyes and where there is a difference 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.910
 between making youtube videos since his 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 room where you're wrong ben everything 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 simply start again quietly and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.660
 on stage or if you're going 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 for an idiot in front of 300 people and there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:54.870
 she tells me go ahead but to be honest 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.160
 with you I had almost nothing prepared 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.320
 so as much to tell you as 30 minutes 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.090
 before I went on stage I was not the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 guy the biggest in the world and I think 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.270
 that we can say that I am 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 literally at home so for you 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.939
 to situate the thing 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 the video just starts taking care 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.200
 back and I shouted game people 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.680
 I hope you are all right 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.680
 beautiful suite 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:28.409
 religion do not worry it's 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.140
 normal I'm 22 years old I perceive as if 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.179
 we dry 90 bass and I like 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.450
 honor that I do 67 centers of 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:40.140
 arm in fact I prefer 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.299
 I'm 22 years old and I tell him something juppe 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.909
 announces audition situation the term 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.649
 and dietary supplements and this 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.390
 some gesture is to break in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.770
 youtube just because I have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.810
 noticed that in the legion crypt in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 did people resume muscu be a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.849
 little misunderstanding somewhere it gets done 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.989
 than for example in business school 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:03.679
 and it's true that deezer 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.519
 threatening letters there are quite except 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.340
 for friends singing to church for 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.430
 the news 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.260
 I go out of the rice grains people 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.430
 still say what is it 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:34.209

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.250
 years well follows the apple as the ride 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.040

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.780
 jean 5 2 a little surprised to see this and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.630
 let's say we have the impression that for 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.700
 to feel a glock or a nas is more 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.410
 like a bistro island less surprised than 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:59.989
 someone from the club brings so good 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:03:09.980
 weed man and then comes the moment the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:14.320

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:21.739

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.320
 go on to the next step which is the soul 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.840
 what with a loop so like the 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.620

00:03:43.620 --> 00:04:04.849
 tense remember it was there is there 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.479

 to the bishop that it must happen sometimes 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.789
 it gets a bit tense and it becomes 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.160
 situation of a little furniture in this 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.669
