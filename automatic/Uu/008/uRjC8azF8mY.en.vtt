00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 finally she is back in operation 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.440
 metro in this case on laundry metro 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.170
 2014 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.270
 she comes with the check that should dec 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.400
 currently only for xbox one 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.739
 playable but come in gameplay and 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.050
 Although of rage optics for a horse is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.559
 then you can and that is going on now 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 background 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.940
 yes, what did I miss operation metro 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 who can attend the video online second 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.650
 what should be wunschschliste in the first place 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.110
 my wishes truth operation metro 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.390
 in march here in battlefield 2 obsession 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 loose which in some cases as well 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.320
 a similar map called 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 but in the end it comes from the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.250
 class not even remotely to the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.040
 Membrane loose is very fast 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.530
 really stupid the courses are there 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.500
 too thin in the nation metro metro has 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 usually a little wider aisles 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.259
 of course, somehow because that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.090
 Gameplay has changed for example 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.280
 is the barely revived with four 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.039
 and battlefield 3 was steve quasi 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 has locked in playful ago 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.690
 already changed what the fronts 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.929
 education the metro was present threw 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.850
 simply first class but now the new 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.399
 metro they are not easy now 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 take over the area metro no there is 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.890
 also changes first graphically us 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.690
 do not have that extreme blue color to me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 looks definitely essential first 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 better off and the metro sets in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 little bit flooded she was after 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 this nuclear attack from the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 singleplayer there she gave a paris 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.340
 and now the metro has one more 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.789
 small water level but very 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.920
 low 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.369
 to do so, for example, in the rush 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.229
 Mode left in front of the third station 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.520
 a little new gang to stop such a 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.179
 a little more franking that too 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.729
 enable 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.729
 problems really in the washboard 43 that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.780
 this station the third very difficult 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.360
 was reached 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.489
 because there were too few accounts left 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.080
 very easy to be fought there 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.690
 it's also the focus in the upper 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.770
 it's actually there it's now resting 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.580
 want a little bit there 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.440
 make it more flexible 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 There is also an elevator that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.640
 You can use it before, even if we 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.400
 There were no elevators in the three 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 come meaningful use now he is also 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.500
 operation usable thing is you 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 yes he is a wheelchair 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.710
 very often combed to see if they 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.490
 maybe a little better there 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.290
 fix 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.060
 maybe because there are so many 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.080
 As soon as possible there are only gears up 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.610
 to make the elevator 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 we'll see that will happen then 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 only times when I myself play rather 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 Experience reports have then recognized 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.800
 that's how it is after all 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.270
 outside the metro he only went to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.830
 example rush mode and I think so too 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.190
 could achieve squad deathmatch 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.590
 The grass is partly green 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.290
 now the combustible meaningful if I 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 there is something exclusive on it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.940
 once it starts to burn 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.920
 then it will be slowly getting wider 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.200
 it's already burning a bit dynamically 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.200
 not so descriptions one already knows 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 really nice when he gets up 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.560
 really a pity so is fire too 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.690
 for example, when marching firestorm 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.980
 Fire is a point of very much 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.930
 it does not hurt 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 Just run over so you were 50 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.420
 live less and live 50 already 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.150
 the players have the decision to do so 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.940
 the attackers still jetskis in the beginning 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.040
 or guesses that brings him the senses 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.780
 something more dynamic reimann can do something 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.820
 flank more 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.350
 Above all, the map years was fast that 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.070
 you as an attacker you will not 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.870
 headway 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.160
 you wanted to quickly the base remains 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.450
 and there you have a little bit of obvious 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 you could also get away everywhere 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.160
 become 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.530
 jet ski is a thing that can do that 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.650
 prevent you from doing so far 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.269
 but it is only possible now to intervene 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.670
 is going to be stronger is being shot there 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.800
 I'm curious but is on everyone 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.780
 if a thing could do that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.350
 attack something on the first station 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.760
 help a big revolution 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.530
 there is no event there is no 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.600
 skyscraper breaks down 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.070
 it does not break the whole blanket 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 once that happens in the case 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.060
 not one can but individually 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.440
 Break these pieces for a break 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.720
 bring that are very many you can 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 Just shoot with gun up 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.669
 flexible is distributed then breaks then 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.320
 the ceiling down and underlies the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.540
 dies to the senses that can 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.040
 bring in a bit of dynamism because 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.190
 the camping is more difficult if you have 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.150
 the camper can get away with it but are in 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.760
 they are still a bit annoying you 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.990
 stand there even actually runs 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.050
 This time because of these things should be in the piece 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.000
 head falls can be a bit annoying 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.670
 then there is a light switch 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.440
 at the gang where the whole spindle 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.120
 are and how the plural word for that 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.630
 Word is spinning this year too 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.650
 no matter 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.210
 There is a light switch there 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.170
 Press to have the light on 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.350
 make out 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:04.310
 yes that brings a little so so you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.630
 is also seen when it is out there 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.600
 is better to go immediately is essential 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.310
 Personally, I find something faster 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.990
 more useful than now as light switch 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.720
 make out is nice because dynamic 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.800
 thing but of effect 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.600
 well not so much but otherwise happy 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.550
 I'm very much that metro finally 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.260
 I'm back with the waxing here 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.700
 I'm already looking forward to the gameplay 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.460
 now a bit different is by holding 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.190
 new gadgets under evolution like that 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.140
 that means expires and there was one 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.210
 battlefield livestream where you are 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.240
 played very well and was there 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.190
 metro and the game mode capture the 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.760
 flag it also plays new and new 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.430
 There was not much rum around there which I believe 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.070
 I will also be at the surgery 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.230
 two game modes very be the case that 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.970
 one holds the map simply too linear and 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.910
 too few steps are that was just barely 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.370
 exception will be back if 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.810
 less players are weekenders from 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.570
 conquest if there are many players 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.400
 then it stretches together and gave 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.710
 then operation would capture the flag 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 just front against front and nothing 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.310
 runs more 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.380
 but say 6 against 6 8 against 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.900
 8.55 what you want so few 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.820
 player then you can metro if synonymous 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.110
 the really good map and on the 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.150
 new game modes like capture the flag 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.070
 could be good for it then because that was 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.520
 so my criticism of endgame with 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.180
 capture the flag that only has this 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.850
 vehicle variants gave and I had 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.680
 this infantry capture the flag was 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.070
 I also like my eyes very well 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.980
 would 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.870
 That's why I'm very excited 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.330
 this new mode and hopefully 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.460
 They can do you good 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.740
 yes that was it with this video too 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.300
 operation metro now the question to you 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.830
 you enjoy the map what we now so 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.409
 I could see if we could 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.819
 now all played twitter opinion 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.050
 a little different from his de facto 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.939
 such a small opinion 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.800
 otherwise if you have another second 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.759
 want to see assault gameplay let 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.620
 know me as well 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.080
 otherwise top right I still have the 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.120
 last weapons guides to 338 wrap 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.150
 or the bottom right the last episode of 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.509
 use apps and skin at myvideo 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.509
 three people
