early in the season that's going to be
difficult<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.930> do<00:02:17.080> when<00:02:17.290> two<00:02:17.470> out<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
difficult to do when two out of the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.470 
difficult to do when two out of the
first<00:02:18.010> three<00:02:18.190> teams<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.730> play<00:02:18.940> her<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> top

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
first three teams we play her in the top

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.870 
first three teams we play her in the top
ten<00:02:19.750> Michigan<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.320> Arkansas<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.700> that's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
ten Michigan and Arkansas but that's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.420 
ten Michigan and Arkansas but that's
going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.270> our<00:02:22.300> goal<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:24.220> what<00:02:24.400> I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
going to be our goal I think what I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.070 
going to be our goal I think what I
suggested<00:02:25.240> was<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:27.540> even<00:02:28.540> though<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.050> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
suggested was is even though this is a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.449 
suggested was is even though this is a
very<00:02:29.320> criminal<00:02:29.920> thing<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:32.800> we<00:02:33.190> should

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
very criminal thing and that we should

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.100 
very criminal thing and that we should
focus<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.660> outcome<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> lot

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
focus on the outcome I do this a lot

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.290 
focus on the outcome I do this a lot
with<00:02:38.170> players<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.130> have<00:02:39.580> issues<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
with players that have issues and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.980 
with players that have issues and
problems<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:41.730> rather<00:02:42.730> than<00:02:42.970> focus<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
problems is rather than focus on the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.020 
problems is rather than focus on the
punishment<00:02:44.560> focus<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> outcome<00:02:45.730> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
punishment focus on the outcome that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.600 
punishment focus on the outcome that
might<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> win-win<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.860> helpful<00:02:48.340> to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
might be a win-win and be helpful to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.590 
might be a win-win and be helpful to
everyone<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.160> as<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> suggestion<00:02:52.209> of

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
what might be something that would focus
