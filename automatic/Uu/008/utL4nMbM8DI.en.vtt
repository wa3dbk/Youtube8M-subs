actually<00:03:23.440> gets<00:03:23.739> split<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.069> two<00:03:24.299> now<00:03:25.299> what<00:03:25.599> this

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
actually gets split in two now what this

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.949 
actually gets split in two now what this
means<00:03:26.139> is<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.909> your<00:03:27.909> your<00:03:28.329> team<00:03:28.629> will<00:03:28.810> have

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
to flex to return and it could either

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.199 
to flex to return and it could either
make<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.250> or<00:03:33.459> break<00:03:33.699> you<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.419> mean<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:36.250> you're
