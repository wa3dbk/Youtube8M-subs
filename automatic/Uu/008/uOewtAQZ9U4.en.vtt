wind is pretty important for us hunters

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.720 
wind is pretty important for us hunters
so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> check<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:25.380> hunting<00:00:25.949> locations<00:00:26.490> are

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so I check which hunting locations are

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
so I check which hunting locations are
suitable<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.660> well<00:00:27.930> George<00:00:28.590> Stein<00:00:28.859> would

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
suitable I see well George Stein would

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
suitable I see well George Stein would
be<00:00:29.189> suitable<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> app<00:00:30.029> suggested<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
be suitable to the app suggested it to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
be suitable to the app suggested it to
me<00:00:31.800> based<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> information<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.969> entered

previously can say well I'd take over

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
previously can say well I'd take over
that<00:00:36.030> location<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:37.860> automatically

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that location and it automatically

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.229 
that location and it automatically
creates<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.030> new<00:00:39.210> entry<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.079> my<00:00:40.140> journal<00:00:40.820> or<00:00:41.820> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
exactly that anymore so in this case I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.310 
exactly that anymore so in this case I
saw<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> whitelighter<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:10.710> enter<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> age<00:01:11.250> etc

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
saw a whitelighter can enter the age etc

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
saw a whitelighter can enter the age etc
and<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> has<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:15.210> taken

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and it has been here it has also taken

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
and it has been here it has also taken
over<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.700> position<00:01:17.700> information<00:01:18.290> let's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
over all the position information let's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.899 
over all the position information let's
see<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.400> would<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.920> have

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
see what we would do if we would have

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.780 
see what we would do if we would have
shot<00:01:24.150> something<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.960> example<00:01:25.159> last<00:01:26.159> fall<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
shot something for example last fall I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.319 
shot something for example last fall I
shot<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.750> buck<00:01:28.310> see<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> information<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
shot this buck see all the information I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.370 
shot this buck see all the information I
can<00:01:30.540> enter<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.189> weapon<00:01:32.880> bullet<00:01:33.420> distance

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
can enter but my weapon bullet distance

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
can enter but my weapon bullet distance
whenever<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.549> entered<00:01:35.850> something<00:01:36.619> it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
whenever you have entered something it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
whenever you have entered something it
will<00:01:37.950> remember<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.960> next<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:42.200> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
will remember it for the next time so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
will remember it for the next time so
you<00:01:43.259> enter<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.829> information<00:01:44.040> typically<00:01:44.729> only

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you enter the information typically only

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.859 
you enter the information typically only
once<00:01:45.270> next<00:01:45.689> time<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.229> selected<00:01:47.869> okay

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
once next time you just selected okay

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.740 
once next time you just selected okay
let's<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.310> show<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.820> briefly<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
let's get that show also briefly the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.100 
let's get that show also briefly the
locations<00:01:52.280> locations<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> nice<00:01:54.810> map

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
locations locations you have a nice map

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.330 
locations locations you have a nice map
and<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.030> place<00:01:57.299> symbols<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and you can place symbols on it and you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.480 
and you can place symbols on it and you
can<00:01:59.549> configure<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.329> symbols<00:02:00.829> for<00:02:01.829> example<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
can configure the symbols for example I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.260 
can configure the symbols for example I
could<00:02:02.939> select<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:04.130> an<00:02:05.130> image<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.090> I've

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
could select here now an image that I've

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.260 
could select here now an image that I've
taken<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> past<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.970> could<00:02:09.149> also

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
taken and in the past but you could also

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.790 
taken and in the past but you could also
take<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> new<00:02:10.530> photo

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
take a new photo

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.390 
take a new photo
added<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.790> location<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:14.440> also<00:02:14.530> change

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
added to that location can also change

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.700 
added to that location can also change
the<00:02:15.670> type<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.180> tell<00:02:19.600> well<00:02:19.900> those<00:02:20.470> are

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the type and you can tell well those are

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.170 
the type and you can tell well those are
two<00:02:20.740> suitable<00:02:21.340> wind<00:02:21.550> directions

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.540
