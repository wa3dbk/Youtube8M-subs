00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello I had some time has not happened that when wanting to install a grand model 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.560
 theft auto san andreas to be in the installation you get a damn warned 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.580
 that his grand theft auto san andreas is not compatible or that you do not have the first 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.860
 version of san andreas good if it is like this today I will teach you how to convert your 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.920
 grand theft auto san andreas to the first version of san andreas' of the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.159
 U.S 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.479
 well let's start first and obviously they should have grand theft auto san andreas 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.659
 later they go to the limit the description that is called grand theft auto san 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.500
 andreas do a big pat cox network being there they do not download and they wait for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 I finished I did not download it because I already have it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 well already downloaded we executed the former 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.690
 you have already opened the program we give you next the program will ask for the directory of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.750
 his grand theft auto san andreas put it and then give him max 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.310
 When you give him NestlÃ©, an error will come out. This error almost always happens when it indicates 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 that his version of san andreas' does not exist or the program does not know it and because 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 that gives the error 'but do not be afraid that this has a solution 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.630
 now we go to the second limit the description of the video the link is called 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.290
 grand theft auto san andreas crack notter 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.600
 already being inside the limit they unload the grand theft auto san andreas does not yield 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.170
 track 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.240
 Once downloaded, they drag the lecce that comes inside the zip file to the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 desk where you want to put it 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.730
 already with the ex on the desk some other directory we go to your folder 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.700
 default game hard drive / program files / rockstargames / grand 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.460
 theft auto san andreas I for doing the backup I have the 'san 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 andreas' in my documents now we move on to the next 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.999
 now being in his gaming folder of the grand theft auto san andreas 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.699
 we replaced the exedil san andreas' by which we decompressed of the grand theft 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.739
 auto san andreas noce de crack 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.129
 already replaced in lecce now we do the test if the change was successful 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.329
 of versions to indicate a change I'll give you the example the grand radar 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.390
 theft auto 4 that only serves with the united states version ie the 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.559
 first version 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.149
 well now we realized that we have done everything right now we have a 'san 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.649
 andreas' first version and we can put more bikes that are compatible 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.459
 with the first version and that with the other versions of san andreas' no 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.319
 I worked the mod I send greetings and now I say goodbye until next time
