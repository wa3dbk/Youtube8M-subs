00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 Good, are you guys there thinking about 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 oil is the brake fluid of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
 bike and do not know how to proceed 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.849
 I'll give you a hint here of how to do 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 rapid replacement of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.980
 brakes, it 's all work out, we do not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 Needs even to do the bleeding 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.490
 for replacement then we 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.210
 I'll get a tip here started the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.210
 options to try to disrupt the maximum is 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.520
 The idea here is to make only one 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 replacement of brake fluid then 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:01:01.219
 can do here in the form of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 apple attack chiquinho phone 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.510
 so maybe if you do the replacement 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.180
 simple defends what I brake 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.119
 I recommend you are with the syringe you 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 remove excess oil 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.580
 for who is going to make the switch to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 pd leader was here in the form of 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.509
 gravity right 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 who's going to make him play if he looks 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.750
 the excess oil to take everything 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.280
 This takes away as much as you can. 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.950
 the little name here to see if the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.950
 people get a better position here 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:21.750
 here was the best I could get the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.160
 illustrate this exchange I bought a fluid 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 brake down 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.790
 the brand you see there I go 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 speak the name is to have the color will be more 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.760
 you see the procedure of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.510
 good replacement guys 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.269
 valdin mangueirinha is a way to get 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.430
 connect a nice hose not 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.650
 get home 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.220
 the portal that was throwing oil for 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.220
 top of the crisis 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.560
 and here you vote is 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.819
 return here by gravity by the weight of the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.170
 gravity the fluid will change 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:33.269
 automatically this happens new bike 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.090
 law is that it has nothing to do with 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.739
 I still hope you can note that 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.480
 here are downloading will only want to do 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.269
 add bus what you can not 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.640
 leave the power he is letting it happen 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:50.819
 Missing look here because if not 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.040
 come in at this time you will have one that 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.519
 wanted to do and hesitate when it is 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.659
 How does he look that he attacked people? 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.209
 will make it appear in the hose there so 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.730
 that appears in the hose aa exchange 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.680
 fluid is ready 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.120
 This is for you to do only one 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010
 replacement 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 I'll make another video and show you how. 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.799
 You'll do shade if it happens. 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.310
 some something wrong right 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:24.810
 Let's wait is that it's a procedure 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.550
 A little bit is slow but here it is 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.190
 person who is starting now who does not 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.110
 have the minimum knowledge 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.789
 he is doing it that way he 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.690
 It will not be any problem to have a problem. 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.300
 none of it let the brake 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.349
 a record is downloading a lot of people 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:53.280
 I was waiting to get the new oil 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:57.050
 below we concluded the service was 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:07.050
 realized oil has come down there and 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:10.860
 there is the following you go to a 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.520
 A relief here 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.520
 aluminum 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.690
 Sandro is good 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.520
 Oil came here in zinho level that is 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.710
 the level of the good part of the rubber and you 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.400
 sees that you have not lost the brake and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.610
 continued when I started to work, right? 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.860
 more than enough there now is 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.080
 Only you were champion, huh? 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.030
 the level is that of the aluminum sequence 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.200
 cap and ready 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.300
 it's a screw or it's perfect 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.950
 remembering you can not forget that 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.330
 It is to end the water was soon followed 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.510
 by yourself, he looks 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:03.540
 it can even melt eardrums use 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:04.560
 formol as the screw that the service 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.910
 it's done 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.990
 I'm not going to squeeze here that I'm going to make a 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.990
 next video
