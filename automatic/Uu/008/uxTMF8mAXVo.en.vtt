look<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> flicker<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:46.040> tells<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
look at it flicker that tells you that

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.569 
look at it flicker that tells you that
that<00:01:48.030> bulb<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.869> okay<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.979> let's<00:01:50.189> put<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.490> on

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that bulb is okay now let's put it on

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.770 
that bulb is okay now let's put it on
the<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.880> bulb<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:53.270> push<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> test<00:01:54.659> button

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the other bulb I push the test button

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
the other bulb I push the test button
and<00:01:56.060> notice<00:01:57.060> nothing's<00:01:57.689> happening<00:01:58.880> okay<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and notice nothing's happening okay that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
and notice nothing's happening okay that
tells<00:02:00.869> us<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> bulb<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
tells us that we know that the bulb is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
tells us that we know that the bulb is
bad<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.259> now<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.710> exactly<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.369> bulb<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
bad so we now know exactly which bulb to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.180 
bad so we now know exactly which bulb to
replace<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> new<00:02:07.530> bulb<00:02:07.799> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
replace if we put in a new bulb it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.139 
replace if we put in a new bulb it's
going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> work<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.640> fine

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
going to work just fine

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.500 
going to work just fine
if<00:02:10.190> both<00:02:11.190> bulbs

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
if both bulbs

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.050 
if both bulbs
stood<00:02:12.750> okay<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.319> flickered<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.610> means<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
stood okay and flickered that means the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.119 
stood okay and flickered that means the
problem<00:02:15.360> could<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> ballast<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
problem could be in the ballast and so

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.800 
problem could be in the ballast and so
you<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.459> have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> turn<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.000> control<00:02:18.510> here

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you just have to turn the control here

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380 
you just have to turn the control here
to<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> ballast<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:20.670> start<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> similar

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
to the ballast and you start a similar

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.289 
to the ballast and you start a similar
testing<00:02:22.079> procedure<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.340> only<00:02:23.519> works<00:02:23.730> for

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
testing procedure but it only works for

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.830 
testing procedure but it only works for
t8<00:02:25.159> electronic<00:02:26.159> ballasts<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.450> need<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.689> make

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
t8 electronic ballasts you need to make

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.449 
t8 electronic ballasts you need to make
sure<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.319> light<00:02:28.470> fixture<00:02:28.860> has<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
sure that your light fixture has one of

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.880 
sure that your light fixture has one of
those<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:30.200> finally<00:02:31.200> here's<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> coolest

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.240 
those and finally here's the coolest
part<00:02:32.280> about<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.489> tool<00:02:33.829> let's<00:02:34.829> say<00:02:35.040> you've

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
part about this tool let's say you've

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.990 
part about this tool let's say you've
got<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.459> fluorescent<00:02:36.120> bulb<00:02:36.269> look<00:02:36.569> at<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
got a fluorescent bulb look at this so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660 
got a fluorescent bulb look at this so
first<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.049> all<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.950> neat<00:02:41.099> thing<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.549> you've

first of all the neat thing is if you've

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
first of all the neat thing is if you've
got<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.909> bunch<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.329> bulbs<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:43.019> your<00:02:43.049> house<00:02:43.349> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
got a bunch of bulbs in your house and
you<00:02:43.709> don't<00:02:43.799> know<00:02:43.950> which<00:02:44.069> ones<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.400> good<00:02:44.579> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
you don't know which ones are good and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.059 
you don't know which ones are good and
which<00:02:44.730> ones<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.090> bad<00:02:45.500> same<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.920> can

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
which ones are bad same thing you can

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.349 
which ones are bad same thing you can
actually<00:02:47.159> test<00:02:47.640> them<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:47.849> don't<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.209> be

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
actually test them they don't have to be

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.330 
actually test them they don't have to be
in<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.480> light<00:02:48.599> fixture<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.709> turn<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.069> back<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
in the light fixture you turn it back to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.030 
in the light fixture you turn it back to
the<00:02:50.459> lamp<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.139> hold<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.409> like<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the lamp you just hold it like this and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.619 
the lamp you just hold it like this and
watch<00:02:53.310> what<00:02:53.489> happens<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.150> push<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> test

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
watch what happens I just push the test

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.379 
watch what happens I just push the test
button<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.879> see<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> bulb

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
button and you can see the bulb

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.750 
button and you can see the bulb
flickering<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> tells<00:02:58.920> us<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
flickering so that tells us that this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.930 
flickering so that tells us that this
bulb<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.239> good<00:03:00.599> it's<00:03:01.109> got<00:03:01.319> gas<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.220> all

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
bulb is good it's got gas in it all

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
bulb is good it's got gas in it all
right<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.359> if<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.170> want<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.470> make<00:03:04.620> sure<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
right now if you want to make sure that

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.289 
right now if you want to make sure that
the<00:03:05.069> filaments<00:03:05.639> okay<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:07.859> turn<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.760> tool<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
the filaments okay you turn the tool to

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.710 
the filaments okay you turn the tool to
pin<00:03:09.650> right<00:03:10.650> down<00:03:10.829> there<00:03:11.069> at<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.060> bottom<00:03:12.480> of

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
pin right down there at the bottom of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.569 
pin right down there at the bottom of
the<00:03:12.780> tool<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> spot<00:03:13.739> where<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:14.159> actually

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
the tool is a spot where you actually

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.680 
the tool is a spot where you actually
plug<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.989> two<00:03:16.290> tips<00:03:16.919> of<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.209> two<00:03:18.389> pins

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
plug in the two tips of the the two pins

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.939 
plug in the two tips of the the two pins
on<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> bulb<00:03:19.430> just<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:20.699> it<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.849> like<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.949> hit

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
on the bulb just put it in like that hit

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:28.129 
on the bulb just put it in like that hit
the<00:03:23.099> test<00:03:23.280> button<00:03:23.720> here<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:26.419> that<00:03:27.419> tells<00:03:27.840> us

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
the test button here that that tells us

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.740 
the test button here that that tells us
that<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.769> filament<00:03:29.370> from<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.209> end<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that the filament from this end of the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.199 
that the filament from this end of the
bulb<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.319> okay<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.160> actually<00:03:32.489> test<00:03:32.819> both

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bulb is okay and you actually test both

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.330 
bulb is okay and you actually test both
ends<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> bulb<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.590> see<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.980> filament

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
ends of the bulb to see if the filament

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.369 
ends of the bulb to see if the filament
is<00:03:35.400> good<00:03:35.579> but<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.540> see<00:03:36.750> how<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.079> will<00:03:37.230> be

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
is good but can you see how this will be

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.030 
is good but can you see how this will be
a<00:03:37.410> huge<00:03:37.859> time-saver<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.359> great<00:03:39.629> tool

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
a huge time-saver it's a great tool

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.890 
a huge time-saver it's a great tool
