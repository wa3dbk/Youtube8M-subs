 product that is characterized by 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.680
 from the water it resurrected that we are much

 radicchio is not that it is made on 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
 soil but grows on the pa later 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.190
 we will find the various processing steps 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.159
 to get to this special product 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.740
 is the first phase it means to have 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.390
 the optimal product raffin is a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.000
 product that is eaten this radicchio 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 been picked up in the field and now in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.860
 this time we put it on these 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 iron baskets or you can kill yourself 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.299
 as you want here we see the heart that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 going will go to grow in the water 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.860
 especially that part due to us 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.220
 we are going to eat while this room 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.600
 all the part where it was cleaned up yes 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 puts it in the baskets and then it will go to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 put on the greenhouse that forcing or 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.829
 magnification 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.860
 where there is the function of spring water 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.960
 at 13 degrees which will make the heart grow 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.759
 what they say what you eat the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.549
 flower that you hands 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.479
 here we find the second phase of the shield 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.060
 production of radicchio di treviso igp 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.860
 as you can see here issued a tank 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.380
 forcing the procedure 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 of the painter therefore also chin wants 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.979
 say when the middle part that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 we have seen before 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.599
 field increase grows especially in 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.050
 water this is the part where you will go to 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:17.940
 eating water has a temperature of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.160
 13 degrees Celsius and it takes about 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.690
 about twenty days to succeed 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.700
 whitewash the growing radicchio 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.770
 however this goes according to the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.720
 external temperature 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.099
 having temperatures like this morning 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.480
 under 2 degrees 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.110
 we will need younger ones 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.210
 radicchio is able to mature 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.640
 at this moment we are in 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.670
 most final stage in the processing of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.410
 radicchio that can then take it to the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.440
 market and in our tables 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.800
 who is the external culture of the leaves 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.510
 story but the heart that has grown into 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.430
 water can tell you what you will go to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.540
 eat here we see the stage of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.700
 processing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.870
 another down represents ture in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.660
 root the skillful hands that succeed in 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
 clean here we are now in the last 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.490
 product phase to then bring a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.310
 market on our tables for 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:15.510
 eat it that you see that is on 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 igp marked package meters lid 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.500
 then seal stamp e 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 that guarantees the igp product to the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:34.959
 brand can find various types of 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.450
 packs of one kilo two kilos 5 kg 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.170
 for example we have a scapula of 2 kg 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.410
 which is very optimal for some gifts 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.480
 some details 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.380
 thought you can do that was always 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.720
 closed it is stained with the seal of 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.660
 warranty 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.380
 and this that distinguishes the real 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.380
 igp product
