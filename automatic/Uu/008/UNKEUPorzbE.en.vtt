alright<00:00:12.630> you're<00:00:12.750> looking<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.280> 83<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> 78

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
alright you're looking at the 83 and 78

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.630 
alright you're looking at the 83 and 78
I<00:00:15.379> motherboard<00:00:16.379> check<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.890> thing<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.279> it's

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I motherboard check this thing out it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.660 
I motherboard check this thing out it's
absolutely<00:00:18.320> tiny<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> really<00:00:20.490> cool

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
absolutely tiny and it is really cool

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
absolutely tiny and it is really cool
probably<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.270> perfect<00:00:21.800> motherboard<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
probably the perfect motherboard for a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
probably the perfect motherboard for a
home<00:00:23.250> theater<00:00:23.609> PC<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> yes<00:00:24.420> perfect<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.140> use

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
home theater PC and yes perfect i use

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
home theater PC and yes perfect i use
the<00:00:25.410> word<00:00:25.439> perfect<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.039> that's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the word perfect because that's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.960 
the word perfect because that's
basically<00:00:26.869> what<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.560> mini-itx<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.939> i

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
basically what it is it's mini-itx so i

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.030 
basically what it is it's mini-itx so i
mean<00:00:30.210> obviously<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.619> full<00:00:31.859> size

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
mean obviously it's it's not full size

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
mean obviously it's it's not full size
motherboard<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.579> very<00:00:32.850> small<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.840> why

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
motherboard it's very small so why

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.170 
motherboard it's very small so why
they're<00:00:34.050> using<00:00:34.320> amex<00:00:34.649> NBC<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.430> boxy<00:00:35.940> or

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
they're using amex NBC or boxy or

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.119 
they're using amex NBC or boxy or

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
all in here and the eye on board if you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
all in here and the eye on board if you
don't<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.860> full<00:01:08.280> HD<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> matter

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
don't know will do full HD as a matter

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
don't know will do full HD as a matter
of<00:01:09.240> fact<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.630> actually<00:01:10.189> simultaneously

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
of fact it will actually simultaneously

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.359 
of fact it will actually simultaneously
decode<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.150> blu-ray<00:01:12.570> discs<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> same<00:01:13.799> time

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
decode to blu-ray discs at the same time

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.510 
decode to blu-ray discs at the same time
to<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.909> different<00:01:15.350> tvs<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.650> crazy<00:01:17.189> that's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to two different tvs that's crazy that's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
to two different tvs that's crazy that's
to<00:01:17.790> 1920<00:01:18.360> x<00:01:18.450> 1080<00:01:18.630> p<00:01:19.130> signals<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to 1920 x 1080 p signals going out to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
to 1920 x 1080 p signals going out to
two<00:01:20.610> televisions<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.150> it'll<00:01:21.390> decode<00:01:21.659> them

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
two televisions and it'll decode them

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
two televisions and it'll decode them
both<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.490> high<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:24.000> rate<00:01:24.030> rate<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
both so it's very high bit rate rate a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.730 
both so it's very high bit rate rate a
video<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.900> means<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> very

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
video that means that this is a very

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
video that means that this is a very
powerful<00:01:26.009> device<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.790> let's<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> quick
