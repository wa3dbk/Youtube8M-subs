00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449

nice although some things are a little
bit<00:00:54.690> annoying<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> black

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
bit annoying just like this the black

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
bit annoying just like this the black
bars<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> left<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:57.840> side<00:00:58.230> for

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
right corner sometimes a little hard to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
right corner sometimes a little hard to
access<00:01:23.130> those<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.720> I've<00:01:24.840> heard<00:01:24.869> I

haven't<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:25.890> tried<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
haven't actually tried that because I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
haven't actually tried that because I
don't<00:01:27.060> play<00:01:27.180> too<00:01:27.240> many<00:01:27.509> games<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.049> iPhone

going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.570> ahead<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.900> start<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> run<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
going to go ahead and start up a run so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
going to go ahead and start up a run so
basically<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.460> cool<00:01:44.729> using

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
basically it's it's really cool using

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.219 
basically it's it's really cool using
the<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.840> iphone<00:01:46.259> 5<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.740> these<00:01:47.009> new<00:01:47.250> portrait

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
the the iphone 5 on these new portrait

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.520 
the the iphone 5 on these new portrait
games<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.450> room<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.350> like

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
games so you have more like room to like

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.730 
games so you have more like room to like
see<00:01:52.860> ahead<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.659> I'll<00:01:54.780> doodle<00:01:55.470> jump

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
stuff like that all these portrait

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
stuff like that all these portrait
orientation<00:01:57.719> based<00:01:58.500> games<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.130> they're

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549

mission<00:02:35.820> right<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.209> we're<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.600> take

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
mission right here we're going to take

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.230 
mission right here we're going to take
off<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> we're<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.970> first

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
off you can see that we're in the first

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.360 
off you can see that we're in the first
person<00:02:39.690> view<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.680> definitely<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.100> really

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
person view it's definitely a really

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.580 
person view it's definitely a really
cool<00:02:41.550> application<00:02:42.209> has<00:02:42.450> pretty<00:02:43.110> decent

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
cool application has pretty decent

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.100 
cool application has pretty decent
graphics<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.220> would<00:02:44.400> say<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.000> we're<00:02:45.930> just

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
graphics I would say and we're just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.870 
graphics I would say and we're just
taking<00:02:46.410> off<00:02:46.530> here

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360 

so<00:02:57.880> overall<00:02:58.390> I'm<00:02:58.630> pretty<00:02:58.959> impressed

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
so overall I'm pretty impressed

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.270 
so overall I'm pretty impressed
accelerometer<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.720> fastest<00:03:01.720> always<00:03:02.380> so

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
accelerometer is fastest always so

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.160 
accelerometer is fastest always so
definitely<00:03:03.760> nothing<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:04.900> cool

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
definitely nothing really really cool

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.680 
definitely nothing really really cool
it's<00:03:05.950> definitely<00:03:06.130> fun<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.239> we<00:03:07.270> see<00:03:07.540> that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
it's definitely fun and here we see that

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.240 
it's definitely fun and here we see that
we<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> little<00:03:08.200> bit<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.319> activity<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:09.160> we

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
we have a little bit of activity that we

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.520 
we have a little bit of activity that we
have<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.550> take<00:03:09.880> out<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:11.050> I'm<00:03:11.140> going<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.349> go

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
have to take out so I'm going to go

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.460 
have to take out so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:12.099> turn<00:03:12.640> around<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.239> go<00:03:13.630> higher<00:03:14.140> on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
ahead and turn around and go higher on

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:22.710 
ahead and turn around and go higher on
these<00:03:14.709> these<00:03:15.430> guys<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.120> fired<00:03:22.420> on

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
these these guys so we just fired on

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.970 
these these guys so we just fired on
them<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:25.090> cleared<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.540> out<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> that's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
them and we cleared it out so that's

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.440 
them and we cleared it out so that's
pretty<00:03:27.130> much<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.849> demo<00:03:28.090> I'm<00:03:28.269> going<00:03:28.300> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
pretty much the the demo I'm going to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.750 
pretty much the the demo I'm going to
show<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:29.200> showing<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.760> basically

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
show you and just showing you basically

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280 
show you and just showing you basically
the<00:03:30.940> accelerometer<00:03:31.630> works<00:03:31.870> really<00:03:32.170> well

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the accelerometer works really well

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.729 
the accelerometer works really well
there's<00:03:33.220> no<00:03:33.489> lag<00:03:33.819> at<00:03:34.209> all<00:03:34.299> in<00:03:34.930> games<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.500> course

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
there's no lag at all in games of course

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.920 
there's no lag at all in games of course
the<00:03:35.830> iphone<00:03:36.130> 4s<00:03:36.459> didn't<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.000> lag<00:03:37.239> unless

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the iphone 4s didn't really lag unless

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.220 
the iphone 4s didn't really lag unless
you<00:03:38.080> had<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> million<00:03:39.330> intensive<00:03:40.330> games<00:03:40.690> open

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
you had a million intensive games open

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.780 
you had a million intensive games open
so<00:03:41.530> they<00:03:41.680> were<00:03:41.739> all<00:03:41.980> paused<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
so they were all paused in the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
so they were all paused in the
background<00:03:43.239> sometimes<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.230> can<00:03:44.350> cause<00:03:44.530> a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
background sometimes that can cause a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.590 
background sometimes that can cause a
lag<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.730> we're<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:45.940> going<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.269> go<00:03:46.390> ahead<00:03:46.480> and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
lag but we're just going to go ahead and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.750 
lag but we're just going to go ahead and
end<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:47.830> anyway<00:03:48.100> guys<00:03:48.280> if<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.730> enjoyed
