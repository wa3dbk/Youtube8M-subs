other teams really because they have

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
some positions in their players at that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.150 
some positions in their players at that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
was my first option and then I didn't

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
was my first option and then I didn't
really<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.260> team<00:00:52.500> would

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
really like the way that that team would

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580 
really like the way that that team would
have<00:00:52.800> turned<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.230> get

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

like<00:01:00.660> every<00:01:00.930> starter<00:01:01.230> pack<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:01.890> skip

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like every starter pack but I just skip

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.390

as I could you guys will probably find

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
as I could you guys will probably find

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
ended up not going in and the opponent

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.460 
ended up not going in and the opponent
clears<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.140> end<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
clears it and that is the end of the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.460 
clears it and that is the end of the
game<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.950> reason<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.940> went<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.989> 10<00:02:28.230> nail<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
game and the reason I went to 10 nail I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.050 
game and the reason I went to 10 nail I
know<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.190> are<00:02:29.220> asking<00:02:29.459> why<00:02:29.819> would

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
know some of you are asking why would

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.149 
know some of you are asking why would
you<00:02:30.180> beat<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> team<00:02:31.440> 10<00:02:31.709> nil<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.069> you

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
you beat the at the team 10 nil when you

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.009 
you beat the at the team 10 nil when you
only<00:02:32.310> need<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.849> 25<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.540> get<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.750> maximum

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
only need to go 25 to get the maximum

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
only need to go 25 to get the maximum
coins<00:02:34.349> well<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> reason<00:02:35.159> I<00:02:35.340> did<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.579> really

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
coins well the reason I did that really

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.750 
coins well the reason I did that really
was<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.349> get<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> feel<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.069> my<00:02:38.190> team<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
was to just get a feel for my team I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.330 
was to just get a feel for my team I
usually<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.629> when<00:02:40.230> i<00:02:40.260> create<00:02:41.040> starter

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
usually do that when i create starter

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.190 
usually do that when i create starter
packs<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> first<00:02:41.879> game<00:02:42.120> i<00:02:42.150> play<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.780> usually

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
packs the first game i play is usually

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.580 
packs the first game i play is usually
always<00:02:43.470> an<00:02:43.890> offline<00:02:44.519> game<00:02:44.849> mode<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.590> it's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
always an offline game mode and it's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.280 
always an offline game mode and it's
usually<00:02:47.220> played<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.269> easy<00:02:48.299> difficulty<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
usually played on easy difficulty and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.039 
usually played on easy difficulty and
i'm<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.739> looking<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.940> understand<00:02:51.930> my

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
i'm just looking to understand my

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.199 
i'm just looking to understand my
players<00:02:52.349> some<00:02:52.620> more<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.489> what<00:02:53.940> players

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
players some more and see what players

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.059 
players some more and see what players
can<00:02:54.450> do<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.780> things<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.440> used<00:02:55.859> to

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
can do what things and get used to

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
can do what things and get used to
bronze<00:02:56.340> players<00:02:56.609> because<00:02:56.970> i'm<00:02:57.120> definitely

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
bronze players because i'm definitely

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.930 
bronze players because i'm definitely
not<00:02:57.750> used<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.319> them<00:02:58.440> at<00:02:58.590> all<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.950> pretty<00:02:59.849> much

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
not used to them at all and pretty much

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.630 
not used to them at all and pretty much
that's<00:03:00.090> my<00:03:00.540> reasoning<00:03:01.049> for<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.640> unleashing

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
that's my reasoning for just unleashing

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.089 
that's my reasoning for just unleashing
the<00:03:02.760> beast<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.659> team<00:03:03.989> i<00:03:04.319> was<00:03:04.739> playing<00:03:04.950> on

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the beast on that team i was playing on

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.280 
the beast on that team i was playing on
semi-pro<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.879> really<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> spectacular

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
semi-pro so really not a spectacular

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.050 
semi-pro so really not a spectacular
achievement<00:03:07.859> but<00:03:07.980> i<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.609> wanted<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.879> get<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
achievement but i just wanted to get a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.750 
achievement but i just wanted to get a
little<00:03:09.359> feel<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.540> my<00:03:09.840> team<00:03:10.079> if<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.440> guys

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
little feel for my team if you guys

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.460 
little feel for my team if you guys
understand<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.909> but<00:03:12.659> i<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:12.900> back<00:03:13.079> into<00:03:13.290> my

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
understand that but i go back into my

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.430 
understand that but i go back into my
manager<00:03:13.920> tasks<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:15.239> got<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.900> challenge

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
manager tasks and I got that challenge

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.259 
manager tasks and I got that challenge
for<00:03:16.680> player<00:03:16.980> first<00:03:17.280> match<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.669> a<00:03:17.730> tournament

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
for player first match in a tournament

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.870 
for player first match in a tournament
and<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.900> player<00:03:19.290> first<00:03:19.769> seasonal<00:03:20.669> match

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and I see player first seasonal match
