out the nutrients readjusted the pH

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.910 
out the nutrients readjusted the pH
seems<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> keeps<00:00:25.350> wanting<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> climb<00:00:25.890> up

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
to the seven point 0 range so I keep

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.890 
to the seven point 0 range so I keep
popping<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> 6.1<00:00:29.340> 6.2<00:00:29.900> 5.9

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.550 
say hey I'm hungrier than what i'm
getting<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.850> top<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.900> me<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.200> nutrient

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
getting up top put me in the nutrient

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.550 
getting up top put me in the nutrient
solution<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:54.150> then<00:01:54.240> another<00:01:54.900> thing<00:01:55.140> i<00:01:55.350> wanted

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
solution and then another thing i wanted

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
solution and then another thing i wanted
to<00:01:55.650> mention<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.930> little

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to mention was right there this little

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.890 
to mention was right there this little
bag<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:59.340> called<00:01:59.729> saima<00:02:00.030> life<00:02:00.300> it's<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
bag is called saima life it's a

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.480 
bag is called saima life it's a
biocatalyst<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:01.920> i<00:02:01.950> talked<00:02:02.190> about<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
biocatalyst it's what i talked about in

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450 
biocatalyst it's what i talked about in
my<00:02:02.580> previous<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> does<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
my previous video and what it does is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.080 
my previous video and what it does is
essentially<00:02:06.420> speed<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:07.110> reactions<00:02:08.090> within

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
essentially speed up reactions within

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
essentially speed up reactions within
the<00:02:09.269> plan<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.720> plant<00:02:10.019> taking<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.830> nutrients

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the plan so plant taking in nutrients

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
the plan so plant taking in nutrients
converting<00:02:11.730> nutrients<00:02:12.180> into<00:02:12.990> vegetative

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
converting nutrients into vegetative

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.800 
converting nutrients into vegetative
growth<00:02:13.590> flowers<00:02:14.250> etc<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.360> speeds<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
growth flowers etc it speeds that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.300 
growth flowers etc it speeds that
process<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.380> from<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.650> i<00:02:16.680> understand<00:02:17.160> i

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
process up from what i understand i

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.820 
process up from what i understand i
haven't<00:02:17.550> done

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
haven't done

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.280 
haven't done
as<00:02:17.890> much<00:02:18.100> research<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
as much research as I want to do and I

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.260 
as much research as I want to do and I
hope<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.100> little<00:02:21.250> bit<00:02:21.370> more<00:02:21.490> soon<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
hope to do a little bit more soon but it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.330 
hope to do a little bit more soon but it
really<00:02:22.840> looks<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.260> doing<00:02:23.440> well<00:02:23.620> now<00:02:24.160> again

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
need to put a couple more seedlings in

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.820 
need to put a couple more seedlings in
the<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.180> pods<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.290> for<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.530> most<00:03:02.709> part

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
the in the pods but for the most part

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.350 
the in the pods but for the most part
we're<00:03:03.160> growing<00:03:03.340> almost<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.910> same<00:03:04.090> stuff

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
we're growing almost the same stuff

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940 
we're growing almost the same stuff
except<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:04.930> I've<00:03:04.990> got<00:03:05.140> some<00:03:05.290> peppers<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
except for I've got some peppers on the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.199 
except for I've got some peppers on the
bottom<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:09.490> maybe<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.820> little<00:03:09.970> bit<00:03:10.150> of

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
bottom and I think maybe a little bit of

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.150 
bottom and I think maybe a little bit of
cabbage<00:03:10.600> not<00:03:11.230> one<00:03:11.320> hundred<00:03:11.380> percent<00:03:11.560> sure<00:03:11.800> I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
cabbage not one hundred percent sure I

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.490 
cabbage not one hundred percent sure I
should<00:03:12.550> really<00:03:12.700> take<00:03:12.850> my<00:03:13.000> own<00:03:13.090> advice<00:03:13.120> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
should really take my own advice and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.660 
should really take my own advice and
write<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.620> down<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.860> little<00:03:14.950> bit<00:03:15.190> more<00:03:15.430> in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
write this down a little bit more in

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.240 
write this down a little bit more in
depth<00:03:16.320> but<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.470> now<00:03:17.560> that's<00:03:17.740> what's<00:03:17.980> going<00:03:18.160> on

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
depth but for now that's what's going on
