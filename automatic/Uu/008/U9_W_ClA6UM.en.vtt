hello and welcome today I'll share a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.870 
hello and welcome today I'll share a
trick<00:00:04.250> called<00:00:05.250> connecting<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.419> boxes<00:00:07.880> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
trick called connecting the boxes the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.340 
trick called connecting the boxes the
playing<00:00:09.210> area<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> square<00:00:11.690> inside<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.170> have

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
playing area is a square inside we have

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:23.239 
playing area is a square inside we have
six<00:00:14.100> boxes<00:00:15.859> for<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> straight<00:00:17.789> line<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:22.249> the

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
six boxes for on a straight line and the

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.569 
six boxes for on a straight line and the
object<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.849> to<00:00:23.939> connect<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:25.829> boxes<00:00:26.249> with

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
object is to connect the boxes with

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.560 
object is to connect the boxes with
one's<00:00:27.259> boxes<00:00:28.259> with<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.589> tools<00:00:28.999> and<00:00:29.999> the<00:00:30.179> boxes

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
one's boxes with the tools and the boxes

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.660 
one's boxes with the tools and the boxes
with<00:00:30.810> threes<00:00:31.250> with<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> line

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.420 

the<00:00:35.670> rule<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.150> a<00:00:36.480> line<00:00:37.470> can<00:00:37.770> never<00:00:38.040> cross

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the rule is a line can never cross

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.510 
the rule is a line can never cross
another<00:00:38.820> line<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> that's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.599 

you<00:00:45.520> have<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.940> stay<00:00:46.210> inside<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:47.650> box

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.729 

so<00:00:52.219> if<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> connect<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> ones<00:00:54.739> we

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so if we want to connect the ones we

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.569 
so if we want to connect the ones we
could<00:00:55.890> draw<00:00:56.159> a<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.429> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.490 

but<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.749> connect<00:01:01.109> threes<00:01:02.359> well<00:01:03.500> we

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but if we want to connect threes well we

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.010 
but if we want to connect threes well we
can<00:01:04.680> draw<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> line<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
can draw a line like this on this

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.380 
can draw a line like this on this
most<00:01:08.619> people<00:01:09.070> won't<00:01:09.280> be<00:01:09.460> able<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.850> figure<00:01:10.119> it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
most people won't be able to figure it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.620 
most people won't be able to figure it
out<00:01:10.540> because<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.189> line<00:01:12.490> between<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.299> threes

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
out because the line between the threes

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.190 
out because the line between the threes
will<00:01:13.990> cut<00:01:14.259> off<00:01:15.330> alliance<00:01:16.330> between<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.810> ones

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
will cut off alliance between the ones

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.010 
will cut off alliance between the ones
or<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> twos<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.390> when<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.780> see<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.789> actual

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
or the twos but when you see the actual

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.279 
or the twos but when you see the actual
solution<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.560> will<00:01:23.740> become<00:01:24.130> pretty<00:01:24.399> obvious

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
solution it will become pretty obvious

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:33.200 
solution it will become pretty obvious
that's<00:01:26.289> sure

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 

now<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> possibility<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.370> connect<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
now we have a possibility to connect the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.680 
now we have a possibility to connect the
ones<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.590> tools<00:01:38.060> without<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.480> lines

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
ones and the tools without the lines

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.010 
ones and the tools without the lines
crossing<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:42.300> was<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.780> trick

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
crossing and that was the trick

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.890 
crossing and that was the trick
connecting<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.980> boxes<00:01:44.570> thank<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.720> for

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
connecting the boxes thank you for

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.270 
connecting the boxes thank you for
watching<00:01:46.820> see<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.910> next<00:01:47.970> time
