00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 to the analysis more like today 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.580
 I hope very well that the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.200
 Christmas in fact I cum and the reindeer and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 I welcome you another day here in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 biteri basics and if they want to learn how 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 I made these antlers with flowers no more 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.769
 in the information box that I left 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.010
 the video link of how I made them 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.500
 Christmas or Christmas at Christmas 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.660
 time when we all get fat as a family 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.939
 reheated before three weeks 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.320
 time where the family dresses in red 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.509
 and green as if it were on 16 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.840
 September also has photos with santa 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.149
 and some in the family where they combine 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.590
 I hope it's a goat in the photo already 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.930
 we have details with our future 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.940
 boyfriend we see titanic on December 24 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.800
 which I do not know why they put it in the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.750
 television every 24 so is the movie 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.340
 less festive than I know times where 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.579
 it snows good in the movies because here 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.500
 it does not snow queen there is happiness with che 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.090
 and with luck piñata the thing is that the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.010
 we can not break a piñata 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.450
 because apparently we are more mature for 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.070
 that also to pounce on 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.680
 sweets do not know what age but 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.210
 It seems that I already had it and what else 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.460
 like Christmas is not even the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.259
 Christmas but the nutcracker today I 'm going 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.240
 to teach to do some super things 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.710
 very rich so come with me you have 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 start greeting people 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
 nati mendoza and daniel olivera a great 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 I hug both of you and if you want me to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 greet branches leave it in the comments 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 but nothing of albums please now yes 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.319
 to begin we are going to pour in a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 blender a packet of flour for 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.409
 prepare the cake 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.630
 in my case I chose the outlet bet it's more 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.820
 super Christmas a cup and a half of water 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 half a cup of vegetable oil and three 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.649
 eggs we put it at low speed 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380
 30 seconds and then at medium speed 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.270
 for 2 minutes he just moved a bit to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
 that reached all the stuck flour that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.709
 was on the walls of the container with 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.109
 the rossi oil a mold and pouring the 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.880
 content in the I chose one in the form of 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.500
 heart but it really does not matter the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.140
 way because then we'll leave the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.060
 preparation we put it in the microwave in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340
 the description box I leave the time 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.170
 and what temperature because it varies then what 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.390
 we get if you're a child to help you get a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.039
 adult in the whole process and since we 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.039
 we are going to undo it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.030
 use a large and deep container and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 that you have passed it from the mold 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.770
 container it is time to undo it with the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.630
 hands then you add two bars of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.410
 classical philadelphia and we're going to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.660
 stir it well 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.970
 a tip so that it is not difficult for them is 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.250
 leave the philadelphia outside the refrigerator 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.990
 hour before using it so they are not very 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 hard and are easier to mold 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.890
 after mixing with my hands 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.780
 help with a spoon and there will be a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.120
 Very nice homogeneous color 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.660
 and now we 're going to move it to a tray 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.660
 clean 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 although I think it's easier with the 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.490
 hands 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
 and we talk about it so it looks good 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.459
 beautiful 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.950
 Make the thickness of the dough 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.690
 you want to take the pops so 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.459
 this is the moment when you decide what 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.459
 so big or you guys want them 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.150
 to the freezer for 20 minutes 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.230
 what we are going to do is cut it from the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.239
 size we want 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.069
 I was cutting it in pictures and 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.010
 rectangles and then the two lines 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.870
 diagonals that will be from the roof with a 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.360
 spatula and the hands you pass on the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.970
 side that has paper will now be if only 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.709
 it's a matter of decorating with brown polish if you see 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.930
 that does not allow to decorate well with bitumen 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.360
 you can put it back in the freezer 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.459
 for a while I also put the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.290
 plastic sticks do it with care or 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.239
 to cross is the house 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 also add some decoration 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.230
 Christmas I put the sticks very 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.390
 cute 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.879
 and on the chest and on the sides with the bitumen 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.860
 white that resemble snow this is 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.019
 super important because if you put it on 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.909
 the silhouette of the house helps a lot 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.819
 see as a house and not as a square 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.769
 weird and you can finally add 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.260
 Confetti on the roof injects his life 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.200
 with those colors and the last step is 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.420
 put it in the freezer one day and it's gone 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.580
 It's super nice I recommend doing it 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.920
 because it looks super Christmas and is so 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.549
 nice I know if they say 'do not pick them up and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.940
 not only see it 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.039
 I already tried it the same as it is and is 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.629
 delicious liked the cake house 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.580
 ginger I like that you can 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.740
 decorate it in different ways here is 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.169
 another version with the door knob 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.330
 that is pink and I put a little heart and 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.280
 also with more decoration you make him like 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.440
 you want but remember it's always a 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.419
 contour white line that helps a lot 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.190
 You can also do it without the stick and 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.129
 It looks very nice on a plate like 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.870
 dessert for December now we will do the 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.879
 types of hearts we will begin with the 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.919
 pallets we should just put on a 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.409
 tray a paper will start 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.240
 accommodating two candy posts together 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.219
 to those in heart shape add a 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.199
 plastic stick so that it is the most 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.599
 possible right and continue with the rest 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.449
 a head palette and not one of 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.099
 head and another normal then melt 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.810
 white chocolate in the microwave in the 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.580
 information box I tell you how to 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.740
 Do not burn yourself and fill in the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.139
 heart with chocolate helping us 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.550
 a spatula or small spoon treats 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.379
 that the chocolate is not completely 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.139
 melted so that it does not get out of 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.030
 heart and harden a little earlier when 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.060
 we have finished we should just add the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.220
 decorated you can add chuchito 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.060
 granillo that is like the little ones but 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.440
 bigger 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.820
 I say small edible confetti too 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.710
 they can scratch some canes of 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.720
 candy use those that broke me at 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.270
 out of its sheath and that the check 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.240
 next to a little chuchitos we put it 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.460
 half an hour to the freezer and it was already 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.800
 as they prefer with granites or 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.810
 little ones mix confetti or caramel 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.480
 shredded to me I love everyone and they know 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.610
 very rich 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.440
 and the last dessert is very similar to 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.030
 previous only that it is not a palette 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.770
 what we do not add the stick of 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.540
 plastic and you can do it from different 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.850
 sizes if you want a heart less 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.980
 thin and smaller just cut it with 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.500
 help of scissors try not to be 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.790
 a very thick stick but thin and 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.320
 after that as with the 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.020
 pallets just tuck it half an hour to 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.450
 Freezer and you can do it 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.370
 with much granillo or little that is 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.040
 white and green red to match with 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.660
 the colors of the canes or red rose 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.540
 and white if the canes do not have the 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.310
 green color that they thought were beautiful 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.380
 prefer the house in the palette of 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.600
 heart or individual hearts 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.610
 let me know in comments to them 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.820
 I want very much and see you soon kiss 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.820
 bye
