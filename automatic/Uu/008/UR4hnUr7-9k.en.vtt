00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.100
 channel from the subscriber and in the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.690
 description 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.600
 so we have that and yes I have today 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.460
 actually only a short thing I 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.890
 wanted to attach here so because that 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.629
 Gameplay is really short 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.479
 because just everyone really goes off 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.200
 Subscription and indeed we have something in the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.729
 kind of done before 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.060
 This time we do everything but one 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.229
 less skilled and what we do 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.320
 we will come to that more skillfully now 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.380
 Everyone does that so I'll give you one below 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.970
 in the description a link to a 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.220
 video poste and there I want you 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.229
 call that you all go there and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.670
 I'll write something like you 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.829
 met recently in the city or 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.140
 that may be that you last at edeka 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.860
 have been or just aldi or lidl 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.079
 or somehow something so all write 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.670
 thing is that all have the pleasure to write 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:55.740
 that you are the person of this 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.430
 have seen video stop in real life 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.329
 everyone and no one please write you come 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.500
 from totti 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.030
 we'll just leave that out and if that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.149
 but make some one again 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.250
 then you should give this simple one 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 thumb down right about it not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.739
 on it gives the whole thing a thumb 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 Down is reported as spam and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.580
 quickly writes another one 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.850
 thing to do that a bit 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.130
 continues to slide down and now 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.140
 Of course you will ask yourself whom 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.060
 I would like to do that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.590
 no secret to do it 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.290
 is now well-to have yourself 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.350
 I subscribe to it for a short time I know 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.010
 Not at all, why is the channel somehow? 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.140
 should from 1 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.270
 although he is so huge somehow 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 and I think that's really good 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.440
 I have to say now and therefore 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.240
 Let's just make them there 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.500
 the video but as I said only that me 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.750
 packed in the description below 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.670
 have and yes I 've heard about Julia 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.600
 hero, they are a few, so to speak 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.820
 both yes the nuk with hat live from 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.830
 the colors with me from time to time 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.590
 the subscribers are happy to look 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.640
 I mean gameplay but it looks rather 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.530
 not from that is the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880
 Probability that if here 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.220
 nobody babbles and everyone here 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.250
 be reasonable with that he is relative 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.600
 quickly finds out who the whole here 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.890
 which are relatively small and there I am 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.670
 I'm curious because it's small me 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.590
 Of course the whole thing was to follow 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.480
 because you are very curious how he insists 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.510
 He reacts if he even goes to who 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.550
 or if he just amazes me 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.260
 I hope that as much as possible of 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.130
 you can join in but then you can 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.290
 I'm actually on you 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.550
 I know that's it 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.770
 already been for today 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.540
 I really like this action 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.790
 is also here a bit again 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.590
 cohesion in the community and such and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.450
 whoever then say here's 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.030
 no cohesion with such an action 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.980
 you are welcome to participate in that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 this cohesion in all cases 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.750
 is further strengthened 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.780
 because only moan and talk bad 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.660
 does not want to continue the times 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 Roll up your sleeve and do something yourself 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.840
 against doing so it was about one 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.150
 attitude but only complain 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.799
 Of course it is easier but we do not care 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.780
 digress from the topic you know 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 modest thing to do is I'm all 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.520
 thank you very much 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.520
 Thank you for looking at this 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.490
 video and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.580
 yes, especially to the people who me 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.319
 here really almost daily or really 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.849
 daily support 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.220
 There are many names that I really have 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.349
 every day in the comments below the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.060
 video / heartfelt thanks to you without 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.680
 you will not work like that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.669
 but it's about me changing that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.849
 always want to do and if you do not want to 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.849
 again
