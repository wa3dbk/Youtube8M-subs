00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 How do you want the name to be? 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.860
 pronounced within the game already the next 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 is the appearance is there where you put the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.020

 as a hair and a beard. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 game face and then we can explain 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 How will staff work besides 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 the side has where you choose the position 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 what position he is a player is a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.960
 half a quarterback if it is a central one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.180
 side a goalkeeper 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.030
 already the law after position you can see 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 where they have a small weight 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.009
 which is the physical where you are going to put 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.920
 height of your player is the leg that he 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.610
 I will not hit the carriage, and that's how it goes. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 other than that shirt without the law is the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 accessories as the shirt stays on is the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.869
 football boot and so on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 Okay, okay, that's the kick. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.049
 the kick is strong and hits me well from outside 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 area but it will not triple well and so will 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.229
 The novelty of this fifa 15 is the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 personality because the cup actually 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.310

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.869
 Way the guy hit the corner, the way 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.939
 that the guy will hit the penalty kick too 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 there is third in the third option 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.230
 which is a default of celebration or 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.310

 you already know who is the player who 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.470

 to use because it was blocked 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.550
 then the law also has at level 10 plus 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.529
