00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
throughout the video and all that stuff
and<00:00:25.230> I've<00:00:25.500> been<00:00:25.529> used<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.760> camera

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and I've been used to using that camera

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.640 
and I've been used to using that camera
I'd<00:00:27.269> prefer<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> use<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.050> camera<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I'd prefer to use that camera but I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.019 
I'd prefer to use that camera but I
can't<00:00:28.859> find<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.250> camera<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.789> stock

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
from the last video I'm definitely going

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389

mic<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> sucks<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.320> did

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
mic which kind of sucks because I did

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.750 
mic which kind of sucks because I did
want<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> use<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.159> outside<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> thought

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
want to use that one outside I thought

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060 
want to use that one outside I thought
it<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.060> cool<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.560> shooting<00:01:07.560> tutorials

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it would be cool for shooting tutorials

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.000 
it would be cool for shooting tutorials
like<00:01:08.790> basketball<00:01:09.240> shooting<00:01:09.420> tutorials<00:01:10.010> but

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
like basketball shooting tutorials but

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
like basketball shooting tutorials but
I'll<00:01:11.670> figure<00:01:11.850> something<00:01:12.180> else<00:01:12.240> off<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I'll figure something else off for that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
I'll figure something else off for that
stuff<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> future<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.189> anyway<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.520> let's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
stuff in the future but anyway so let's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.310 
stuff in the future but anyway so let's
just<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.090> ahead<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:15.990> these

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
just go ahead and get right into these

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
just go ahead and get right into these
guys<00:01:16.700> alright<00:01:17.700> guys<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.450> saying
