 to show you how this is done 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.689
 good procedure I look for in the fy 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.409
 when you find the artist who 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.479

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.170
 sorry I 'm always going a little fast and 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.450
 finishing having copied the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.729
 password let's go to english carlo 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.770
 and let's give them another publicity I'm going 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.360
 to leave 12 minutes of advertising then 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.369
 of this we are going to give the application of 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.170
 mega where only one emotion to 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.610
 visual we are going to accept so that we 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.560
 speaks directly the application of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.030
 we're going to go the title and the weight 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.420
 of the album we will give you to download 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.620
 or are expected to be downloaded 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.620
 [Music] 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.140
 but that has been downloaded you are going to 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.840
 delete the notification and they will not open 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.760
 nothing directly is when they open the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.429
 notification will go to the winrar 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.429
 [Music] 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.010
 and when they are there they will look for the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.240
 mega folder that comes completely 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.580
 capital letters 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.610
 havana would megatone the search 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.740
 the rar file that was downloaded does not go 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 to click simply go to palomear 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.550
 in a little leonard in the option of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.150
 extract file that is the one that is there 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.740
 above and they will give you accept the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.990
 glued construction that copy to 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.570
 principle in that is where we have to 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.810
 hit it, we're going to hit it and my son is 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.970
 the extraction process is going to start 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.600
 let's wait for it to end so that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.600
 the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 the songs I am completely 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.130
 subtracted and we can hear it 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.400
 almost as you can see it did not take long 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.650
 good also depends a lot these 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.650
 devices and the weight of the air 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.240
 As you can see there , the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.120
 album completely they could not go the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.360
 Favorite product and listen in 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.550
 use cases please I'll go to the option of 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.870
 songs and I'm going to scan the 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.250
 device so that all the songs 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.250
 new can be heard 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.190
 eat and I leave all albums equal 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.389
 that I just discarded that is the new 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.389
 classic of that law 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.110

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.390

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.450
 [Music] 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.220
 He trained well with going back there you know 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.600
 that something was something incomplete 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.950
 I think it's the good deluxe version in 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.190
 all the students that selena is a 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.140
 luxe version and good confused its 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.240
 I discard and I do not reproduce it because of the theme 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.950
 of copying well that 's the other one for 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.020
