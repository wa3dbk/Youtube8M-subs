I'm<00:01:54.979> going<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.159> switch<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:55.579> off<00:01:55.640> we're<00:01:55.850> going

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
I'm going to switch that off we're going

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.429 
I'm going to switch that off we're going
to<00:01:56.000> go<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.149> almost<00:01:56.329> complete<00:01:56.840> darkness<00:01:57.079> and

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
to go to almost complete darkness and

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.499 
to go to almost complete darkness and
then<00:01:57.920> I'm<00:01:58.009> going<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.219> show<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.429> how<00:01:59.240> easily

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
then I'm going to show you how easily

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.060 
then I'm going to show you how easily
this<00:01:59.840> lock-on<00:02:00.409> with<00:02:00.679> a<00:02:00.710> little<00:02:00.950> bit<00:02:01.039> of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
this lock-on with a little bit of

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.120 
this lock-on with a little bit of
infrared<00:02:01.429> light

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.480 

okay<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.650> standing<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:06.770> complete<00:02:07.100> darkness

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
okay so standing in complete darkness

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.100 
okay so standing in complete darkness
and<00:02:09.490> without<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.900> Yamanote<00:02:11.900> ste<00:02:12.739> ii<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:14.110> lens

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and without the Yamanote ste ii on lens

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.530 
and without the Yamanote ste ii on lens
is<00:02:15.290> hunting<00:02:15.709> cannot<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.700> any<00:02:16.940> lock-on

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
is hunting cannot get any lock-on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.710 
is hunting cannot get any lock-on
because<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.050> not<00:02:18.200> enough<00:02:18.470> contrast<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:20.540> just

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
because it's not enough contrast we just

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.530 
because it's not enough contrast we just
power<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.230> ste<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:23.180> what's<00:02:23.420> going

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
power that ste to up then what's going

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.670 
power that ste to up then what's going
to<00:02:23.600> happen<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.380> throw<00:02:24.530> out

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
to happen is it's going to throw out

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.880 
to happen is it's going to throw out
this<00:02:24.800> infrared<00:02:25.220> beam<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.540> without<00:02:27.530> instant

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
this infrared beam and without instant

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.020 
this infrared beam and without instant
lock-on<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.459> again<00:02:29.360> we're<00:02:29.660> not<00:02:29.690> trigger<00:02:30.140> any

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
lock-on and again we're not trigger any

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.740 
lock-on and again we're not trigger any
any<00:02:32.030> flashes<00:02:32.660> here<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.550> were<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.569> can

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
any flashes here but if we were we can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.170 
any flashes here but if we were we can
just<00:02:35.900> get<00:02:36.050> on<00:02:36.140> with<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.319> job<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:36.920> as<00:02:37.220> I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
just get on with the job because as I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.270 
just get on with the job because as I
move<00:02:38.360> around<00:02:38.480> changing<00:02:39.200> focal<00:02:39.590> length<00:02:39.830> from

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
move around changing focal length from

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.050 
move around changing focal length from
min<00:02:40.730> across<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.720> bookshelf<00:02:42.760> across<00:02:43.760> to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
min across to the bookshelf across to

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.340 
min across to the bookshelf across to
the<00:02:44.330> side<00:02:44.569> light<00:02:44.810> over<00:02:45.050> there<00:02:45.170> which<00:02:45.319> is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
the side light over there which is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.650 
the side light over there which is
switched<00:02:45.680> off<00:02:45.830> every<00:02:46.340> time<00:02:46.580> it's<00:02:47.480> a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
switched off every time it's a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.080 
switched off every time it's a
split-second<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.500> lock<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.790> really

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
split-second to lock on so it really

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.229 
split-second to lock on so it really
does<00:02:50.390> make<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.560> much<00:02:52.100> easier<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.700> get<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.000> job

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
does make it much easier to get the job

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.090 
does make it much easier to get the job
done<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:56.230> Helios<00:02:57.230> make<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.650> lot<00:02:57.799> easier<00:02:57.830> to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
done with Helios make it a lot easier to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.620 
done with Helios make it a lot easier to
get<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> job<00:02:58.459> done<00:02:58.610> especially<00:02:58.910> if<00:02:59.420> you're

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
get the job done especially if you're

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.650 
get the job done especially if you're
doing<00:02:59.810> those<00:03:00.110> those<00:03:00.860> shots<00:03:01.250> between<00:03:02.090> the
