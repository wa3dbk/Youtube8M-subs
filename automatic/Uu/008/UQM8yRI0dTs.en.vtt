 as the chancellor Basten hour and the TV 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.119
 If someone told me ten years ago that I would enjoy it more and more 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.110
 Caftan will be presented to people together with the probable but 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.779
 that's just one of the things 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.460
 that can cause hindrance in us and has convinced me as uncritical 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.509
 and without prejudice my children look at my works of art and as well 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.050
 they showed me something else, because it is not the result 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.880
 strangely on the way is the goal nevertheless it can not be 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.200
 Damage if you have some support on the way to the finish 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.739
 and therefore we have for you a new movie with crafting instructions to at 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.370
 Denz in it could, for example, see how a Christmas calendar itself tinker 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 can all this be under FemTV on the subject of the moment he is a bit the one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.920
 Season which is great for crafting one has the one 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 Natural materials on the other hand, it does not have to come out anyway 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.650
 can completely 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.780
 Good tinkering on the 8th 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.360
 it is often not the material where it hooks at least not in the op 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.750
 Jahnerinnen Hill in the 77 she writes namely 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.480
 I have a lot of different paper glue colors just everything 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.680
 possible to tinker but I have no idea what we should tinker you 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.640
 the unit the Rieder son this question Hanau determines our 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.840
 Basten expert Anna Prohaska answers Hello 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.000
 what do you advise to lean 77 yes so the most important thing is that you look ahead 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.750
 Before you get started on Intel, team up with your talent 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.830
 very close Lancaster moment the Christmas and Advent season 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.330
 and that you were in the topic because I do that because it's easy 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.730
 Since I brought today our beautiful cookie jar down this very quickly 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.870
 Easy to tinker around the can to get what the retailer but you can 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.090
 also in a shoebox emol to incentives cardboard box the one at home 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.190
 The whole thing is left with old driver when Marx thinks he is 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.320
 and can the whole still nicely decorated with Plus driving with 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.640
 state with Perl with a bit of glitter 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.470
 you have a pretty good goal 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.800
 instead of a few Kiekser Roncalli super gift for grandma and grandpa 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.829
 nationwide are also made in front of totally fast looks very nice 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.190
 The city then further by Mr. entry 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.489
 There are the ways that you can make the Christmas cards yourself 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.549
 yes that's all there is to do all this alone on site and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.860
 Toddlers you have everything in Cork 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.940
 the jams and the overall nice result Â»says he has winter now 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.200
 Now look in the retailer how can you do it yourself 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.210
 to cut completely different motives from the crown on but also with old ones 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.919
 and then lay the template on paper to make the child paint 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.600
 that's Aral 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.660
 if all this does not have nice effect in the end and then you have internal 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.320
 once again the opportunity to consume the whole spleen ribbon and around 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.050
 for the sports car division demanded beautiful destination is no matter where you are 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.569
 just give up a little already handy 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.439
 and explained a spokeswoman 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.369
 what should you have at home if you want to tinker now and then so 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.559
 you create as a foundation to create 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.939
 As a basis it is very important to choose different colors 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.659
 It does not necessarily have a lot of data to make it important for you to have that 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.339
 Basic colors have the mutually miscible 15 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.879
 and to the departure it was very important very much to pay attention that the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.430
 Scissors of rounded is that the children can not hurt Jan 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.319
 then just in the household Speaking of what I still have everything there or stop 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.769
 go on a trip outside 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.709
 At chestnuts, rar are currently collecting something new from old 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.429
 is currently in custody 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.529
 in the years from the courses for parents 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.969
 now a culprit never so head are not suitable for tinkering 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.939
 Of course there are always meetings but mostly it is not 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.740
 because they can not tinker 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.900
 It assumes that the ideas are missing and I just know just the tip in the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.110
 to choose oneself in the subject with the child are children 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.710
 scary creatively so the best ideas too and simple 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.230
 Getting started together and getting started per cent right is also the way to get started 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.120
 Things at home, perhaps, had a certain foundation for that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.320
 one or the other then Orient in completely different devices a house look at times 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.309
 what finds 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.759
 then you can start directly to tinkering that should 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.399
 Parents still notice her when they are working with the children 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.109
 Vintage important is that rider street parked in front of it 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.239
 that the children do not lose the pleasure of having certain numbers 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.300
 maybe because the kids work one to two hours than the kids 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.370
 Concentration of know-how have lists 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.400
 and around that one has the children also runs free the Julchen 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.460
 You can try different products as well 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.310
 importantly close 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.180
 that was not always saying about year ago and so the whole thing works 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.879
 Sunbeams can and do have wrinkles 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.319
 In the end, it's also fun and then comes the best result contributed 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:42.789
 5 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.509
 Thank you to my friend 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.779
 If you wanted to get creative, I would also learn each one 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.819
 Lots of tips for you, for example, how to make salt dough yourself or 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.629
 Congratulatory cards to make birth yourself can do all this under article 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.300
 then we have embedded this topic in KlÃ¼tz Bastel 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.070
 Eckert and when he clicks on something for Minis and then 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.930
 Natural materials then he has the arguments of the stars is not so 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.169
 heavy 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.389
 to tinker and then at the weir also from as a lot of photos I get 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.770
 had called in the forum to send more photos with all artwork 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.289
 find the artwork of all children 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.470
 so that a lot of photos get sent for example 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.290
 here this for me quite quite great from Leonie last- and draft animals too 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.529
 Mom Simone Ott 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.849
 really designed as a dozen natural materials 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.549
 then one here clearly made to the Muni with the two sons 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.300
 and there is also an artist at work counting three years old 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.449
 and that made a two-year-old son 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.309
 Sabrina thanks for the many letters and if you have more 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.650
 then you can also paint and snip girls 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.339
 persevered or 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.389
 Walsky march richly betrayed in learn here when kids start too 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.029
 To paint customs and not just cephalopods so have fun reading 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.849
 and especially when being creative
