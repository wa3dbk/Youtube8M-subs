 and as always in the second part of our 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 video guide we will test machine six 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.229
 auras 556 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 On the accuracy of shooting we will shoot 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.700
 single and ray redeem standing and on the go with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 different distances below under each 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
 I'll write with a test 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 hit results 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.860
 but 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.379
 and so in front of you you see on 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.739
 precision result label 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.930
 I'd add that the visible trassir on 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.980
 really are not the final point 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 hits so the results on video 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 may differ with the final results 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.220
 hitting a bullet in the target and in the third part 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.370
 we will check what the damage actually is 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.519
