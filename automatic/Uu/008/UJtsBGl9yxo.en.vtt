00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
cocktail and not surprisingly a couple

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.899 
cocktail and not surprisingly a couple
of<00:00:36.260> years<00:00:36.379> ago<00:00:36.559> I<00:00:36.859> was<00:00:36.979> asked<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.460> create<00:00:37.579> a

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
of years ago I was asked to create a

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.329 
of years ago I was asked to create a
pear<00:00:38.179> martini<00:00:38.469> now<00:00:39.469> most<00:00:39.949> people<00:00:40.100> would

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
pear martini now most people would

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.829 
pear martini now most people would
probably<00:00:40.489> reach<00:00:40.819> for<00:00:41.030> some<00:00:41.179> kind<00:00:41.389> of<00:00:41.479> flavored

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
probably reach for some kind of flavored

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.779 
probably reach for some kind of flavored
vodka<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.289> had<00:00:42.440> perronnette<00:00:42.979> and<00:00:43.129> kind<00:00:43.699> of

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
vodka that had perronnette and kind of

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.700 
vodka that had perronnette and kind of
start<00:00:44.059> from<00:00:44.210> there<00:00:44.449> but<00:00:45.019> when<00:00:45.170> someone<00:00:45.530> said

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
start from there but when someone said

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.500 
start from there but when someone said
pear<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.190> me<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.489> first<00:00:46.760> thing<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.030> thought<00:00:47.239> of

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
pear to me the first thing I thought of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.289 
pear to me the first thing I thought of
was<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.440> Glenfiddich<00:00:48.979> 12<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.879> I'm<00:00:50.059> gonna<00:00:50.149> make

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
was the Glenfiddich 12 so I'm gonna make

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.939 
was the Glenfiddich 12 so I'm gonna make
the<00:00:50.449> Scottish<00:00:50.839> pear<00:00:51.139> for<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.710> show<00:00:51.889> you

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
the Scottish pear for you and show you

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.509 
the Scottish pear for you and show you
how<00:00:52.159> this<00:00:52.309> works<00:00:52.519> perfectly<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.019> cocktail

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
how this works perfectly in a cocktail

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.709 
how this works perfectly in a cocktail
starting<00:00:55.519> off<00:00:55.639> then<00:00:55.819> with<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.059> glymphatic<00:00:56.269> 12

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
starting off then with the glymphatic 12

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.029 
starting off then with the glymphatic 12
year<00:00:56.929> old<00:00:57.079> which<00:00:57.319> is<00:00:57.350> probably<00:00:57.799> the<00:00:57.920> most

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
year old which is probably the most

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.459 
year old which is probably the most
mixable<00:00:58.609> of<00:00:58.819> the<00:00:58.999> Glenfiddich<00:00:59.449> range<00:00:59.749> just

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
mixable of the Glenfiddich range just

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.969 
mixable of the Glenfiddich range just
due<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.889> its<00:01:01.010> youth<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.670> 3/4<00:01:02.569> ounce<00:01:02.979> now

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
due to its youth a 3/4 ounce now

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.560 
due to its youth a 3/4 ounce now
cocktails<00:01:04.460> are<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:04.699> about<00:01:04.940> balance<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.540> I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
cocktails are all about balance so I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.790 
cocktails are all about balance so I
didn't<00:01:05.840> want<00:01:05.960> anything<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.440> be<00:01:06.560> too

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
didn't want anything to be too

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.710 
didn't want anything to be too
overpowering<00:01:07.370> so<00:01:07.880> I'm<00:01:07.970> actually<00:01:08.060> gonna<00:01:08.270> split

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
overpowering so I'm actually gonna split

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480 
overpowering so I'm actually gonna split
the<00:01:08.870> base<00:01:09.020> spirit<00:01:09.380> between<00:01:09.620> Glenfiddich<00:01:10.310> and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the base spirit between Glenfiddich and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.820 
the base spirit between Glenfiddich and
Hendricks<00:01:11.210> gin<00:01:11.540> which<00:01:11.870> gives<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.230> nice<00:01:12.380> kind<00:01:12.740> of

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
Hendricks gin which gives a nice kind of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.610 
Hendricks gin which gives a nice kind of
drier<00:01:13.100> more<00:01:13.760> delicate<00:01:14.270> equation<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> base

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
drier more delicate equation to the base

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.960 
drier more delicate equation to the base
spirit<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.730> a<00:01:16.760> 3/4<00:01:17.450> ounce<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.810> Hendricks

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
spirit so a 3/4 ounce of Hendricks

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970 
spirit so a 3/4 ounce of Hendricks
now<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.330> pear<00:01:20.540> has<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.930> be<00:01:21.020> promoted<00:01:21.560> somehow

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
now the pear has to be promoted somehow

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.800 
now the pear has to be promoted somehow

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
like the Glenfiddich 12 so a 1/2 ounce

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.390 
like the Glenfiddich 12 so a 1/2 ounce

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.270 

I'm<00:02:24.049> gonna<00:02:24.170> serve<00:02:24.439> this<00:02:24.650> cocktail<00:02:24.889> on<00:02:25.159> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
I'm gonna serve this cocktail on the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.099 
I'm gonna serve this cocktail on the
stem<00:02:25.609> and<00:02:25.939> I<00:02:25.999> want<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.299> keep<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> texture<00:02:26.900> nice

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
stem and I want to keep the texture nice

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.379 
stem and I want to keep the texture nice
and<00:02:27.379> smooth<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.760> reason<00:02:28.819> I'm<00:02:29.239> going

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
and smooth so for that reason I'm going

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.830 
and smooth so for that reason I'm going
to<00:02:29.450> double<00:02:29.810> strain<00:02:30.879> into<00:02:31.879> my<00:02:32.180> cocktail<00:02:32.629> glass

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
to double strain into my cocktail glass

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.559 
to double strain into my cocktail glass
and<00:02:35.889> use<00:02:36.889> the<00:02:37.069> garnish<00:02:37.430> opportunity<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.329> pull

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
and use the garnish opportunity to pull

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.990 
and use the garnish opportunity to pull
out<00:02:38.719> one<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> those<00:02:39.079> flavors<00:02:39.400> fresh<00:02:40.400> pear<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.969> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
out one of those flavors fresh pear is a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.270 
out one of those flavors fresh pear is a
great<00:02:41.359> option<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.170> spoils<00:02:42.680> very<00:02:42.980> quickly

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
great option but it spoils very quickly

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.849 
great option but it spoils very quickly
just<00:02:43.459> like<00:02:43.760> apple<00:02:44.269> once<00:02:44.480> cut<00:02:44.810> turns<00:02:45.469> brown

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
just like apple once cut turns brown

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.830 
just like apple once cut turns brown
within<00:02:46.280> seconds<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.879> it's<00:02:47.000> probably<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.359> safer

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
within seconds so it's probably a safer

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.989 
within seconds so it's probably a safer
and<00:02:48.019> more<00:02:48.530> presentable<00:02:49.069> option<00:02:49.609> to<00:02:49.760> use

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:49.999 
and more presentable option to use

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.250 
and more presentable option to use
citrus<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.590> I'll<00:02:51.829> cut<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.099> lemon<00:02:52.519> twist

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
citrus so I'll cut a lemon twist

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.309 
citrus so I'll cut a lemon twist
