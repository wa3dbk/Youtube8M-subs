are<00:00:26.099> allergic<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.550> aspirin<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
are allergic to aspirin as it is a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.099 
are allergic to aspirin as it is a
precursor<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.590> aspirin<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:30.060> willow<00:00:30.390> bark<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
precursor to aspirin now willow bark is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.790 
precursor to aspirin now willow bark is
a<00:00:31.199> beta<00:00:31.650> hydroxy<00:00:32.329> derivative<00:00:33.329> acid<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
a beta hydroxy derivative acid that is a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520 
a beta hydroxy derivative acid that is a
larger<00:00:35.340> molecule<00:00:36.000> than<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:36.630> alpha<00:00:36.960> hydroxy

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
larger molecule than an alpha hydroxy

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
larger molecule than an alpha hydroxy
acid<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.309> great<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.790> use<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> congested

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
acid so it's great to use on a congested

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
acid so it's great to use on a congested
poor<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.640> small<00:00:41.910> enough<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
poor because it's small enough to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
poor because it's small enough to
penetrate<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.530> stays<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> surface

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
penetrate but also stays on the surface

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.900 
penetrate but also stays on the surface
to<00:00:45.210> help<00:00:45.390> eat<00:00:45.629> away<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.320> dead<00:00:46.620> protein<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to help eat away at that dead protein so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.639 
to help eat away at that dead protein so
