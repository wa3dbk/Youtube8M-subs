00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here are the RPM

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.001
and exhaust temp.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.002
Very simple.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.003
Amperage and battery voltage are here.

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:49.004
Nothing complicated.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.005
Begging the firing procedure.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.006
Fuel is ON.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.007
Fuel valve to ON.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:52.008
POWER :)

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.009
It makes quite a lot of noise

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.010
Intake generates high frequencies

00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:42.011
and the GTD-350 has intake outside

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:45.012
so its silenced a bit more

00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:49.013
closing the fuel valve

00:04:51.014 --> 00:04:56.014
You should see now excess fuel from drain system
