00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.850
 in that susie story of how songs change from that third 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.269
 for that first 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.239
 db but mosley copied the disk 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.439
 of what tejero 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 jalisco themes like yesterday 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.279
 all disk files to be honest 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.919
 the copious 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.199
 we told 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.310
 to the page 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.259
 discourteous and I drive 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.210
 we can not enter at least expensive 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.880
 can can enter must be registered 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.790
 not having registered 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.270
 but he pulled his masters quoted by making these options 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.240
 how can you fall by song your artist 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.980
 hobaugh charles towers 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.240
 in that case qe3 that court 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.720
 we search 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.870
 they will not look like 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.500
 three authors who have uploaded the same song 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.990
 now in difficulty 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.880
 marked with color 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.260
 the x what is this these 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.390
 If I had everything marked 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.989
 with colorful designs 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.440
 is that 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.900
 in all the cinemas 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.140
 as you can see 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 there are two equal lines 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.210
 means 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.720
 that if this one is checked 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 and that too 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 proactive watertight 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010
 I'm interested in being 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.640
 we create tons 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.110
 pd jasper will download the audio 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.310
 date 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.270
 to get mp3 we give who you take away 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 each shows the songs that upload them neighborhood 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.180
 they are just uploaded all 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.710
 the one that interests us esplÃ¡ of 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 of the impact 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.030
 It is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 as you can see up to the midi the mp3 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 and here is milan 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.049
 we load them 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.330
 to be eternal problems are going to look for long term 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.400
 as expected 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 we are not araque third this 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.850
 we open it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 if the first time they work I do not know for that great cross escape 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.409
 so that they know they appear we are going to fail to adhere 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.259
 I took copy 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.259
 the files of the disk of which tejero 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.759
 in the folder yesterday 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.919
 in fact he commented 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.269
 the thickness that interests them we select April 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.069
 they will appear 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.399
 these aspects 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 now the one that interests us is the hawks 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.549
 that shows us 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 the songs take away gerardus 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 choose this 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.789
 as you will see here it shows 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:50.650
 I'm fed up 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.650
 or the boots says the song 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.350
 here the volume 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.439
 and today this 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.809
 we deployed to that the kpc of gernika 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.150
 we see these guys what we are interested in, they are going to be 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.109
 the middle point what point of Jesus 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.040
 the limit point can be can be mythical point points charter 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.300
 the notes 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.999
 the point of gs 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.029
 just being able to stand 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.769
 np tasks 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.839
 to replace it as we select right click 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.489
 to import 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.659
 the bus camus the puddle the mined stadnik 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.059
 we open 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.879
 as you can see 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.729
 simply regarding a shock 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.359
 and it happened 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.299
 as you can see stark the song char notes of the impact 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.059
 replace 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.469
 the song 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.469
 we select pgs that there is right to export 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.839
 you do not know warm up now in this box we give right click to adhere 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.869
 it's like the song the first time 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.559
 in these memories 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.029
 I will always be a left soldier 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.149
 0 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:07.159
 on that side make use of what to do 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.159
 in fact 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.219
 now 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.629
 we give him hockey 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.479
 we hope the pass 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.129
 to 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.439
 if we modify the elective not 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.120
 the heat 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.979
 when the song comes in or afterwards from there it can be modified 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 with this term 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830
 ramos has kpk to visualize the song the chart 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.930
 sta 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.930
 of incorrect masters and for having 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.559
 as you can see 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.999
 no obstane will change what it does 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.150
 I have been fine 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.409
 this 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.610
 balanced 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.610
 simply because as you can see 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.729
 it's so complicated 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.050
 the only thing that is 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.719
 It is slow 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.719
 when replacing the point measure point bgc 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.710
 this
