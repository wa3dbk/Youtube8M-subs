00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
construction as you can see there's only

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.270 
construction as you can see there's only
one<00:02:34.920> tension<00:02:35.340> bar<00:02:36.170> which<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.379> i<00:02:37.620> believe<00:02:38.159> is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
one tension bar which I i believe is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.390 
one tension bar which I i believe is
stainless<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.480> FRN<00:02:43.079> handled<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.249> it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
stainless and the FRN handled so it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.479 
stainless and the FRN handled so it's
really<00:02:44.579> lightweight<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:46.260> weights<00:02:46.560> less<00:02:47.189> than

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
really lightweight it weights less than

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.899 
really lightweight it weights less than
2<00:02:47.969> ounces<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.650> 1.9<00:02:51.680> from<00:02:52.909> their

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
2 ounces I think it's 1.9 from their

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.550 
2 ounces I think it's 1.9 from their
website<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.799> design<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.519> really<00:02:56.939> comfortable

to cut outs here one and until this Kara

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.710 
to cut outs here one and until this Kara
is<00:03:13.859> good<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.560> since<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.799> not<00:03:17.129> logging<00:03:17.720> when

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
is good so since it's not logging when

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.990 
is good so since it's not logging when
you<00:03:18.870> stab<00:03:19.319> something<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.979> it<00:03:20.099> falls<00:03:20.400> off<00:03:20.669> it

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
you stab something and it falls off it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300 
you stab something and it falls off it
will<00:03:21.090> fall<00:03:21.389> fall<00:03:21.780> off<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.199> your<00:03:22.349> finger<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.949> it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
will fall fall off on your finger and it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.789 
will fall fall off on your finger and it
will<00:03:23.400> not<00:03:23.549> cut<00:03:23.759> you<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.239> mean<00:03:25.079> if<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.259> grab<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
will not cut you I mean if you grab it

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.420 
will not cut you I mean if you grab it
like<00:03:25.979> on<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> back<00:03:26.849> when<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> close<00:03:28.109> this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
like on the back when you close this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.629 
like on the back when you close this
well<00:03:29.509> in<00:03:30.509> my<00:03:30.720> cut<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.049> but<00:03:31.199> still<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.799> know<00:03:31.919> it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
well in my cut you but still you know it

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.390

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
believe that that's the best way to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.729 
believe that that's the best way to
handle<00:03:37.919> this<00:03:38.220> knife<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:39.540> small<00:03:39.870> tasks<00:03:40.319> like

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
handle this knife for small tasks like

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.569 
handle this knife for small tasks like
opening<00:03:41.220> boxes<00:03:41.579> or<00:03:41.909> letters<00:03:42.509> or<00:03:42.889> maybe<00:03:43.889> I

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
opening boxes or letters or maybe I

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.179 
opening boxes or letters or maybe I
don't<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.419> a<00:03:45.449> carbon<00:03:46.489> or<00:03:47.629> opening<00:03:48.629> tapes

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
don't know do a carbon or opening tapes

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:57.349 
don't know do a carbon or opening tapes
cutting<00:03:50.189> threats<00:03:51.060> or<00:03:52.909> thin<00:03:53.909> rub<00:03:54.299> probes<00:03:56.359> it's

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
cutting threats or thin rub probes it's

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.649 
cutting threats or thin rub probes it's
not<00:03:57.599> good<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.989> handle<00:03:58.500> really<00:03:59.250> a<00:04:00.739> harder<00:04:01.739> tasks

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
not good to handle really a harder tasks

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.670 
not good to handle really a harder tasks
because<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.870> construction<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
because of the construction and the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.179 
because of the construction and the
blades<00:04:05.250> pretty<00:04:05.790> thing<00:04:06.269> also<00:04:06.479> and<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.680> tip<00:04:07.949> is

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
pretty thing also as you can see okay

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.479 
pretty thing also as you can see okay
the<00:04:12.419> good<00:04:12.599> thing<00:04:12.629> about<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.199> one<00:04:13.469> is<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.769> ah

the good thing about this one is that ah
it's<00:04:15.769> almost<00:04:16.820> if<00:04:17.820> not<00:04:18.359> legal<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.469> carry

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
it's almost if not legal to carry

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.060 
it's almost if not legal to carry
everywhere<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:21.690> if<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.079> guys<00:04:22.320> are<00:04:22.560> troubling

going into places where knife law is a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.990 
going into places where knife law is a
little<00:04:29.150> bit<00:04:29.270> more<00:04:29.480> strict<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:31.520> might<00:04:31.820> be<00:04:31.970> a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
little bit more strict this might be a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.840 
little bit more strict this might be a
good<00:04:32.210> option<00:04:32.450> or<00:04:33.290> at<00:04:33.560> least<00:04:33.890> will<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.580> knife

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
good option or at least will be a knife

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
questions the construction is pretty
