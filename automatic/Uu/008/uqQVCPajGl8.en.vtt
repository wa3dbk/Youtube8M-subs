00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.749 
row by applying the same logic to the
second<00:02:07.930> row<00:02:08.049> we<00:02:08.590> recognize<00:02:09.129> that<00:02:09.159> the<00:02:09.549> black

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
second row we recognize that the black

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.390 
second row we recognize that the black
hexagon<00:02:10.360> must<00:02:10.810> change<00:02:11.170> into<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> white<00:02:11.860> hexagon

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
hexagon must change into a white hexagon

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.559 
hexagon must change into a white hexagon
therefore<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.540> correct<00:02:13.870> answer

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
therefore the correct answer

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.059
