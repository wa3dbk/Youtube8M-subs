00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hey people here and we come to one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.230
 further sequences are formed by rohde reith 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.400
 is now close to the door that works 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.629
 now on the 18th 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.560
 I think and the first video will be 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.599
 already taken in from now on 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 small outcry and it was 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.490
 videos were forbidden to three or 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 varonis were banned and wales became 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 was banned lukas the rapper is allowed 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 apparently still make videos but 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.050
 otherwise no one is allowed to make videos where 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.010
 he uses the video contacts and before 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.570
 I now say so 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 I would like to clarify something else 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.080
 i think waro is a very cool one 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 Project has a lot of potential, too 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 it does not fully exploit the potential 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.579
 in my opinion but it has a lot 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 potential so the participants are cool too 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 Great sharing is a project that I do 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.739
 also like to watch but now we come 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.809
 it is not the main point 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 possible to learn everything 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 it is not possible to watch everything 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.200
 so it is now that for was o 3 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 from the whole youtube so from kern 90 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.510
 percent of youtuber unevenly 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.180
 was agreed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 that yes the video does not work 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 may be used by the barroso 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 there is no all death videos are none 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.690
 news and that are of course the factor 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 that there is no news about it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.589
 it is now does not have the time at 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 day is for success one would have 60 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 watching videos that would be me 50th 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 hours video material what is the be 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 has to look at everything 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.030
 and that's how cool I am 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.590
 the goods news to were two and was 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.299
 Once upon a time, it was a pleasure to see it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 namely an advantage if you do not have the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.830
 time has not been headed by anyone and over 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.750
 to watch the meadow but still 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 would like to be informed of what's going on in 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 Faro completely then it was extremely good me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.150
 always have it that way with mine 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 34 darling has looked and otherwise hold 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.659
 they were just about to understand what 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 do the rest and that is now 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 in faro three just banned that whatever 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.150
 The reason is, of course, that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 nothing should be saved 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.439
 and I can partly understand that 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 but actually if you think so 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.240
 then they always have to ban 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 with quasi if I kick now ok follow 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.579
 a piece of xy 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.920
 then we would have to theoretically 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.600
 ban about to occur ie 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.430
 I could not help and I times 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 my colleagues when we talk about why 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.310
 do not write describe what 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.990
 shall we talk about it you want 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.509
 know who died is yes then says 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.070
 I can not say but describe 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.750
 banned so now the question is likely 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.459
 in theory then I was a lot 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.080
 if I do not do the artwork 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.819
 use because actually already then do 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.430
 I'll take a picture myself and you 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.840
 yes, here he died but sees 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.340
 connoisseurs see because I'm all wollny dead 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.500
 My marx is just cheap 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.849
 is excuse and that something has lazy 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 or what it is like that and I still want to 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.120
 times before him that I was extremely skid 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.890
 that the motives are extremely cool 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.209
 that 's the way it is with us 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.280
 Monthly is just an excuse and it 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.439
 The point is that these were 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.540
 These all death videos extremely the clicks 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.739
 pull away from the baron video stuck 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.659
 People are working a lot on the videos 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.909
 example, bridges and so on what the 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.189
 then bring in indexing 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.900
 almost the videos stolen and someone 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.340
 another gets just a few of those 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.079
 clicks at years of me but also 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.209
 the over the clicks get it for the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.349
 videos no question but then you should 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.819
 in my opinion, so well 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.230
 define that it's actually more of a 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.209
 the topic is that the ware news the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 clicks we steal and of course one 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.169
 run away a few takings and that is 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.639
 just not the spoiler related 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.780
 so what, how can you do that 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.700
 Of course you could say that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 somehow a Varonis while making at 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.989
 the use no picture material but 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.129
 the reports about it and then links 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.069
 in the video description to 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.280
 artwork but that's so awkward 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.510
 So, really, that's what I am 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.189
 actually in general opinion that was 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.750
 could be substantially smaller again 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.280
 and what big raises me is a pity 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.659
 really that these too all die 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.040
 videos and so that's forbidden 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.780
 I liked to watch it and I think so 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.310
 that has also expanded the project because 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.409
 it's okay 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.639
 the project is bigger than here now 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.919
 these videos violate the project 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.530
 happened and, among other things, I've already 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.209
 Lukas the rapper is still explaining 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.099
 example of the run got videos about it 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.030
 to be allowed to do 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.159
 why the on the video material 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.599
 use and others not that is mine 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.680
 opinion for a clear double standard 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.949
 and actually does not do any 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.599
 sense 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.030
 it is allowed that we celebrate the people so 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.459
 rather celebrate yourself the videos where the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.259
 There are songs in it and they do not steal 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.120
 be active the clicks okay that can be done 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.229
 but do not make the others and that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.639
 I think for example is such a 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.220
 small double standards with which I do not 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.900
 quite frankly come and me 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.370
 I want to raise again because I know 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.019
 that people can not settle 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.639
 It was a cool project, I'm glad 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.709
 also that without it is if the consequence 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.939
 1 survived and people write mine 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.629
 Comments on how you like it 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.310
 your opinion 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.870
 It's cool for you that all die 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.479
 videos and so on were banned 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.070
 you have thus turned to a problem 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.299
 comments are extremely important white again 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.250
 liked which of these two videos 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.599
 Generally, that's easier 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.799
 although I think I assume that 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.419
 the again extremely much of the plant 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.969
 because that's just because it's just one 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.830
 critical view of the things is and 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:29.110
 is usually not so good 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.360
 Theoretically yes made the say yes the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.860
 was cool when we say boah cool though 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.759
 I think I can also my opinion 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.960
 tell the video 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.550
 I mean that my video why should I 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.930
 do not think so 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.849
 Do you have a different opinion about it 11 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.780
 write your opinions and comments 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.889
 then maybe we'll discuss one 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.389
 bit and watch and but 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.039
 next us people if you are my last 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.439
 you want to see video then you click 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.270
 now here somewhere 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:53.500
 below and then it goes to the participants 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.370
 we can join in and nothing else like 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.370
 the people until then
