00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.449
 the other one up 

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.300
 I knew that if you could do it 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.020
 Adventure full of power so percent Riemer 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.569
 of course we have problems with the done 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.179
 I myself not so bad 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.380
 Rosalia cycles in startlingly busy 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 Aids here will be nearly 30 million Chinese is incredible 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 and pretty much have everything we wanted 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 good eleven always go on here 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 I'm really curious what's coming now 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.690
 because cutscene percent 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.530
 maybe it was 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.310
 which is normal 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 Winnenden 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 thinks that's overdone 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.030
 I was 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 18 24 o'clock have fun there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.270
 penultimate mission already approx 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.000
 Sener happens 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 the kid was 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.190
 No 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.410
 Vienna 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.770
 59 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 Hamilton 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 it's raining 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 i know is that the involved clubs and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 many holders 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 there is 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
 both should be the brands of the 9 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.069
 Carnival Corp. 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.499
 it's enough 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.499
 Bayern Munich he was dead 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.419
 Miller 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.489
 is missing 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.869
 I believe so 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.869
 that they can be seen in one piece 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.069
 4 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.069
 we mean the duel 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 I have a present for you 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.279
 the customer has 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.279
 it is coming now 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.349
 the theater fact 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.579
 complete 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.049
 all parts to one 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.109
 to change it 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.489
 not everything muses as we imagine 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.169
 while others are not 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.829
 the Russians close it to leave her internally that will not at all 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.669
 was possible 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.869
 if only I had to rely on it 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.149
 abandoned long ago 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.019
 we are standing on the threshold 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.489
 Women have always managed "If we stick together 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.489
 so be brave now even another try of the Bulgarians 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.060
 I've never seen such an action as it has because on average it's so good 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.190
 Accordingly, the key should be around no exact numbers 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.189
 Mr. Rolf 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.889
 Brussels 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.889
 Disadvantages after 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.449
 Dr 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.439
 by a 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 I 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.089
 Sir 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.089
 dollar 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.089
 hope 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.999
 I believe the life of our side 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 for the honor point 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.199
 so is from 17 years 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.870
 I have to say until the end, all this is something never to do now 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.580
 I am giving them now 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.629
 Percent live bets call what's in the news 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.319
 s 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.499
 I do not want a single one 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.289
 I think he's heading for the stock market hospital here 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.830
 not an isolated case Attention all say 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.150
 from small on 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.789
 he just turns up he was wearing socks allegedly easier 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.419
 Sofia requests to have had with us we wish you 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.499
 all good Berlin I hope that I can quickly get back on my feet 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 in the practical part I became parts of the corpses 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.520
 A dealer 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.930
 That's how it should be 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.190
 so it should be the sea, the sea much better for itself 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.319
 Football is clear that must write us off 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.900
 the feet 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.479
 Add 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.479
 but now that it is composed 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.629
 "That's not scary 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.400
 Dusseldorf 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.809
 look at that 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.889
 it's almost like I'm dying 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.469
 many are exactly it is different than my opinion 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.469
 Right now this thing says the most important weapon in the world 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.560
 and we are used to them i just wanted to cross over to each other 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.550
 stand-in 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.960
 at our luck 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.960
 Travelers also had to succeed in the future 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.259
 one condemns 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.629
 We are not in a bad science fiction movie here 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.629
 Although he we are not here in a bad science fiction movie 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.749
 Raft second signal 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.749
 You can do a lot worse 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.459
 "We'll put everything back to the queen of the usual pomp 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.029
 Gerald immensely that maybe I even gave it 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.839
 so one thing clearly shown 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.599
 Ben Gurion right said this Stork I got him back to a human 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:55.369
 can make 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.389
 then I bring her here 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.099
 That's what we imagine 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:00.979
 there is for me 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.300
 and I know you want to believe that she can be saved 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.300
 but after everything she has done 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:13.830
 the second chance 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.830
 which is my decision 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.159
 Well 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.919
 strictly speaking 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.069
 where much 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.069
 because only when I put them in as meaningful in person 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.409
 but i have seen her her life for men is her vision of 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:29.580
 normal circumstances 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.110
 bring this route 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.110
 the repair is the one that earns a lot, "RÃ¼ttgers said 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:37.409
 Niessl him is still about freedom for the people 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:40.270
 Reports of a battle with a fine 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.680
 that Heinz Fischer is since old 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.479
 the freight France 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.490
 It is an honor to fight by her side 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.360
 he is very different from Klopp 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.159
 through the oil spill on my side 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.969
 Wulff paid tribute to her 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:59.919
 For fans it is not always that everything is full 

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.749
 Uzbek together 

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:06.019
 and the environment and then headfirst into the very last butcher 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.639
 Fallersleben and I'm pretty curious how the whole of them 

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.029
 Herds is 

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:15.919
 and yes I hope the mission will please and we will see its next part 

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.379
