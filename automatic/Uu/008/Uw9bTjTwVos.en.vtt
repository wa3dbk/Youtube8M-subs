greetings stay in the know with dr. now
today<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> discuss<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.940> theory<00:00:06.330> of

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
today I'm going to discuss the theory of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.780 
today I'm going to discuss the theory of
evolution<00:00:06.830> but<00:00:07.830> before<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.220> get<00:00:08.490> into<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
evolution but before we get into the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
evolution but before we get into the
meat<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.030> evolution<00:00:09.690> let's<00:00:10.290> discuss<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
meat of evolution let's discuss what I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.459 
meat of evolution let's discuss what I
mean<00:00:11.219> when<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> say<00:00:11.790> theory<00:00:12.389> there<00:00:13.259> are

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
mean when I say theory there are

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
mean when I say theory there are
generally<00:00:14.040> two<00:00:14.070> definitions<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> word
