the lego insight or train at the 132
these<00:03:19.859> are<00:03:19.980> only<00:03:20.130> sets<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.700> those<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.690> only

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
these are only sets that those the only

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.410 
these are only sets that those the only
set<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.100> came<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.459> those<00:03:23.640> two<00:03:23.850> sets<00:03:24.090> there

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
set it came in those two sets there

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.180 
set it came in those two sets there
which<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.140> same<00:03:25.350> set<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.829> different

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
which is same set just different

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.690 
which is same set just different
production<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:28.160> since<00:03:29.160> these<00:03:29.310> over<00:03:29.549> there<00:03:29.670> I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
production and since these over there I

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.280 
production and since these over there I
guess<00:03:29.910> he<00:03:30.060> had<00:03:30.180> access<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.959> some<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
guess he had access to some of the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.690 
guess he had access to some of the
extras<00:03:31.590> i<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:31.890> some<00:03:32.100> people<00:03:32.370> were<00:03:32.430> able<00:03:32.640> to
