00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello in this new dr video of 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.799
 mac 59 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.290
 i introduced you the fcx colts 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.130
 so it's a car that I found 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.680
 in fact I had to fix us that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.869
 finally repaired are not calling it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 do I buy a piece it takes 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 especially that I buy from the rocket 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 heaven here we can see that she is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 pasted passes made equity and I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 not yet time to go to the store for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.620
 buy the piece we also see that he 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 missing a quarter of an hour ahead so in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.110
 it's here in four-wheel drive 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 we see well behind so it's the fcx 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 so sticks for those who do not know 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.050
 she is in an 18th so it's a small 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.079
 model that is almost in the hand 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 his engine the c1 three hundred and seventy 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.160
 so yes it happens to us pushed him 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.879
 up to 35 km 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 this car with a phone we put 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.070
 a speedometer had written 35 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 km hour 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.020
 the battery so this one she is a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.720
 enemy and match it's a 2007 100 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.330
 million terror in tamia connectivity 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.570
 min so it's not a normal size 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.729
 and at the mini the big peculiarity of this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 model also is that there so what 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.250
 case there here there are three tips in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.619
 same time there is the receiver the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.689
 speed variator for the motor and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.799
 the brain that we see no missile 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.810
 it's the white thing that does all this 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.439
 at the same time the remote control 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 jesse is exactly the same as the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.040
 two that I have in thermal 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.409
 if we look good it's the same thing 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.010
 except that it is not the model mark 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 kraft is nothing written but good 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.270
 would be strongly that are and we 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.610
 would say because the steering wheel for 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.810
 turn is the same except one in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.620
 blue they also changed the antenna they 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.510
 have cut a little 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.420
 so it's a lot more practical a 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.090
 like that it can be a bit ripped off 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.040
 can do a lot of stuff that is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.990
 which is a little rotten with this kind 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.470
 is that I do not know if he has 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.770
 for your changed I think we had 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 did a test and it was 100 m after he 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.060
 started messing around there are also all 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.120
 Maya settings the trim to adjust the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.400
 direction there for thermal function this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.530
 would be idle here it's the same 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.680
 except in electric and that's the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.840
 compensation of direction then 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.090
 the andre man two switches reverse 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.070
 so to change the brains the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.880
 the tons switch so the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.840
 red flashers 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.140
 so that means you have to change 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.540
 normally the batteries but good for the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.880
 test it will be enough so it's life six 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.830
 this is a model that I appreciate 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:13.140
 still in electric so 35 km 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.730
 hour thoroughly at 35 or the all terrain there 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.250
 should the pebbles she does not like too much 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.610
 she jumps a little but on the ground that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.260
 it works nickel 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.820
 so I tell you next time and we're going 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.440
 go to tests in another video 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.440
 thank you and see you next video
