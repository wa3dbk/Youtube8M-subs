00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
for the UV light and then here's a hang

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
for the UV light and then here's a hang
on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.380> filter<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.450> here's<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> UV

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
on the back filter here here's the UV

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990

light itself and this chamber here and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.530 
light itself and this chamber here and
it<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.810> its<00:01:16.020> own<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.560> pump<00:01:17.540> so
