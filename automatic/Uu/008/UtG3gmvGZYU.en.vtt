that scouting pro but now moving into
generals<00:01:39.600> base<00:01:39.869> we're<00:01:40.619> doing<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:40.979> bit

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
generals base we're doing a little bit

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.140 
generals base we're doing a little bit
of<00:01:41.159> her<00:01:41.250> ass<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of her ass and as we can see that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.639 
of her ass and as we can see that
refinery<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> coming<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.380> everything

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
refinery is coming up so everything

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.910 
refinery is coming up so everything
looking<00:01:43.950> very<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.520> normal<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.180> him<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
looking very very normal from him and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
looking very very normal from him and
actually<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.369> saw<00:01:47.549> general<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.119> pull

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
actually we saw general they are pull

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
actually we saw general they are pull
the<00:01:48.659> guy<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> production<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.430> bring

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the guy off of production and then bring

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
the guy off of production and then bring
them<00:01:50.759> back<00:01:50.820> through<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> SCV

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
them back through just to make the SCV

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
them back through just to make the SCV
who<00:01:53.280> pull<00:01:53.549> through<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.240> direction

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
who pull through to that other direction

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.940 
who pull through to that other direction
that's<00:01:55.020> something<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.829> you're

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that's something you can do if you're

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
that's something you can do if you're
dealing<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.219> harasses<00:01:56.820> grab<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> unit<00:01:58.200> hit

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
dealing with harasses grab that unit hit

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010 
dealing with harasses grab that unit hit
T<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.890> stop<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> building<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.600> can

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
T to stop a building and then can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
T to stop a building and then can
right-click<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> building<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.219> continue

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
right-click on the building and continue

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.800 
right-click on the building and continue
building<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.090> should<00:02:03.329> move<00:02:03.600> him

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
building and that should move him

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
building and that should move him
through<00:02:04.200> most<00:02:04.560> times<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.790> what<00:02:06.000> will

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
through most times that's what will

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.130 
through most times that's what will
happen<00:02:06.420> he'll<00:02:06.750> move<00:02:06.960> straight<00:02:07.229> through<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
happen he'll move straight through and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.139 
happen he'll move straight through and
you<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.440> avoid<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:09.130> proper<00:02:09.610> ass<00:02:09.759> as<00:02:10.119> a

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
you can avoid that proper ass as a

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.520 
you can avoid that proper ass as a
result<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.750> that's<00:02:10.869> exactly<00:02:11.020> what<00:02:11.319> we<00:02:11.380> saw

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
result and that's exactly what we saw

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.830 
result and that's exactly what we saw
there<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.860> very<00:02:12.040> nice<00:02:12.220> play<00:02:12.970> there<00:02:13.180> by<00:02:13.209> general

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
there so very nice play there by general

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.360 
there so very nice play there by general
full<00:02:14.020> saturation<00:02:14.200> now<00:02:14.650> coming<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.220> that
