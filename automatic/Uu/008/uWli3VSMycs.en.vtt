00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.050
 so the bourgeoisie that's all the circuit where there surely 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.240
 yesterday afternoon 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.259
 so she is then we will you 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 a watch and a small country 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.999
 which is simple enough for the bcc 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.799
 without further drawing 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.279
 it shows that tickets in prison 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.050
 so took my child 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.569
 police station 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.499
 a city on a subject still handed 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.460
 if for you 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.519
 so that's not how it works 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.519
 so you can not help me, I won the permissions 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 what drives me constantly 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.470
 let's sleep during this time 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.530
 bombenger permission for function 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.960
 silence 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 it allows to delegate define an empty slot 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 why a whole world 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.180
 to relieve on his hips full of jaycee for example 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 this concept 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.850
 it saves a location to definitely condemn 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.640
 and I will show you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.720
 here is finally a list 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 guest of choice 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.650
 he is in prison 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 so what in prison can you do 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.370
 j 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 for a little all this was the general 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.800
 but who did not even attend 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 I arrive there 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.460
 and here he was judged 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 in the prime minister consuming less 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.920

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.689

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.309
 he took you over but a single and who was in peak for a match 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:53.849
 more 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.449
 also if you had permission 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.639
 for some as on a simple jova 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.359
 or to certain groups 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.579
 so I'll get that from a description of the video here 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.529
 so does it make you christmas 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.529
 you do not save 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.359
 so you do not slip on your desk 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.179
 or if and if you had 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.609
 mach in party 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.609
 save as 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.129
 for 100 m 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.199
 well it's all for one 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.269
 q 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.040
 now open hours 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 your mind I almost signed after the earthquake 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 an excellent choice state 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.299
 boumediene 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 but kraft serious type the guide 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.899
 unfortunately we will simply slip without further details 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.269
 either in the top screen or in the bottom screen 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.839
 as it is in point lighthouse 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.969
 company records in the top screen 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.969
 so here we are left 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.409
 given the file successfully displayed 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.729
 you have on your host 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.219
 taste could dread servers 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.429
 and percent and so by strides no 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.650
 the right of 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.650
 Syrian troops after with permission fresco 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 so it was pinocchio 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.029
 a little tour 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.229
 the command put the most dynamic that allies 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.389
 small socrates
