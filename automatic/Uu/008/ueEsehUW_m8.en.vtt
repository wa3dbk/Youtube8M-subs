00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.110
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.520
 decree we are in a new news and 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.340
 The first thing I have to say is that 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.059
 when the river sounds water it carries and it is that 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.240
 good spoken and nintendo has spoken for 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.730
 say it is not aware of what 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.710
 I will comment below and that is 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.669
 a group of hackers a team called 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.869
 team we have deciphered and good according to 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.869
 has said in a statement that it has 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 deciphered the will you code and that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.109
 the hacked in all its glory according to 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.030
 this statement have made it clear that they have 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.730
 deciphered the system's reader 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.440
 files and everything necessary to be able 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.150
 load backups 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.290
 Edwin 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.180
 so that this team is a total success 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.580
 I have to say that good because he enjoys 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.250
 fairly good reputation and it's a new 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.370
 product will be called wiki and an emulator 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.590
 of willy reader that will allow the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.560
 security charges through a 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.890
 External USB device on the other hand 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.500
 nintendo does not boast that your console 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.410
 has been hacked and according to the company and 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.390
 I quote verbatim says the following 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.100
 we are as we are aware that a 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.229
 group of hackers claims to have 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.270
 committed to the security of wiiu without 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.000
 However, we do not have reports that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.830
 confirm this information , neither of 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.750
 that you can load copies or 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 illegal applications in the system 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.940
 nintendo continuously monitors all 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.640
 the security threats of their 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.890
 products and we will use technology and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.540
 we will take the necessary legal measures 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 to prevent piracy 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.380
 that is, this group of hackers has 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.850
 announced news in the next 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 dates 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.350
 and good 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 the truth is that nintendo then now 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.299
 are as same as an earthquake this 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.450
 It has fallen like a jug of cold water in 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.600
 those in the nintendo company and now 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.090
 it will be trying to figure out because 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.820
 what is really happening so 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.820
 well let's hope that this honestly 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.130
 under my point of view it does not happen or be 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.170
 that can not be hacked though strong 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.060
 you know how the subject is but 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 honestly and if you ask me tight 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.989
 you would like them to pirate 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.880
 I honestly would not like that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.100
 could you really hack me 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.130
 I wish you could pirate any 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 console is actually current generation 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.950
 and none of my consoles has fallen in 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.720
 no one's hands to be modified anymore 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.160
 I have the consoles completely 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.680
 intact from the first day that the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.040
 I bought I always preferred to have a 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.410
 perfectly legal console to say it 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.790
 somehow and since if what 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.640
 had what they would have to do is 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.530
 after trying to lower the cost of 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 the games not for what to try not 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.680
 get more attention but good and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.379
 exists in the import pages 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.810
 so that in some way that's a 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.209
 part is not another video but 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.489
 that in some way because this influences 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.109
 also in the pockets and there in those 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.359
 pages you can buy the games a lot 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.359
 cheaper and not resort to piracy 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.069
 that is my opinion and good we see ourselves in 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.340
 the next one a hug to all and up 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.340
 the next
