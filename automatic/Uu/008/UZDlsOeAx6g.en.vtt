00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
really go into their thoughts the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340 
really go into their thoughts the
intimacy<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.730> man<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.239> softness<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
intimacy of a man a softness and a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
intimacy of a man a softness and a
strength<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.430> crow<00:00:53.670> dgo<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.300> like

strength and I think a crow dgo is like
the<00:00:54.600> perfect<00:00:54.949> icon

the perfect icon

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.520 
the perfect icon
it's<00:00:56.750> masculinity<00:00:57.750> without<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's masculinity without kind of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's masculinity without kind of
aggression<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.520> strength<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.390> comes

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
aggression a strength that just comes

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
aggression a strength that just comes
from<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:01.140> confidence<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.039> freedom<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.760> spirit

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
from a confidence of freedom of spirit
