home now the city's divided into four
quadrants

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
quadrants

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.060 
quadrants
you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> northwest<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> southwest

that's actually the center where all the
four<00:00:24.119> quadrants<00:00:24.660> meet<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.320> okay<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:25.949> here's<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
four quadrants meet up okay so here's a

Michigan<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.350> whole<00:00:34.649> system<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
Michigan this whole system is going to

and I was saying our show is all about

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.280 
and I was saying our show is all about
the<00:00:39.030> Benjamins<00:00:39.210> we're<00:00:39.570> gonna<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> rain

the Benjamins we're gonna make it rain

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.069 
the Benjamins we're gonna make it rain
in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.370> Northeast<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.899> little

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
in the Northeast and here is that little

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
in the Northeast and here is that little
system<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> water<00:00:43.829> vapor<00:00:44.160> imagery<00:00:44.520> now

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
system on the water vapor imagery now

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
system on the water vapor imagery now
let's<00:00:45.180> stick<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.690> real<00:00:45.930> quick<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
let's stick with this real quick I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.720 
let's stick with this real quick I
always<00:00:46.890> say<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> atmosphere<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
always say the atmosphere is like a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
always say the atmosphere is like a
hamburger<00:00:48.120> okay<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.020> live<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> bottom<00:00:49.649> bun

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
hamburger okay we live on the bottom bun

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.439 
hamburger okay we live on the bottom bun
this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> around<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> tomato<00:00:50.700> layer<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> it's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this is around the tomato layer and it's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
this is around the tomato layer and it's
showing<00:00:51.750> us<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> moisture<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.620> pink

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
showing us the moisture so that pink

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.819 
showing us the moisture so that pink
indicates<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.149> moisture<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> jet

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
indicates the moisture and then that jet

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.619 
indicates the moisture and then that jet
stream<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.219> far<00:00:56.399> south<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.120> goes<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
stream as far south as that goes the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
stream as far south as that goes the
cold<00:00:57.870> air<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.289> come<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.789> have

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
cold air can come on in now you can have

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.340 
cold air can come on in now you can have
moisture<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> tomato<00:01:00.840> layer<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
moisture in the tomato layer that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.599 
moisture in the tomato layer that
doesn't<00:01:01.649> necessarily<00:01:01.770> mean<00:01:02.309> you're<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.789 
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
voice<00:01:02.820> you're<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> bottom<00:01:03.480> bun<00:01:03.799> because

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
voice you're at the bottom bun because

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.710 
voice you're at the bottom bun because
it<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> actually<00:01:05.430> evaporate<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.570> going

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it can actually evaporate as it's going

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
it can actually evaporate as it's going
through<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.260> pickles<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> cheese<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
through the pickles and the cheese and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.100 
through the pickles and the cheese and
the<00:01:09.000> burger<00:01:09.360> before<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> gets<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> bottom

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the burger before it gets to the bottom

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870 
the burger before it gets to the bottom
bun<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.670> moisture

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
bun but we actually have that moisture

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
bun but we actually have that moisture
through<00:01:12.299> our<00:01:12.420> entire<00:01:12.750> burger<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.560> there

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
through our entire burger here and there

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.039 
through our entire burger here and there
it<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> hour<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.180> hour<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> see

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it is for you hour by hour you can see

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
it is for you hour by hour you can see
that<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> creep<00:01:17.189> eastbound

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that this is going to creep eastbound

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090 
that this is going to creep eastbound
here<00:01:17.939> eventually<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:19.229> along<00:01:19.560> east<00:01:19.830> coast

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
here eventually get along east coast

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.710 
here eventually get along east coast
into<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> afternoon<00:01:20.820> hours<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.450> then

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
into the afternoon hours and then

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.940 
into the afternoon hours and then
unfortunately<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.320> looks<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.830> the

over Erie stay with me now right here
jet<00:03:02.220> stream<00:03:02.489> dips<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.879> so<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.269> have

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
jet stream dips down so you can have

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.580 
jet stream dips down so you can have
cold<00:03:03.629> air<00:03:03.750> dipping<00:03:04.079> down<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.349> we<00:03:04.409> have<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
cold air dipping down so we have the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.379 
cold air dipping down so we have the
cold<00:03:04.769> air<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.040> place<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.549> then<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.299> this

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
cold air in place and then we have this

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.179 
cold air in place and then we have this
little<00:03:06.569> piece<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.930> energy<00:03:07.319> coming<00:03:07.530> across<00:03:07.919> the

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
little piece of energy coming across the

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.909 
little piece of energy coming across the
pink<00:03:08.459> indicates<00:03:09.030> moisture<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.769> what's

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
pink indicates moisture this is what's

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.159 
pink indicates moisture this is what's
happening<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:12.150> mid<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> upper<00:03:12.599> levels<00:03:13.109> of

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
happening in the mid to upper levels of

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.360 
happening in the mid to upper levels of
the<00:03:13.229> atmosphere<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.949> always<00:03:14.129> say<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the atmosphere I always say the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.800 
the atmosphere I always say the
atmosphere<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.849> like<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.000> hamburger<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.629> this

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
atmosphere is like a hamburger so this

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.930 
atmosphere is like a hamburger so this
is<00:03:15.959> around<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.290> tomato<00:03:16.440> layer<00:03:16.919> we<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.489> that

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
is around the tomato layer we have that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.059 
is around the tomato layer we have that
moisture<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.900> does<00:03:19.139> that<00:03:19.319> moisture<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:19.859> all

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
moisture but does that moisture get all

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.740 
moisture but does that moisture get all
the<00:03:20.220> way<00:03:20.310> down<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.760> bottom<00:03:20.940> bun<00:03:21.389> because

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
the way down to the bottom bun because

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.939 
the way down to the bottom bun because
they<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.019> evaporate<00:03:22.260> as<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.769> goes<00:03:22.919> through

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
they can evaporate as it goes through

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.339 
they can evaporate as it goes through
the<00:03:23.129> pickles<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> onions<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> meat

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
the pickles and the onions and the meat

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.649 
the pickles and the onions and the meat
but<00:03:26.159> it<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.729> actually<00:03:26.970> going<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.389> get<00:03:27.479> to<00:03:27.569> the

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
but it is actually going to get to the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.059 
but it is actually going to get to the
bottom<00:03:27.840> bun<00:03:28.139> today<00:03:28.470> there's<00:03:28.680> no<00:03:28.829> evaporation

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
bottom bun today there's no evaporation
