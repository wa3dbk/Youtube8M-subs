00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.940
 here we go to the shareholders of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 the fence 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 partners in crime 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.420
 then already as against the actions we go to the sword 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.370
 to another 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.820
 clinton the senate does not 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.110

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.820
 and then this one 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.310
 not to face an attack where we are going to approach it they keep it a place that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.730
 that they remember 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.040
 tackling 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 and while they were lowering you can speak in the omc 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.420
 percent disapprove 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.020
 ipc as it passes backups for example you buy or not a new external disk uu 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.980
 or in silicon you divide 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.510
 ana to download the documents the photo returned to music 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.879
 the licensed the keys 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.549
 this this is a program and it has no case that some of that held 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.419
 four medals seven stars when he the most important thing 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.909
 p since it's there we're going to 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.909
 let's open this 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.939
 percent videos we keep 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.299
 what are we going to do the little program 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.199
 we execute it 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.729
 and this 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.939
 Perez Pza 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.979
 that we serve aquino was installing 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.609
 efe 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.709
 the mistakes 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.860
 he sent with the equine documents he asked what 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.959

 i we can not exist among these new processes your program 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.269
 we propose next and next link again here is installing the the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:09.999
 Program 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.769
 what is debates 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.729
 this 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.269
 to cedrún a prisoner 1 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.059
 to put on a rest once one believes there is backup 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.799
 by the way you're just going to put the documents and the photos and then he came back 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.469
 proposes programs such as mexico fish 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:30.549
 like the adobe 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.739
 like fires 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.730
 you have to have 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.519
 the discs now and without alex 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.109
 now to be able to do these this 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.499
 for the programs it is extremely 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.499
 and this is only the acp 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.779
 i 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:46.670
 finished 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.629
 and is that the program is opened 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.989
 after finished street 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 efe now this this promises 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.410
 I ask for music the section to 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.569
 backup 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.929
 to pack 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:03.389
 Ode there in that section 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.159
 this here says that how are you going to call 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.529
 nothing you can put the date 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.009
 but the facts 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.389
 what now we are

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.590
 music 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.180
 because what I do not have 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.330
 music cars and 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.849

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.470
 is damaged to the registry by a down to a trojan 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.529
 maluenda 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.510

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.620
 and already brands had the record that you want you do not understand 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.779
 this is not only going to put 1 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.870
 i put face 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.150
 we propose ocde 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.249
 and this and the email 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.320
 by the way you're using for example the 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.819
 the abl uk 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.339
 I can see that I fell 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.849
 and here he found and that that local side 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.479
 i here you keep all the held it without doubts are rules the mail 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.300
 accounts only jealousy your signature assured 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.900
 the note that something happened to the emails 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.139
 and this and here we're just going to put it still done just by lot 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.230
 and this 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.629
 what you have to accept 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.680
 this 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.699
 a guy happened this year for example 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.610
 sometimes the user has saved their for example has internet explorer 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.979
 the processes and mark it supposed course 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.990
 to the coki the favorites are the ones you like the most and all that 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.990
 ocáriz reported if there was but another 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.310
 sto of course tro prado be another machine seeker that the spokesperson 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.490
 he said there 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.839
 and then eta the next 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.080
 and here I want to see what this 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.099
 if it is an external vs 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.790
 or so what is burning in a green tea 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.879
 this plan must be correct 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.369
 adapt tidbits agreed with two three computers 

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:12.199
 percent through a famine 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.270
 Eve 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.649
 no matter 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:17.930
 and this the toosa opposes to that it is an external 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.160
 and here comes who tells you to quique that you use external because the one that tells you 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.710
 where are you going to clothes 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.870
 and this 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.490
 then now we are going to 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.620
 to look for this with all 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:36.319
 this boat the one we are going to put here we oppose for example 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.860
 In this one 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.839
 I put the evos opponent added that there 

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.069
 I only for the following obstacles 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.839
 i 

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:51.319
 tactically questions using bone compression
