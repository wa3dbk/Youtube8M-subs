00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.870
 hello everything is at mas we are found 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.860
 today on a video making the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.960
 storm iii and it will be a tutorial a 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.300
 tutorial to know how to do them 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.090
 elves tilt them to infinity with 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 some characters only 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:31.509
 so I want to explain all that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:37.059
 so let's start taking milla early at 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:39.070
 plan of minato these games this tutorial he 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.809
 is interesting that for him for 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.789
 the moment for now it is 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.649
 interesting that for him after we can 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.379
 I saw that we could also do 5 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.809
 magatte lÃ´ tried I have not yet the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.780
 character there is way to do it is 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.010
 in which if we re it works with 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.609
 for only the characters who are 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.489
 the pupils as to nora berra has everything 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.109
 done to style then to start 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.150
 we will try to reconcile the key 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:09.190
 normally see how you can 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.920
 see know chick of the coup I looked 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.070
 when we could continue mclean and is 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.750
 in fact that's all because 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.340
 she sends the shocks year like 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:29.540
 this one simulation of spruce and 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.790
 now just do and watch 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.990
 instant when you press 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 on square that is to say that it was necessary 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.090
 very quickly your dock must be downright 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.009
 slide you see the mine at all from 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.200
 go back and here I did you have it 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.220
 may not have noticed about the lives of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.570
 workers 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.149
 I did well because and a meal on 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.750
 the enlightenment light was career volta on 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.619
 awakening and after just assemble the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.369
 everything and why it ended because 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.180
 was waking up an atom he can 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.399
 continue tilting it by collecting the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.420
 evees you have business inclined 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.610
 tilted joystick so now that's 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.410
 a little more complicated to do 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 gold it's the manip tilted square of the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.320
 right style tilted the right stick 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 tilted and so on 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.970
 I will try to reproduce 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.080
 that they tried because it's not 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 obvious here 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.250
 world 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.840
 m 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.800
 here I finally managed by y 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.620
 arrive then as you can see 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.990
 I missed the woman because of schengen 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.480
 I hurt when he is need 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.150
 to go very quickly have to slip for 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.150
 slip and it's not necessarily obvious 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.180
 lapointe weight and blow is that of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.070
 the training is you and you 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.510
 after a while you will end up 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.780
 get there also sees you at the beginning I 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.240
 galley will get there must be done 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.670
 understand how it works and I am 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.480
 not yet ready to succeed the patient 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.480
 ranking but it's the gesture 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.980
 we 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.330
 you bonus that I decided to do because 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.450
 that some people had us 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.870
 asked is it was the world 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.760
 world map the new fashion mode its fashion 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.220
 game in parentheses you go quickly 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.930
 see why then the new mode of 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.980
 game we can see in the rankings 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.020
 and we fight single I personally 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.940
 find this system is totally useless 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.940
 and where I write you right now 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.200
 so we go to the locations and in 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.560
 French is called the map of the war 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.660
 ninjas is happy to click on it and 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.600
 Well, it just shows us 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.390
 people who want to make a fight who have 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.750
 created a session except that we will not have 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.299
 of the option to choose before as per 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.770
 eg peas or only 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.620
 the same area then see the difference 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.860
 who is looking for a discarded session 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.900
 wenger when looking for an assignment and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.820
 one can choose the rank of 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:43.700
 the opponent even stronger or the region 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.630
 there but where no matter where ben that's the 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.880
 video ends here 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.680
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.690
 that I expressed myself correctly for 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.100
 the tutorial 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.530
 if you have questions about the game 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.830
 from here the exit or little is asked to 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.880
 comments i could answer them 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.880
 go next
