00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.810 
winky faces mean we me it means it's
probably<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.020> process<00:01:12.500> already<00:01:12.820> might

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
probably in the process already might

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.660 
probably in the process already might
have<00:01:13.940> even<00:01:14.090> run<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.390> already<00:01:14.810> made<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
have even run it already made it and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.010 
have even run it already made it and
yeah<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:16.850> basically<00:01:17.120> I<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.300> think<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:17.780> means

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
yeah but basically I I think this means

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.530 
yeah but basically I I think this means
that<00:01:18.140> they've<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.550> kind<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.030> confirmed<00:01:20.480> I

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
that they've it kind of confirmed I

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.420 
that they've it kind of confirmed I
guess<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.930> guess<00:01:21.140> them<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.950> process<00:01:22.340> of

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
guess I guess them in the process of

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.130 
guess I guess them in the process of
making<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:22.850> right<00:01:23.000> now<00:01:23.150> i'm<00:01:23.690> not<00:01:23.870> sure<00:01:24.020> if
