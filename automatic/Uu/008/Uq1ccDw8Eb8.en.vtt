now<00:05:55.110> once<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.259> get<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.500> done<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:57.220> install

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
now once you get that done to install

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:08.129 
now once you get that done to install
your<00:05:57.669> GPU<00:05:59.159> you<00:06:00.159> grab<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:07.180> slide<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.990> in

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
your GPU you grab it and you slide it in

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.809 
your GPU you grab it and you slide it in
mine's<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.770> little<00:06:08.800> too<00:06:09.099> big<00:06:09.280> for<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.580> case

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
mine's a little too big for the case

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:16.170 
mine's a little too big for the case
what<00:06:10.150> does<00:06:10.449> fit<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:15.729> gotta<00:06:15.940> make<00:06:16.120> sure

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
what does fit and you gotta make sure

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.899 
what does fit and you gotta make sure
that<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:17.069> bottom<00:06:18.069> of<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:18.280> card<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:20.909> inside

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
that the bottom of the card is inside

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.999 
that the bottom of the card is inside
the<00:06:22.210> slot<00:06:22.569> you<00:06:22.810> can't<00:06:23.110> really<00:06:23.379> see<00:06:23.650> it<00:06:23.680> but<00:06:23.830> I'm

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
the slot you can't really see it but I'm

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.920 
the slot you can't really see it but I'm
pretty<00:06:24.219> sure<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:24.610> can<00:06:24.729> figure<00:06:24.940> it<00:06:25.150> out<00:06:25.300> and

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
pretty sure you can figure it out and

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.749 
pretty sure you can figure it out and
once<00:06:26.440> in<00:06:26.620> there<00:06:26.800> you'll<00:06:26.949> hear<00:06:27.129> it<00:06:27.219> click<00:06:27.490> and

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
once in there you'll hear it click and

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.089 
once in there you'll hear it click and
then<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.960> gotta<00:06:29.169> get<00:06:29.319> your<00:06:29.409> screws<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:29.979> you

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
then you gotta get your screws that you

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:33.809 
then you gotta get your screws that you
used<00:06:30.400> for<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:32.560> expansion<00:06:32.860> slots<00:06:33.370> and<00:06:33.669> just

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
used for the expansion slots and just

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.689 
used for the expansion slots and just
tie<00:06:34.000> them<00:06:34.060> down<00:06:34.210> up<00:06:34.780> here<00:06:34.949> and<00:06:35.949> I'd<00:06:36.400> see<00:06:36.580> it

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
tie them down up here and I'd see it

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.219 
tie them down up here and I'd see it
good<00:06:36.849> to<00:06:36.940> go<00:06:37.030> for<00:06:37.060> graphics<00:06:37.629> card<00:06:37.900> and<00:06:38.080> do<00:06:38.139> the

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
good to go for graphics card and do the

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.029 
good to go for graphics card and do the
same<00:06:38.409> thing<00:06:38.680> for<00:06:38.860> all<00:06:38.979> your<00:06:39.190> expansion<00:06:39.580> cards

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
same thing for all your expansion cards

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.490 
same thing for all your expansion cards
now<00:06:42.039> for<00:06:42.310> the<00:06:42.400> power<00:06:42.580> supply<00:06:43.110> all<00:06:44.110> you<00:06:44.319> gotta

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
now for the power supply all you gotta

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.550 
now for the power supply all you gotta
do<00:06:45.180> just<00:06:46.180> put<00:06:46.539> it<00:06:46.629> back<00:06:46.750> here<00:06:47.050> in<00:06:47.229> your<00:06:47.349> case

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
do just put it back here in your case

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.709 
do just put it back here in your case
let<00:06:48.129> some<00:06:48.370> level<00:06:48.610> top<00:06:48.879> or<00:06:49.060> bottom<00:06:49.090> mountain

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:51.719 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:56.189 

and<00:06:52.719> then<00:06:52.930> just<00:06:53.110> slide<00:06:53.620> it<00:06:53.770> into<00:06:53.889> the<00:06:53.979> back<00:06:55.199> and

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
and then just slide it into the back and

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.839 
and then just slide it into the back and
once<00:06:56.500> you<00:06:56.650> get<00:06:56.770> it<00:06:56.860> all<00:06:56.979> lined<00:06:57.190> up<00:06:57.430> you<00:06:57.699> just

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
once you get it all lined up you just

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.870 
once you get it all lined up you just
gotta<00:06:58.060> put<00:06:58.270> these<00:06:58.419> screws<00:06:58.810> in<00:06:59.680> there<00:06:59.949> and<00:07:00.729> then

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
gotta put these screws in there and then

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.269 
gotta put these screws in there and then
you're<00:07:01.000> good<00:07:01.150> to<00:07:01.180> go<00:07:01.650> and<00:07:02.650> all<00:07:02.860> I<00:07:02.919> have<00:07:03.039> to<00:07:03.099> do

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
you're good to go and all I have to do

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.330 
you're good to go and all I have to do
is<00:07:03.460> start<00:07:03.990> connecting<00:07:04.990> all<00:07:05.289> these<00:07:05.409> cables<00:07:05.919> to

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
is start connecting all these cables to

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.999 
is start connecting all these cables to
the<00:07:06.719> to<00:07:07.719> each<00:07:07.840> other<00:07:08.050> it's<00:07:08.409> pretty<00:07:08.680> simple

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
the to each other it's pretty simple

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.040 
the to each other it's pretty simple
because<00:07:09.310> they<00:07:09.550> all<00:07:09.639> match<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.479> can't<00:07:10.900> really

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
because they all match and can't really

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.050 
because they all match and can't really
put<00:07:11.199> them<00:07:11.289> on<00:07:11.380> the<00:07:11.469> wrong<00:07:11.620> way<00:07:11.819> once<00:07:12.819> you<00:07:12.940> got

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
put them on the wrong way once you got

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.930 
put them on the wrong way once you got
that<00:07:13.120> done<00:07:13.479> you've<00:07:14.080> built<00:07:14.349> your<00:07:14.500> PC<00:07:14.860> hope<00:07:15.759> this

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
that done you've built your PC hope this

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.210 
that done you've built your PC hope this
helped
