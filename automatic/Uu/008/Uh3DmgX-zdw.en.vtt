00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone, Vlad is in this lesson . 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.040
 I will show you how to get and build us 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.820
 logic control donesut introduce 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.820
 parental control 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:22.350
 here gives us now click and 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.320
 we get on the daemon can be configured to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.619
 10 offices threw us for this need 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.570
 create a new account click 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.570
 Create an account 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 like rik and so we drive the account name and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:04.320
 Iâ€™ll choose a miracle from an example. 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.590
 password I will not bring to give so here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.920
 our account 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920
 click on it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:46.070
 and so we see that you have a logical 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 control and at the moment it's off 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.210
 without us you didnâ€™t include such things so we 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.220
 see that we have windows options and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.000
 you can set a limit on 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.399
 of time 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.039
 games and permission were such wiped about 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:13.920
 specific problems so some kind of restriction 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:16.799
 in time we see that we can 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.989
 set the time which children that is 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.959
 this is our account will be able to work 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.239
 on the computer 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.430
 patients are allowed prohibited and we 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.350
 we can steal 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.390
 on for monday we can install 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:41.040
 what is forbidden to work on a computer 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.060
 Treatment example 10 here so press 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:56.430
 button fists here we have a limit 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:00.239
 it is important to know the restrictions on the games here we are 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.810
 see on this account laveron 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.430
 we can start building games 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.430
 ban games 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.359
 so that 's about the programs there 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.359
 a click 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 we can up to this elvira account 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.190
 use programs or work only 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.940
 resolved so let's see here we see 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:48.220
 what our system now classifies 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:51.420
 the program is waiting for some time so here 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.520
 peeling off all our programs we can 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:13.830
 put a tick in front of programs or 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:16.270
 fly and here we press the arch button and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.380
 All this program will not be 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:23.170
 run on this computer from this 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.110
 account ie account 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.420
 something here and press the button ok 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.720

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.890
