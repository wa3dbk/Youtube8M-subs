you<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> yeah<00:02:03.360> well<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you think that is yeah well I think that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.459 
you think that is yeah well I think that
some<00:02:04.409> teams<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:05.640> bad<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.479> planning<00:02:06.659> they

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
some teams are bad at planning they

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.169 
some teams are bad at planning they
don't<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.860> an<00:02:07.979> organization

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
don't have an organization

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179 
don't have an organization
supporting<00:02:10.179> them<00:02:10.329> so<00:02:10.629> it's<00:02:10.810> hard<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.439> plan<00:02:11.799> an

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
supporting them so it's hard to plan an

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.599 
supporting them so it's hard to plan an
event<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:13.510> lot<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.379> changes<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.890> course<00:02:15.159> makes

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
event a lot of changes of course makes

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.199 
event a lot of changes of course makes
stuff<00:02:16.150> horror<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.319> for<00:02:18.219> some<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:19.180> some

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
stuff horror but and for some for some

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.360 
stuff horror but and for some for some
things<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.629> requires<00:02:20.439> like<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.829> get<00:02:20.950> visas

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
things that requires like to get visas

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.580 
things that requires like to get visas
to<00:02:21.519> get<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.819> Europe<00:02:22.000> or<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.469> their

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
to get to Europe or to get out of their

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.740 
to get to Europe or to get out of their
country<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.579> be<00:02:24.609> really<00:02:24.879> hard<00:02:24.969> as<00:02:25.120> well<00:02:25.299> they

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
country can be really hard as well they

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.080 
country can be really hard as well they
can't<00:02:25.959> predict<00:02:26.349> if<00:02:26.470> they<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.799> go<00:02:26.980> or<00:02:27.099> comp<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
can't predict if they can go or comp so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.280 
can't predict if they can go or comp so
I<00:02:28.120> mean<00:02:28.269> do<00:02:28.329> you<00:02:28.420> think<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.689> event<00:02:28.989> will<00:02:29.140> be

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
I mean do you think the event will be

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
I mean do you think the event will be
lesser<00:02:30.040> than<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.519> event<00:02:30.879> now<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.209> there's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
lesser than that event now that there's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.849 
lesser than that event now that there's
less<00:02:31.480> teams<00:02:31.810> yeah<00:02:32.079> I<00:02:32.140> mean<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.560> know<00:02:32.680> they've

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
less teams yeah I mean I know they've

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.319 
less teams yeah I mean I know they've
changed<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.280> group<00:02:33.489> for<00:02:33.519> my<00:02:33.879> a<00:02:33.909> little<00:02:34.209> bit

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
changed the group for my a little bit

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.759 
changed the group for my a little bit
but<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.049> think<00:02:35.079> it<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.379> still<00:02:35.560> be<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
but do you think it can still be a

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.770 
but do you think it can still be a
pretty<00:02:35.980> pretty<00:02:36.400> sick<00:02:36.639> event<00:02:36.879> or<00:02:37.090> yeah<00:02:37.480> i<00:02:37.510> mean

with some good dream dropped but still

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.250 
with some good dream dropped but still

god I can't expect that we I don't
expect<00:03:44.260> us<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.680> win<00:03:44.829> but<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.579> believe<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.690> we

expect us to win but I believe that we

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.899 
expect us to win but I believe that we
can<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:47.019> really<00:03:47.260> well<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.879> believe<00:03:48.879> that

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.000 
can do really well and I I believe that
we<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.419> course<00:03:49.479> have<00:03:50.049> their<00:03:50.229> possibility<00:03:50.859> win

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
we of course have their possibility win

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.000 
we of course have their possibility win
I<00:03:51.250> mean<00:03:51.849> obviously<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:53.590> such<00:03:53.799> little

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
I mean obviously with such little

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.159 
I mean obviously with such little
practice<00:03:54.519> time<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.419> tough<00:03:55.659> to<00:03:55.840> do<00:03:55.959> that

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
practice time it's it's tough to do that

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.349 
practice time it's it's tough to do that
book<00:03:56.409> I<00:03:56.560> mean<00:03:56.859> how<00:03:57.010> hope<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> rules<00:03:57.669> changed

scope in there so how will that affect

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.629 
scope in there so how will that affect
you<00:04:05.290> know<00:04:05.470> how<00:04:05.590> are<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:05.919> new<00:04:06.069> rules<00:04:06.310> looking

have been training a lot or not using a
scope<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:12.419> son<00:04:13.419> i<00:04:13.659> would<00:04:14.500> say<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.709> most<00:04:14.949> Maps

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
scope on son i would say on most Maps

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.949 
scope on son i would say on most Maps
you<00:04:15.729> don't<00:04:15.939> actually<00:04:16.150> lose<00:04:16.449> anything<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
you don't actually lose anything you

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.410 
you don't actually lose anything you
have<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.139> change<00:04:17.529> smokey<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.789> change

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
have to change smokey and the change

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.720 
have to change smokey and the change
this<00:04:19.630> yes<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.110> have<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.320> be<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:20.740> working

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
this yes you have to be in like working

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.690 
this yes you have to be in like working
around<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.920> think<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.520> we're

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
around it and I think that we're

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.180 
around it and I think that we're
actually<00:04:25.390> really<00:04:25.810> really<00:04:26.080> strong<00:04:26.440> with<00:04:26.890> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
actually really really strong with the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.800 
actually really really strong with the
tactics<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:27.820> feel<00:04:28.030> confident<00:04:28.510> with<00:04:28.750> it

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
tactics and we feel confident with it

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.710 
tactics and we feel confident with it
we've<00:04:29.380> always<00:04:29.590> been<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.010> like<00:04:30.600> playing<00:04:31.600> a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
we've always been in like playing a

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.850 
we've always been in like playing a
false<00:04:32.200> game<00:04:32.530> aggressive<00:04:33.030> kind<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.150> place<00:04:34.330> five

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
false game aggressive kind of place five

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.970 
false game aggressive kind of place five
and<00:04:35.860> now<00:04:36.040> with<00:04:36.240> without<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.360> scope<00:04:37.720> we<00:04:38.590> it's

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
and now with without a scope we it's

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.920 
and now with without a scope we it's
hard<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.370> find<00:04:39.640> scope<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.570> play<00:04:40.720> real

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
hard to find scope that can play real

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.440 
hard to find scope that can play real
aggressive<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.530> getting<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.640> another<00:04:42.940> AK

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
aggressive and getting like another AK

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.500 
aggressive and getting like another AK
in<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.690> mix<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.800> can<00:04:44.950> you<00:04:45.310> can<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.940> move

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
in the mix you can you can you can move

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.420 
in the mix you can you can you can move
your<00:04:46.570> game<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.050> another<00:04:47.110> dimension<00:04:47.410> it's<00:04:47.890> it

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
your game to another dimension it's it

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.630 
your game to another dimension it's it
looks<00:04:48.760> really<00:04:49.090> good<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.480> really<00:04:49.750> fun

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
looks really good and it's really fun

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
especially with you guys it'll possibly

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.270 
especially with you guys it'll possibly
be<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.810> little<00:04:59.380> bit<00:04:59.560> weaker<00:04:59.830> with<00:04:59.950> that<00:05:00.130> lack

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
be in a little bit weaker with that lack

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.550 
be in a little bit weaker with that lack
of<00:05:00.430> practice<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:01.990> see<00:05:02.170> there<00:05:02.320> are<00:05:02.380> some

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
of practice as you see there are some

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
of practice as you see there are some
good<00:05:02.770> teams<00:05:03.010> of<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.310> event<00:05:03.580> well<00:05:04.210> what<00:05:04.690> teams

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
good teams of the event well what teams

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.590 
good teams of the event well what teams
do<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.200> see<00:05:05.410> being<00:05:06.340> your<00:05:06.580> toughest<00:05:07.000> opponents

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
do you see being your toughest opponents

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.530 
do you see being your toughest opponents
or<00:05:07.750> speak<00:05:08.610> especially<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:10.090> know<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.330> first

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
or speak especially you know the first

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.480 
or speak especially you know the first
group<00:05:10.840> stage<00:05:11.080> for<00:05:11.440> example<00:05:11.830> before<00:05:12.100> you<00:05:12.340> get

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
group stage for example before you get

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.660 
group stage for example before you get
the<00:05:12.610> playoffs<00:05:14.100> well<00:05:15.100> many<00:05:15.400> people<00:05:15.460> are

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
the playoffs well many people are

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.820 
the playoffs well many people are
talking<00:05:16.150> about<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.750> rapacious<00:05:17.140> I<00:05:17.500> think<00:05:17.710> that

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
talking about and rapacious I think that

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.180 
talking about and rapacious I think that
they<00:05:18.040> are<00:05:18.270> one<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.510> heart<00:05:19.720> teams<00:05:20.010> to<00:05:21.010> get

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
they are one of the heart teams to get

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.430 
they are one of the heart teams to get
through<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.580> mean<00:05:21.730> they're<00:05:21.990> they<00:05:22.990> don't<00:05:23.170> maybe

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
through I mean they're they don't maybe

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.050 
through I mean they're they don't maybe
they<00:05:23.590> don't<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.950> like<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.250> best<00:05:24.400> results<00:05:24.880> on

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
they don't have like the best results on

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.110 
they don't have like the best results on
paper<00:05:25.330> but<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.690> think<00:05:25.930> they<00:05:26.020> got<00:05:26.110> potential<00:05:27.120> and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
paper but I think they got potential and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.570 
paper but I think they got potential and
if<00:05:28.420> they<00:05:28.540> can<00:05:28.720> show<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.860> potential<00:05:30.310> tomorrow

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
if they can show that potential tomorrow

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.240 
if they can show that potential tomorrow
tomorrow<00:05:31.030> they<00:05:31.510> will<00:05:31.540> be<00:05:31.780> great<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:35.250> well

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
tomorrow they will be great and well

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.700 
tomorrow they will be great and well
since<00:05:36.760> I<00:05:36.910> think<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.300> we<00:05:37.390> got<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.840> easier

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
since I think that we got the easier

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.670 
since I think that we got the easier
group<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.280> I'll<00:05:39.460> do<00:05:39.610> so<00:05:40.420> I<00:05:40.450> don't<00:05:40.780> know<00:05:40.870> the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
group and I'll do so I don't know the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.490 
group and I'll do so I don't know the
rest<00:05:41.860> teams<00:05:42.100> I<00:05:42.510> think<00:05:43.510> we<00:05:43.660> should<00:05:43.690> be<00:05:44.170> able<00:05:44.230> to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
rest teams I think we should be able to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.670 
rest teams I think we should be able to
go<00:05:45.040> through<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.460> bones<00:05:45.640> no<00:05:46.540> well<00:05:47.140> you<00:05:47.590> know

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
go through the bones no well you know
