calories<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.940> cool<00:01:00.239> thing<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
calories the one cool thing about this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.709 
calories the one cool thing about this
is<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.160> skip<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> meal

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is that if you skip out on a meal

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
is that if you skip out on a meal
the<00:01:04.140> next<00:01:04.470> meal<00:01:04.650> you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.250> you're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the next meal you're gonna have you're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
the next meal you're gonna have you're
gonna<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.909> extremely<00:01:06.450> hungry<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> guess

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna be extremely hungry so I guess

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.429 
gonna be extremely hungry so I guess
that<00:01:08.220> could<00:01:08.369> counter<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.240> negative<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that could counter a negative to this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.280 
that could counter a negative to this
