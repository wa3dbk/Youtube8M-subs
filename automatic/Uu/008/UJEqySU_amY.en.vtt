an instance name in my properties panel

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.860 
an instance name in my properties panel
of<00:02:31.720> VI<00:02:32.720> D<00:02:32.980> underscore<00:02:33.980> our<00:02:34.850> AME<00:02:35.690> did<00:02:36.290> frame<00:02:36.650> and

of VI D underscore our AME did frame and
now<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.310> pop<00:02:40.580> my<00:02:40.730> code<00:02:41.000> in

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
now all I got to do is pop my code in

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.580 
now all I got to do is pop my code in
there<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.750> let's<00:02:41.900> make<00:02:42.050> another<00:02:42.319> layer<00:02:42.530> for

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
there so let's make another layer for

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.020 
there so let's make another layer for
the<00:02:42.920> code<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:44.260> I've<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.530> my<00:02:45.739> video<00:02:46.340> code<00:02:46.760> all

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the code and I've got my video code all

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.580 
the code and I've got my video code all
assembled<00:02:47.600> here<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.080> want<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.350> get<00:02:48.470> to

assembled here and if you want to get to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.080 
assembled here and if you want to get to
this<00:02:48.709> code<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.579> do<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:50.030> to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
this code all you have to do is go to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.140 
this code all you have to do is go to
develop<00:02:50.480> PHP<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.260> download<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.190> source

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
develop PHP and download this source

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.630 
develop PHP and download this source
tutorial<00:02:53.810> files<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.850> there's<00:02:56.269> my<00:02:56.480> code<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
tutorial files and there's my code and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.120 
tutorial files and there's my code and
this<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.700> instance<00:02:59.450> name<00:02:59.660> vid<00:02:59.959> frame<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.980> now

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
this is instance name vid frame so now

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
this is instance name vid frame so now
the<00:03:01.190> video<00:03:01.519> should<00:03:01.760> play<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.239> point<00:03:02.540> but

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the video should play at this point but

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.000 
the video should play at this point but
we're<00:03:03.410> not<00:03:03.530> done<00:03:03.739> yet

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
we're not done yet

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.500 
we're not done yet
so<00:03:04.820> let's<00:03:05.180> see<00:03:05.329> if<00:03:05.420> we<00:03:05.630> render<00:03:06.290> out<00:03:07.510> okay

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
so let's see if we render out okay

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.979 
so let's see if we render out okay
there's<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.840> video<00:03:09.049> playing<00:03:10.570> let's<00:03:11.570> bring<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
there's the video playing let's bring it

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.479 
there's the video playing let's bring it
up<00:03:12.110> one<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.239> should<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> good<00:03:14.690> spot

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
up one and that should be a good spot

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.300 
up one and that should be a good spot
okay<00:03:16.489> now<00:03:16.730> we're<00:03:17.120> gonna<00:03:17.180> resize<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.440> fit

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
okay now we're gonna resize it to fit

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.690 
okay now we're gonna resize it to fit
inside<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.780> gonna<00:03:21.010> loops<00:03:22.010> before

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
inside of that it's gonna loops before

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.340 
inside of that it's gonna loops before
we<00:03:22.940> do<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.090> let's<00:03:23.420> move<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.750> registration

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
we do that let's move the registration

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.090 
we do that let's move the registration
dot<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> top<00:03:26.390> or<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.200> transform<00:03:27.709> dot<00:03:27.920> to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
dot to the top or the transform dot to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.699 
dot to the top or the transform dot to
the<00:03:28.220> top<00:03:28.430> left<00:03:29.030> now<00:03:29.720> I'll<00:03:29.930> pull<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.170> up<00:03:30.410> to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
the top left now I'll pull it up to

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.229 
the top left now I'll pull it up to
where<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:30.920> fits<00:03:31.130> right<00:03:31.370> inside<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.970> screen

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
where it fits right inside of the screen

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.849 
where it fits right inside of the screen
and<00:03:33.079> now<00:03:33.190> it'll<00:03:34.190> play<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.180> press<00:03:35.859> to

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
and now it'll play when I press to

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.640 
and now it'll play when I press to
render<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.310> file<00:03:37.549> out<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.470> it's<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
render the file out you see it's a

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.319 
render the file out you see it's a
little<00:03:39.769> distorted<00:03:40.280> but<00:03:40.850> that's<00:03:41.000> okay<00:03:41.299> because

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
little distorted but that's okay because

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.060 
little distorted but that's okay because
we're<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.780> for<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.079> skewed<00:03:42.380> effect<00:03:42.680> anyway

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
we're going for the skewed effect anyway

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.340 
we're going for the skewed effect anyway
now<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.180> we'll<00:03:44.390> just<00:03:44.540> go<00:03:44.690> back<00:03:44.840> out<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
now so we'll just go back out to the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.140 
now so we'll just go back out to the
main<00:03:45.500> scene<00:03:45.829> now<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.130> can<00:03:46.370> press<00:03:46.579> main<00:03:46.850> scene

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the stage there and it'll bring it back

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.460 
the stage there and it'll bring it back
to<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.640> main<00:03:52.819> scene<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.360> now<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:53.959> have<00:03:54.230> both

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.589 
want you can move it up down and around
and<00:04:35.380> let's<00:04:36.380> do<00:04:36.620> something<00:04:36.890> crazy<00:04:37.159> like<00:04:37.310> that

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
and let's do something crazy like that

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.730 
and let's do something crazy like that
see<00:04:38.599> what<00:04:38.720> happens

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.159 

see<00:04:43.740> that's<00:04:43.979> funky<00:04:44.370> fresh<00:04:44.610> man<00:04:44.879> you<00:04:45.840> can't<00:04:46.050> get

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
see that's funky fresh man you can't get

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.980 
see that's funky fresh man you can't get
any<00:04:46.319> easier<00:04:46.349> than<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.979> in<00:04:47.219> flash<00:04:47.490> cs3<00:04:47.990> you

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
any easier than that in flash cs3 you

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.429 
any easier than that in flash cs3 you
had<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:50.090> use<00:04:51.090> something<00:04:51.479> like<00:04:51.509> paper<00:04:51.870> vision

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
had to use something like paper vision

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.959 
had to use something like paper vision
or<00:04:52.849> Shh

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969

I<00:04:54.000> forget<00:04:54.479> what<00:04:54.629> it's<00:04:54.750> called<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:55.020> think<00:04:55.139> it's

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
I forget what it's called I think it's

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.450 
I forget what it's called I think it's

something<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.759> but<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.120> lets<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.419> that

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
something like that but it lets you that

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.339 
something like that but it lets you that
and<00:05:01.379> paper<00:05:01.680> vision<00:05:01.979> will<00:05:02.159> let<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.960> skew<00:05:03.960> video

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
and paper vision will let you skew video

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.529 
and paper vision will let you skew video
like<00:05:05.310> this<00:05:05.550> but<00:05:05.909> it's<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.120> whole<00:05:06.270> lot<00:05:06.419> more

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
like this but it's a whole lot more

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.659 
like this but it's a whole lot more
complicated<00:05:06.719> and<00:05:07.259> flash<00:05:07.590> cs4<00:05:08.219> makes<00:05:08.490> it

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
complicated and flash cs4 makes it

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.059 
complicated and flash cs4 makes it
really<00:05:08.879> easy<00:05:09.259> so<00:05:10.259> we<00:05:10.409> hope<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.710> enjoyed<00:05:10.979> this

one<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:12.270> get<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.569> the<00:05:12.689> code<00:05:12.960> for<00:05:13.289> the<00:05:13.379> video

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
one and to get to the code for the video

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.850 
one and to get to the code for the video
to<00:05:13.949> play<00:05:14.129> the<00:05:14.279> video<00:05:14.400> like<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.849> did<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:15.240> easily

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
to play the video like I did so easily

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.670 
to play the video like I did so easily
and<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.039> video<00:05:17.279> is<00:05:17.340> just<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:19.020> show<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.349> it's

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
and the video is just a to show you it's

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.350 
and the video is just a to show you it's
in<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.009> directory<00:05:20.430> sitting<00:05:20.849> there<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.210> it's

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
in the directory sitting there and it's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.149 
in the directory sitting there and it's
called<00:05:22.789> right<00:05:23.789> there<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.180> video<00:05:24.569> dot<00:05:25.500> flv

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
called right there it's video dot flv

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.179 
called right there it's video dot flv
and<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:27.330> code<00:05:27.569> I<00:05:27.840> popped<00:05:28.289> in<00:05:28.500> there<00:05:28.680> refers<00:05:29.159> to

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
and the code I popped in there refers to

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.439 
and the code I popped in there refers to
and<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:29.669> get<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:29.939> the<00:05:30.029> code<00:05:30.240> by

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
and you can get to the code by

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.809 
and you can get to the code by
