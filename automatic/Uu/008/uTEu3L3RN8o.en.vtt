 Thursday and well let's go to the packaging 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.130
 to see how it looks on our iphone 4 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.940
 or if we go to the opening explain them more 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.940
 or less 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.570
 what is this about the covers 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.670
 interchangeable as you can see 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.160
 here we have the case that comes with 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.290
 an exchangeable tablet here 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 we would have that comes with the desire the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.600
 White color 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.320
 and we already have the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.910
 a yellow and a black then the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.410
 idea of ​​this in case you 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.199

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.770
 very simple upload the photo with one is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.000
 that are on the product page 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.710
 you have found several 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.799
 alternatives the first logically is 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 take the case the second is in case 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.580
 that you say maybe others 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.740
 colors because as I tell you it comes in 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 yellow black and white in case of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.569
 you want other colors are going to be able 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.690
 also buy different stages of 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.550
 other colors that you are going to see in 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.539
 the product page as they turn 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.580
 to also have the option to be able 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.289
 customize case you want 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.720
 customize yourself click on that area and go 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.610
 to be referred to a page will not go 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.860
 to build the photo and play 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.899
 let's say more or less how they want the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.789
 picture go in the back of the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.509
 top and in this way then you 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.860
 personalize your case for iphone 4 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.170
 or 4 s 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.060
 in this case at the end of the video then 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.490
 say the prices in this case let's say 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.220
 we want to place the lid 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.760
 yellow 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:10.509
 so logically this did not wake me up 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.010
 expert with which left that is what 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.239
 only thing that we do is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.760
 slide the cell phone is to install 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.060
 so far 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.230
 the cellular device through the slots 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 of the case and then logically 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.190
 and enter 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.140
 arrow 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.180
 the other part of the case that you 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.490
 they listen in click because there you already 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.790
 have installed and that's how it would look 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.280
 the cell phone 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.629
 with 44 s with this michaels case let's go 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.260
 to see the accessibility part you 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.709
 they will see that there is not a problem 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 as I said for the iphone 4s also 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.659
 volume also input for good 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.659
 do 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.160
 this headset has gentlemen noises the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.349
 paid day but there is nothing and here has 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.580
 a single hole for what not to do the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.750
 parlament the microphone and the connector and 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.720
 front you will see that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.580
 It has a small relief to protect 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.280
 let's say the gentleman when they do not place it in 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.220
 the part let's say for a surface 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 flat will project definitions of your 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 front screen does not come with the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.700
 frontal protector let's see 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.319
 no it does not come with frontal protector but 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.970
 in the background, as I tell you, 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.579
 this reality to help protect 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.860
 the screen in case you do not 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.920
 place flat surfaces the part 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.920
 posterior is well protected and the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.780
 hole is wide in the part of the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.049
 camera and the flash to avoid then 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.060
 quality problems of photos in the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.560
 part of the sides you can see 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.780
 which is an opaque color is plastic and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.450
 in the back, it's a classic 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.579
 more shiny but if it is plastic 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.870
 they study it is silicone and good 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:14.109
 recent impact absorbs closer but 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.479
 I do not always recommend that one 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.720
 release your cell phone and nothing like that for 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.579
 be able to test the case not to be able to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.840
 withdraw to be able to exchange the part 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.580
 later that is very simple that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.220
 you can withdraw them as you 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.220
 have seen and we will place the target 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.860
 you slide 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.040
 the interchangeable part 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.040
 and in the same way 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.900
 and ready and it 's over we 've 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.100
 changed white color in a very 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.010
 quick and easy as you have 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.430
 could see and continues to protect our 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.830
 cellular if you do not remove the case not background 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.260
 the case and if we would not have to 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.150
 we remove is the part of the sheet 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.830
 you can appreciate how it would look 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.990
 listen to this, they are going to have the name of 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.240
 the company but logically the idea is 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.440
 that is protected and that is 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.830
 beautiful 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.460
 in this case it is opaque of the same color 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.460
 that the case 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.080
 as its prey 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.370
 place it on this one 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.160
 this monitor I listen to how you can 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.320
 appreciate and the interesting thing is with tapas 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.090
 interchangeable and you can 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.990
 customize them directly in the 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.120
 web page 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.210
 so if you are interested you already know what 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.620
 that you can do is click on the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.540
 link that is in the area of 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.800

 directly to the product page and 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.140
 can read a little more with respect to 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.650
 how can you not customize the table 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.020
 later 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.230
 the cost of this case is 29 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.520
 95 dollars the extra caps in case of 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.870
 you want to buy other colors 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.110
 because as I mentioned there is a 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.170
 diversity of colors that one can 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.480
 buy extra and turn those 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.730
 vouchers 995 and in turn in case of you 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.950
 want to customize the back 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.360
 of that with logo is company or with the photo 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.550
 of your family either for a gift that 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.090
 want to make a family, then in the 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.390
 cost of 1995 the case is that they want 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.470
 make a custom sheet and that 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.880
