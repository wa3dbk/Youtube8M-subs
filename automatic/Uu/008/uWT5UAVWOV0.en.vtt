and then I'm gonna cut a small hole in

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.240 
and then I'm gonna cut a small hole in
part<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.049> Ziploc<00:03:19.410> baggie<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:22.250> with

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
part of the Ziploc baggie just here with

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.270 
part of the Ziploc baggie just here with
that<00:03:23.489> full<00:03:23.790> cut<00:03:24.650> expand<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.069> little

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
bit and then we're gonna slide this on

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.430 
bit and then we're gonna slide this on
top<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.579> camera<00:03:32.750> then<00:03:33.750> we<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.169> just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
top of our camera then we can just

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
top of our camera then we can just
stretch<00:03:34.709> our<00:03:34.980> hole<00:03:36.019> around<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.470> lens<00:03:43.910> then<00:03:44.910> we

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
stretch our hole around the lens then we

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.820 
stretch our hole around the lens then we
can<00:03:45.150> pop<00:03:45.389> on<00:03:45.629> our<00:03:45.930> protective<00:03:47.599> lens

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.240 

just<00:03:57.700> like<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.030> our<00:03:58.660> GoPro<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.590> protected

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
just like that our GoPro is protected

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.240 
just like that our GoPro is protected
from<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.520> elements<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.990> lens<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.560> still

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
from the elements and the lens is still

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.330 
from the elements and the lens is still
clear<00:04:04.200> now<00:04:05.200> we<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.440> get<00:04:05.560> our<00:04:05.770> portable

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
clear now we can get our portable

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.840 
clear now we can get our portable
battery<00:04:06.610> bank<00:04:06.850> we'll<00:04:07.510> keep<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.870> inside<00:04:08.230> the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
battery bank we'll keep this inside the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.190 
battery bank we'll keep this inside the
ziplock<00:04:09.850> baggie<00:04:10.210> -<00:04:10.390> or<00:04:10.600> under<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.870> protection

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
ziplock baggie - or under the protection

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.500 
ziplock baggie - or under the protection
of<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.740> we<00:04:11.890> can<00:04:12.010> come<00:04:12.190> here<00:04:12.490> I'll<00:04:13.180> plug<00:04:13.390> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
of it so we can come here I'll plug it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.009 
of it so we can come here I'll plug it
in<00:04:14.340> we're<00:04:15.340> gonna<00:04:15.430> use<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.880> 1<00:04:16.420> amp<00:04:16.630> port

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
in we're gonna use the 1 amp port

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.050 
in we're gonna use the 1 amp port
because<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:18.100> GoPro<00:04:18.430> does<00:04:18.519> not<00:04:18.670> demand<00:04:19.000> that

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
because the GoPro does not demand that

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.910 
because the GoPro does not demand that
much<00:04:19.299> power<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.049> battery<00:04:20.410> on<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
much power and the battery on the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.100 
much power and the battery on the
battery<00:04:21.220> bank<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.549> actually<00:04:21.850> last<00:04:22.600> longer

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
battery bank can actually last longer

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.140 
battery bank can actually last longer
powering<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.890> 1<00:04:24.070> amp<00:04:24.220> port<00:04:24.520> than<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.790> 2<00:04:24.940> amp

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
powering the 1 amp port than the 2 amp

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.190 
powering the 1 amp port than the 2 amp
port<00:04:25.860> raises<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.040> little<00:04:27.190> bit<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:29.080> like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
port raises up a little bit just like

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020 
port raises up a little bit just like

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
gonna recording for about forty 24 hours

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.620 
gonna recording for about forty 24 hours
so<00:05:26.890> I'm<00:05:27.040> gonna<00:05:27.190> record<00:05:27.460> roughly<00:05:28.300> about<00:05:28.450> a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
so I'm gonna record roughly about a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.190 
so I'm gonna record roughly about a
minute

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
minute

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.290

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
time lapse off of that I can speed it up

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.620 
time lapse off of that I can speed it up
if<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.480> want<00:05:31.720> but<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.850> think<00:05:33.850> that's<00:05:34.180> definitely

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
if I want but I think that's definitely

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.440 
if I want but I think that's definitely
I<00:05:34.930> don't<00:05:35.169> want<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.410> any<00:05:36.150> slower<00:05:37.150> than<00:05:37.419> that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
I don't want it any slower than that

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.680 
I don't want it any slower than that

awesome if you're outdoors or you're
kind<00:06:00.850> of<00:06:00.910> off<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.180> grid<00:06:01.479> somewhere<00:06:02.169> and<00:06:02.260> you

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
kind of off the grid somewhere and you
