now the graphics on here are the
integrated<00:02:56.319> HD<00:02:56.500> 3200<00:02:57.160> from<00:02:57.519> ATI<00:02:57.790> Radeon<00:02:57.850> so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
integrated HD 3200 from ATI Radeon so

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.110 
integrated HD 3200 from ATI Radeon so
those<00:02:58.840> are<00:02:59.019> not<00:02:59.310> you<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.370> super<00:03:00.790> stellar<00:03:01.000> as

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
those are not you know super stellar as

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.729 
those are not you know super stellar as
far<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.420> gaming<00:03:01.750> performance<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.170> concerned

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
far as gaming performance is concerned

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.470 
far as gaming performance is concerned
you<00:03:02.860> can't<00:03:03.130> play<00:03:03.280> simple<00:03:03.580> games<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.330> can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you can't play simple games and you can

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.150 
you can't play simple games and you can
do<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:04.840> anything<00:03:05.200> that's<00:03:05.470> processor

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
do just about anything that's processor

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.949 
do just about anything that's processor
intensive<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.730> if<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.209> wanted<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.480> play<00:03:07.630> more

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
intensive but if you wanted to play more

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.330 
intensive but if you wanted to play more
extreme<00:03:08.319> video<00:03:08.530> games<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.920> definitely

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
extreme video games and you definitely

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.830 
extreme video games and you definitely
want<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.640> dedicated<00:03:10.180> graphics<00:03:10.390> card

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
want to get a dedicated graphics card

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.050 
want to get a dedicated graphics card
but<00:03:10.900> what's<00:03:11.560> important<00:03:11.950> about<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.190> AC<00:03:12.340> 3200

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
but what's important about the AC 3200

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.430 
but what's important about the AC 3200
graphics<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.450> they<00:03:13.600> are<00:03:13.750> strong<00:03:14.200> enough<00:03:14.380> to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
graphics is they are strong enough to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.220 
graphics is they are strong enough to
play<00:03:14.760> basically<00:03:15.760> any<00:03:16.030> HD<00:03:16.630> file<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.140> want

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
play basically any HD file that you want

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.110 
play basically any HD file that you want
you<00:03:17.380> can<00:03:17.470> play<00:03:17.590> any<00:03:17.829> HP<00:03:18.160> movie<00:03:18.610> no<00:03:18.760> matter<00:03:18.910> how

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
you can play any HP movie no matter how

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.060 
you can play any HP movie no matter how
high<00:03:19.810> quality<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.380> bitrate<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.950> could

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
high quality of the bitrate is it could

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.550 
high quality of the bitrate is it could
be<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.160> blu-ray<00:03:21.640> high<00:03:22.510> quality<00:03:22.900> 25<00:03:23.200> megabit<00:03:23.530> per

be a blu-ray high quality 25 megabit per

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.199 
be a blu-ray high quality 25 megabit per
second<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.070> it'll<00:03:24.220> play<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.549> no<00:03:24.730> problem<00:03:25.090> with

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
second and it'll play it no problem with

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.900 
second and it'll play it no problem with
that<00:03:25.420> integrated<00:03:26.350> graphics<00:03:26.530> now<00:03:26.920> beyond<00:03:27.760> that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that integrated graphics now beyond that

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.370 
that integrated graphics now beyond that
you<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.329> a<00:03:28.420> one<00:03:28.630> terabyte<00:03:28.930> hard<00:03:29.110> drive

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
you do have a one terabyte hard drive

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.259 
you do have a one terabyte hard drive
and<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:29.950> mentioned<00:03:30.220> earlier<00:03:30.280> more<00:03:30.970> memory

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
and like I mentioned earlier more memory

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.490 
and like I mentioned earlier more memory
than<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.630> shake<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> stick<00:03:31.959> at<00:03:32.260> 8

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
than you can shake a stick at 8

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.220 
than you can shake a stick at 8
