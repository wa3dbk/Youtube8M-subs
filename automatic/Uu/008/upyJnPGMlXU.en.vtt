00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and mmm and yeah teaching you the build

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.010 
and mmm and yeah teaching you the build
and<00:00:32.700> everything<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> camera<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.780> anyway

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and everything for the camera so anyway

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
and everything for the camera so anyway
first<00:00:34.829> probe<00:00:35.100> goes<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> build

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
first probe goes on I'm going to build

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
first probe goes on I'm going to build
my<00:00:35.969> pile<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.360> down<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.630> nine<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:37.200> standard

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
my pile on down at nine very standard

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
my pile on down at nine very standard
and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> probe<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.540> moving

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and then this probe you can see moving

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.630 
and then this probe you can see moving
it<00:00:40.440> around<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:40.980> base<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it around a bit in my base is going to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
it around a bit in my base is going to
go<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.140> straightaway<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> enemy<00:00:43.620> space

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
go to straightaway to the enemy space

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
go to straightaway to the enemy space
and<00:00:44.100> you'll<00:00:44.190> notice<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> cue<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.149> move

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and you'll notice here I cue up move

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
and you'll notice here I cue up move
commands<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.489> there

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
commands to see one there there there

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.049 
commands to see one there there there
there<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> side<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there and these are all down the side of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.279 
there and these are all down the side of
the<00:00:51.239> map<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.590> secret<00:00:53.010> hallway

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
the map down that little secret hallway

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.750 
the map down that little secret hallway
and<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.730> doesn't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and basically that is just so he doesn't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
and basically that is just so he doesn't
see<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.300> probe<00:00:57.600> moving<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
see my probe moving out because it is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
see my probe moving out because it is
quite<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.430> early<00:00:59.670> time<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.000> scalp<00:01:00.300> turn<00:01:00.480> off

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
quite an early time to scalp turn off

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
quite an early time to scalp turn off
your<00:01:00.750> pile<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.170> some<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> some

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your pile on some people do do it some

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
your pile on some people do do it some
people<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:03.170> most<00:01:04.170> people<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.530> actually

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
people don't most people don't actually

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.380 
people don't most people don't actually
and<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.549> someone<00:01:05.790> scouting<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and if you see someone scouting that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.469 
and if you see someone scouting that
early<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.939> especially<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.119> Protoss

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
early you can especially if it's Protoss

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
early you can especially if it's Protoss
play<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.260> predict<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> he's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
play you can actually predict that he's

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.859 
play you can actually predict that he's
going<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.729> sort<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.000> cheese<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:12.689> some

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
going for some sort of cheese or some

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.499 
going for some sort of cheese or some
sort<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> cannon<00:01:13.409> rush<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.830> proxy<00:01:14.340> even<00:01:14.610> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
sort of cannon rush or proxy even so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
sort of cannon rush or proxy even so
that's<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> reason<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> move<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.619> probe<00:01:16.830> down

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that's the reason I move my probe down

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.560 
that's the reason I move my probe down
there<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> wouldn't<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.240> build

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
there so you wouldn't see it I do build

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.190 
there so you wouldn't see it I do build

go<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.320> me<00:01:34.500> boxing<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
go here and can see me boxing in a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.499 
go here and can see me boxing in a
little<00:01:35.610> area<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.090> basically<00:01:36.299> where

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
little area and that's basically where

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
little area and that's basically where
I'm<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> build<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.110> pile<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.590> right

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
I'm going to build my pile on right

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
I'm going to build my pile on right
outside<00:01:38.009> his<00:01:38.250> base<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:39.270> hasn't<00:01:39.570> gone<00:01:39.630> his

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
outside his base he hasn't gone his

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.240 
outside his base he hasn't gone his
probe<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.350> base<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.860> does<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.579> fort

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
probe in my base now he does see my fort

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
probe in my base now he does see my fort
doesn't<00:01:44.250> necessarily<00:01:44.790> mean<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> cannon<00:01:45.299> rush

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
doesn't necessarily mean in cannon rush

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
doesn't necessarily mean in cannon rush
with<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.869> most<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> does

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
with that most of the time it does

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.510 
with that most of the time it does
though<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.540> probably<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:49.340> probably<00:01:50.340> does

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
though so he probably is probably does

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700 
though so he probably is probably does
know<00:01:50.759> what's<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.470> never<00:01:52.649> know

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
know what's going on now you never know

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
know what's going on now you never know
I<00:01:52.829> could<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.729> sort<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
I could be going for some sort of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
I could be going for some sort of
expansion<00:01:54.600> build<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.049> something<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
expansion build or something but if you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
expansion build or something but if you
see<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> forging<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> base<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
see a forging the base like that so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
see a forging the base like that so
early<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:59.060> can<00:02:00.060> probably<00:02:00.390> expect

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
early you probably can probably expect

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
early you probably can probably expect
Cameron<00:02:01.110> rush<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.770> anyway<00:02:02.009> I've<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.460> pile

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Cameron rush so anyway I've got my pile

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
Cameron rush so anyway I've got my pile
on<00:02:02.850> down<00:02:03.030> i'm<00:02:03.180> saving<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.719> minerals<00:02:04.049> i

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
on down i'm saving up my minerals i

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.929 
on down i'm saving up my minerals i
build<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> cannon<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
build a cannon right there and the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.130 
build a cannon right there and the
reason<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.270> build<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> cannon<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> low

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
reason you build a cannon on the low

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.359 
reason you build a cannon on the low
ground<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> build<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
ground it's because when you build the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.279 
ground it's because when you build the
cannons<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> high<00:02:09.060> ground<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.539> he<00:02:10.020> sends

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
cannons on the high ground and he sends

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
cannons on the high ground and he sends
his<00:02:10.349> probes<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.830> thereafter<00:02:11.039> whatever<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.730> try

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
his probes or thereafter whatever to try

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.530 
his probes or thereafter whatever to try
and<00:02:12.599> kill<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:12.870> cannons

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and kill your cannons

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.030 
and kill your cannons
first<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.659> all<00:02:14.750> your<00:02:15.319> cannon<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:15.890> low

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
first of all your cannon on the low

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.649 
first of all your cannon on the low
ground<00:02:16.219> can<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:16.700> fire<00:02:16.939> up<00:02:17.209> at<00:02:17.420> his

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
ground can actually fire up at his

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.569 
ground can actually fire up at his
probes<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.230> zealots<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.739> he<00:02:19.280> won't<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.519> able

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
probes and zealots and he won't be able

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.910 
probes and zealots and he won't be able
to<00:02:19.760> damage<00:02:19.969> it<00:02:20.409> another<00:02:21.409> reason<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:21.739> building

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
to damage it another reason for building

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.949 
to damage it another reason for building
the<00:02:22.129> pile<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.609> the<00:02:22.730> low<00:02:22.969> ground<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.450> basically

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
the pile on the low ground is basically

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.559 
the pile on the low ground is basically
because<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:25.790> won't<00:02:25.969> be<00:02:26.030> able<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.269> kill<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
because you won't be able to kill the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.649 
because you won't be able to kill the
pylon<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.799> on<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> low<00:02:28.099> ground<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.510> all

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
pylon if it's on the low ground so all

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.849 
pylon if it's on the low ground so all
your<00:02:29.780> cannons<00:02:30.109> in<00:02:30.170> his<00:02:30.319> base<00:02:30.469> are<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.799> be

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
your cannons in his base are going to be

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.709 
your cannons in his base are going to be
powered<00:02:31.129> by<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> pile<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.639> the<00:02:31.849> low<00:02:32.000> ground<00:02:32.180> he's

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
powered by a pile on the low ground he's

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.030 
powered by a pile on the low ground he's
not<00:02:32.840> gonna<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:32.989> able<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.230> kill<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:33.829> anyway

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
not gonna be able to kill it so anyway

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.559 
not gonna be able to kill it so anyway
I'm<00:02:34.159> going<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.370> come<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:34.909> here<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.120> build<00:02:35.329> two

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
I'm going to come up here and build two

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.020 
I'm going to come up here and build two
more<00:02:35.599> cannons<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.379> his<00:02:37.129> base<00:02:37.370> they<00:02:37.670> are<00:02:37.700> being

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
more cannons in his base they are being

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.879 
more cannons in his base they are being
powered<00:02:38.329> by<00:02:38.389> the<00:02:38.510> pylon<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.530> low<00:02:39.680> ground

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
powered by the pylon and the low ground

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.030 
powered by the pylon and the low ground
there<00:02:40.189> as<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.879> can<00:02:41.000> see<00:02:41.439> and<00:02:42.439> then<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.920> to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
there as you can see and then going to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
there as you can see and then going to
build<00:02:43.189> a<00:02:43.280> pile<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.670> over<00:02:43.909> there<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.299> he<00:02:45.139> has

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
build a pile on over there and he has

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.199 
build a pile on over there and he has
got<00:02:45.439> 10<00:02:45.859> out<00:02:46.069> he<00:02:46.250> very<00:02:46.459> cleverly<00:02:46.790> threw<00:02:47.030> down<00:02:47.150> a

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
got 10 out he very cleverly threw down a

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.080 
got 10 out he very cleverly threw down a
second<00:02:47.569> gateway<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:48.500> lot<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.430> times<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:49.909> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
second gateway a lot of times what you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.280 
second gateway a lot of times what you
should<00:02:50.299> do<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.569> actually<00:02:50.720> throw<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.049> on<00:02:51.139> your

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
should do is actually throw it on your

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.780 
should do is actually throw it on your
own<00:02:51.319> forge<00:02:51.799> when<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.129> see<00:02:52.280> him<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.549> for<00:02:52.639> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
own forge when you see him going for a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.909 
own forge when you see him going for a
cannon<00:02:53.060> rush<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:54.019> he<00:02:54.049> decides<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.650> throw<00:02:54.709> it

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
cannon rush but he decides to throw it

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.960 
cannon rush but he decides to throw it
on<00:02:55.010> second<00:02:55.310> gate<00:02:55.430> where<00:02:55.609> he<00:02:55.669> thinks<00:02:55.760> he<00:02:55.939> can

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
on second gate where he thinks he can

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.399 
on second gate where he thinks he can
maybe<00:02:56.209> hold<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.599> off<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.109> sell<00:02:57.260> off

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
maybe hold it off with just sell off

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.319 
maybe hold it off with just sell off

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
he's going to be attacking this pile on

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.229 
he's going to be attacking this pile on
here<00:02:59.599> and<00:03:00.219> that's<00:03:01.219> a<00:03:01.310> very<00:03:01.519> bad<00:03:01.639> movie<00:03:02.030> should

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
here and that's a very bad movie should

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.550 
here and that's a very bad movie should
have<00:03:02.329> actually<00:03:02.599> moved<00:03:02.719> that<00:03:02.870> cell<00:03:03.079> around<00:03:03.379> to

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
have actually moved that cell around to

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.080 
have actually moved that cell around to
tack<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.799> other<00:03:04.069> pile<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.909> now<00:03:05.030> he

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

trouble he's going to bring all his

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.099 
trouble he's going to bring all his
probes<00:03:08.030> off<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.329> line<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.659> try<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.870> destroy

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
probes off the line to try and destroy

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.830 
probes off the line to try and destroy
this<00:03:09.230> cannons<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.239> another<00:03:11.239> thing<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.689> have

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
this cannons and another thing you have

this cannons and another thing you have
to<00:03:11.870> watch<00:03:12.049> out<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.469> keeping<00:03:12.769> your<00:03:12.889> probe

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
to watch out for is keeping your probe

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.830 
to watch out for is keeping your probe
alive<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.579> his<00:03:13.700> base<00:03:13.909> that<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.599> most

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
alive in his base that is the most

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.149 
alive in his base that is the most
important<00:03:15.379> thing<00:03:15.530> when<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.799> comes<00:03:15.980> down<00:03:16.099> to

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
important thing when it comes down to

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.589 
important thing when it comes down to

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
cannon rush you have to keep a probe

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.869 
cannon rush you have to keep a probe
alive<00:03:17.900> always<00:03:18.769> keep<00:03:18.949> moving<00:03:19.310> around<00:03:19.370> hide<00:03:19.729> it

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
alive always keep moving around hide it

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.189 
alive always keep moving around hide it
behind<00:03:20.000> your<00:03:20.150> cannons<00:03:20.479> do<00:03:20.599> not<00:03:20.750> let<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.019> die

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
behind your cannons do not let it die

behind your cannons do not let it die
even<00:03:21.470> if<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:21.859> run<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.129> out<00:03:22.250> out<00:03:22.699> of

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
even if you have to run it out out of

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.300 
even if you have to run it out out of
his<00:03:23.419> base<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:24.560> anyway<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.829> can<00:03:24.949> see<00:03:25.099> here

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
his base but anyway you can see here

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.099 
his base but anyway you can see here
he's<00:03:25.459> got<00:03:25.609> nothing<00:03:25.909> left<00:03:26.030> all<00:03:26.720> his<00:03:26.810> probes

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
he's got nothing left all his probes

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.559 
he's got nothing left all his probes
would<00:03:27.290> kill<00:03:27.500> by<00:03:27.590> my<00:03:27.739> cannons<00:03:28.299> my<00:03:29.299> progress

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
would kill by my cannons my progress

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.719 
would kill by my cannons my progress
here<00:03:29.870> walking<00:03:30.229> in<00:03:30.290> more<00:03:30.470> cannons<00:03:30.859> I've<00:03:31.549> never

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:31.729 
here walking in more cannons I've never

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.099 
here walking in more cannons I've never
need<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.060> at<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.299> point<00:03:32.449> because<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> game

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
need to at this point because the game

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.020 
need to at this point because the game
is<00:03:33.229> pretty<00:03:33.379> much<00:03:33.560> over<00:03:33.739> drug<00:03:34.489> sales<00:03:34.819> coming

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
is pretty much over drug sales coming

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.640 
is pretty much over drug sales coming
out<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.299> it's<00:03:35.449> not<00:03:35.569> enough<00:03:35.659> he's<00:03:36.290> got<00:03:36.470> one

out but it's not enough he's got one

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.689 
out but it's not enough he's got one
probe<00:03:36.949> mining<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:39.250> yeah<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.549> pretty

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
probe mining and and yeah this is pretty

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.890 
probe mining and and yeah this is pretty
much<00:03:40.909> game

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.390 

so<00:03:44.900> yeah<00:03:45.050> keep<00:03:45.290> always<00:03:45.500> keep<00:03:45.740> appropriate<00:03:46.250> in

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
his face build a pile on the low ground

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.809 
his face build a pile on the low ground
and<00:03:48.530> build<00:03:48.739> one<00:03:48.950> cannon<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.520> low<00:03:49.580> ground

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
and build one cannon on the low ground

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.479 
and build one cannon on the low ground
as<00:03:49.970> well<00:03:50.120> he<00:03:50.300> says<00:03:50.480> chichi<00:03:50.959> there<00:03:51.400> what<00:03:52.400> you

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
as well he says chichi there what you

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.309 
as well he says chichi there what you
can<00:03:52.610> also<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:53.000> with<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.239> one<00:03:53.510> as<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:54.080> can<00:03:54.200> see

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
can also do with this one as you can see

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.050 
can also do with this one as you can see
my<00:03:54.440> one<00:03:54.620> can<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.130> low<00:03:55.280> ground<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.910> can

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
my one can on the low ground you can

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.760 
my one can on the low ground you can
actually<00:03:56.300> build<00:03:56.450> pylons<00:03:56.959> around<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> cannon

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
actually build pylons around that cannon

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.090 
actually build pylons around that cannon
and<00:03:57.920> wall<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.280> off<00:03:58.400> with<00:03:58.640> pylons<00:03:59.090> which<00:04:00.100> is

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
and wall it off with pylons which is

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.320 
and wall it off with pylons which is
also<00:04:01.430> very<00:04:01.550> nice<00:04:01.700> because<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.120> can't

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
also very nice because then you can't

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.760 
also very nice because then you can't
send<00:04:02.540> units<00:04:02.870> down<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.350> low<00:04:03.440> ground<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
send units down to the low ground to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.990 
send units down to the low ground to
pick<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.040> off<00:04:04.100> anyway<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.489> hope<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.790> guys

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
pick it off anyway I hope you guys
