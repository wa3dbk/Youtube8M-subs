those shallow read call it follow the

those shallow read call it follow the
play<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.220> got<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.690> last<00:00:09.960> season<00:00:10.200> from

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
play I got from this last season from

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.759 
play I got from this last season from
the<00:00:10.830> University<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.820> Houston<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> great

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the University of Houston it's a great

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.000 
the University of Houston it's a great
play<00:00:14.089> working<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> high-low<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.010> outside

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
play working the high-low on the outside

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.830 
play working the high-low on the outside
linebacker<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> kind<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.690> off<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
linebacker but it's a kind of off the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.660 
linebacker but it's a kind of off the
scat<00:00:19.939> system<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:22.590> reason<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.949> put<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.250> here

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
scat system and the reason I put it here

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
scat system and the reason I put it here
because<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.210> definite<00:00:24.779> high-low<00:00:25.199> read<00:00:25.470> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because it's a definite high-low read on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.509 
because it's a definite high-low read on
the<00:00:27.199> outside<00:00:28.199> linebacker<00:00:28.650> where<00:00:28.890> skat<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the outside linebacker where skat is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.620 
the outside linebacker where skat is
more<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> triangle<00:00:30.240> read<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:32.360> we<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
more of a triangle read and so we put it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
more of a triangle read and so we put it
part<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.050> system<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.620> basically

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
part of this system because basically

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
part of this system because basically
the<00:00:35.610> quarterbacks<00:00:35.969> still<00:00:36.210> looking<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the quarterbacks still looking at a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
the quarterbacks still looking at a
high-low<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.579> linebacker<00:00:38.730> outside

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
high-low on the will linebacker outside

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
high-low on the will linebacker outside
linebacker<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.170> button<00:00:41.129> coming<00:00:41.280> from

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
linebacker and button coming from

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.590 
linebacker and button coming from
different<00:00:41.640> areas<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> little<00:00:42.510> bit

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
different areas so it's a little bit

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.639 
different areas so it's a little bit
different<00:00:42.899> than<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.280> shallow<00:00:44.280> Drive<00:00:44.969> dig

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
different than the shallow Drive dig

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
different than the shallow Drive dig
type<00:00:46.649> series<00:00:47.239> because<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
type series because it is from a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.130 
type series because it is from a
different<00:00:49.020> play<00:00:49.260> type<00:00:49.559> scenario<00:00:51.140> alignment

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
different play type scenario alignment

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
different play type scenario alignment
he<00:00:52.320> lines<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> scat<00:00:53.640> or

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
he lines up just like they do a scat or

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
he lines up just like they do a scat or

to be five yards for him and other side

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
to be five yards for him and other side
it<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.510> doesn't<00:01:04.290> matter<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it just doesn't matter because this is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.230 
it just doesn't matter because this is
just<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> half-filled<00:01:05.460> concept<00:01:06.030> where<00:01:06.150> the

that he runs on shallower and stuff and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.679 
that he runs on shallower and stuff and
but<00:01:38.220> he<00:01:38.280> has<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.579> options<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.540> he

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
but he has some options also where he

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.020 
but he has some options also where he

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
can sit in the hole in and run post so a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420 
can sit in the hole in and run post so a
little<00:01:42.329> bit<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.509> options<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> route<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
little bit more options on this route a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
little bit more options on this route a
little<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:44.909> more<00:01:45.890> all-inclusive<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
little bit more all-inclusive on the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
little bit more all-inclusive on the
type<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:48.259> but<00:01:49.259> definitely<00:01:49.710> takes<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> lot

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
type of play but definitely takes a lot

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
type of play but definitely takes a lot
of<00:01:50.280> practice<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> takes<00:01:51.509> two<00:01:51.689> good

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of practice time and it takes two good

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.850 
of practice time and it takes two good
receivers<00:01:52.290> who<00:01:52.380> knows<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.680> they're<00:01:52.829> doing

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
many play variations like I said it's a

many play variations like I said it's a
really<00:04:55.830> advanced<00:04:56.130> play<00:04:56.490> we<00:04:56.880> try<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.270> stay

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
really advanced play we try to just stay

really advanced play we try to just stay
with<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.690> try<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.170> keep<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.470> two-man<00:04:58.860> type

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
with that try to keep a two-man type

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.150 
with that try to keep a two-man type
thing<00:05:00.090> it's<00:05:00.330> something<00:05:00.720> maybe<00:05:01.080> your<00:05:01.800> receiver

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
thing it's something maybe your receiver

coach<00:05:02.400> can<00:05:02.700> work<00:05:02.880> with<00:05:03.060> them<00:05:03.180> after<00:05:03.630> practice

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
coach can work with them after practice

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.350 
coach can work with them after practice
and<00:05:04.350> they<00:05:04.920> can<00:05:05.070> work<00:05:05.220> on<00:05:05.400> different<00:05:05.670> scenarios

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
and they can work on different scenarios

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.540 
and they can work on different scenarios
and<00:05:06.570> stuff<00:05:06.750> like<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.110> like<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.160> said<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:08.460> an

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
and stuff like that like I said it's an

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.190 
and stuff like that like I said it's an
advanced<00:05:08.820> play<00:05:09.180> so<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:09.480> really<00:05:09.780> don't<00:05:09.870> really

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
advanced play so we really don't really
