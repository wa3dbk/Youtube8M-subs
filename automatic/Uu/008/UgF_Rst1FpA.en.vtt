within<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.710> jacket<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:09.360> futsal

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
within your jacket I think futsal

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
within your jacket I think futsal
improves<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.710> skills<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
improves my skills because you have to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.550 
improves my skills because you have to
think<00:01:13.049> fast<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.439> small

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
think fast and it's like it it's a small

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.480 
think fast and it's like it it's a small
card<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.700> have<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:21.000> speed

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
card so you need to like have more speed

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.830 
card so you need to like have more speed
I'm<00:01:23.490> different<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> other<00:01:24.509> place

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm different from the other place

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
I'm different from the other place
because<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.470> thinking<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.280> passing<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
because of my thinking and my passing of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
because of my thinking and my passing of
the<00:01:27.000> ball<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:28.140> makes<00:01:28.799> me<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> better<00:01:29.430> player

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the ball what makes me a better player

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
the ball what makes me a better player
because<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.290> faster<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
because you have to think faster and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
because you have to think faster and
move<00:01:32.340> quicker<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> other

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
move quicker like all the other

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.609 
move quicker like all the other
countries<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> world

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
countries in the world

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
countries in the world
you<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.430> fields<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.270> over<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you see fields like this all over the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789 
you see fields like this all over the
place<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> doesn't<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
place and it doesn't have to be this

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
place and it doesn't have to be this
this<00:01:38.460> size<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.420> bit<00:01:39.630> bigger

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this size it can be a little bit bigger

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810 
this size it can be a little bit bigger
it<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.530> smaller<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.040> when

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it can be a little bit smaller but when
