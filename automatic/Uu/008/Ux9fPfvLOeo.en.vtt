called
converter<00:00:16.290> which<00:00:17.280> obviously<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.330> just

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
converter which obviously is just

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.240 
converter which obviously is just
converts<00:00:19.530> units<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:21.620> quicken<00:00:22.620> things<00:00:22.950> so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
converts units from quicken things so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.210 
converts units from quicken things so
it's<00:00:23.869> really<00:00:24.869> useful<00:00:25.140> app<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.680> mean<00:00:25.860> if<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it's really useful app I mean if this

what you have you have a normal
calculator<00:00:44.340> sort<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.670> layout<00:00:44.910> where<00:00:45.060> you<00:00:45.180> just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
calculator sort of layout where you just

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810 
calculator sort of layout where you just
enter<00:00:45.660> unit<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> they're<00:00:47.430> instantly

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
enter unit and they're instantly

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.730 
enter unit and they're instantly
converted<00:00:48.240> right<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.440> set<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
converted right now I have it set to

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.820 
converted right now I have it set to
convert<00:00:50.220> from<00:00:50.340> HS<00:00:50.700> defeat<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.710> can

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
convert from HS defeat and as you can

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.740 
convert from HS defeat and as you can
see<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.040> down<00:00:53.220> here<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.610> also<00:00:53.790> have<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.540> in

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
see it down here you also have just in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.240 
see it down here you also have just in
written<00:00:55.050> format<00:00:55.880> 7855<00:00:56.880> 70,000<00:00:57.690> inches<00:00:58.020> equals

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
written format 7855 70,000 inches equals

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070 
written format 7855 70,000 inches equals
however<00:00:59.250> many<00:00:59.400> feet<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.330> we'll<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.810> take<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
however many feet so we'll just take a

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.219 
however many feet so we'll just take a
look<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.380> what<00:01:01.410> conversions<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.430> possible

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
look at what conversions are possible

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.920 
look at what conversions are possible
what<00:01:04.229> units<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:05.100> covered<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.659> amount<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
what units are covered and the amount of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
what units are covered and the amount of
conversions<00:01:07.740> possible<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> frankly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
conversions possible is frankly

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.109 
conversions possible is frankly
ridiculous<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:11.210> metric<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:14.119> forgot

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
ridiculous you have metric and forgot

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
ridiculous you have metric and forgot
other<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.570> imperial<00:01:16.470> metric<00:01:16.860> systems

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
other one is imperial metric systems
