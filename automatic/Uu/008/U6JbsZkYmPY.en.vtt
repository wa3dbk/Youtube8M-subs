 Yamaha Motor's SCARA robot robot vision 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.690
 Introducing id system 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:50.690
 SCARA robot boasts a rich lineup of the top in the industry 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:56.650
 And robot vision that can be easily used by anyone and greatly contributes to man-hour reduction 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.650
 id system We introduce these two bottom products 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.730
 Was 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:12.570
 First of all, let us introduce the superior performance of SCARA robots 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:14.250
 Yamaha SCARA robot is completely beltless with zr axis direct coupling structure 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 Realize the structure 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.700
 This will greatly reduce the lost king and over the long term 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.700
 I can maintain the legal system 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:32.480
 Also, there is no concern about belt breakage or day- old deterioration. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.480
 You can use maintenance-free over between the above-mentioned 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 In addition, the small-size medium-sized model has long-life grease as the sun 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.869
 There is no need for gear disassembly for grease replacement 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 Do not worry about, such as misalignment due to decomposition 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 In addition, all SCARA robots from Yamaha are directly connected to the tip end of the reduction gear and it is surprising 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 r Axes yaw moment of inertia realized 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.910
 Insistence or Insistence 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:18.420
 Therefore , compared to the general verdo structure from the nest 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 It enables high positioning accuracy and high-speed operation even for a work piece or a work with a large offset. 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.750
 Better was 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:34.049
 Of course, the position detector of the motor similar other yamaha robot 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.049
 It offers superior resolver resistance to environmental performance 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:47.210
 Resolvers are generally adopted with a simple structure without page parts and optical elements 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:54.640
 Fewer potential failures compared to optical encoders 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.640
 Stable position detection is possible even in a bad environment such as mist and dust 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.269
 Next, yamaha robot vision Ivy system superior performance 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.269
 I will introduce 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:25.020
 The id system makes it easy to register work that was complicated up to now in 3 steps 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.540
 In addition, work can be added easily 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.540
 Up to 40 types can be registered 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:40.820
 As a step, first capture the image of the work 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.820
 Set a unit and set parameters as needed 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:58.140
 Then out of the auto-detected contour 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.140
 Fill in the part you want to use with the tool and set the outline 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.730
 Hmm 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.239
 Finally 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.239
 It is an easy operation of specifying and registering the work detection position 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:25.470
 When using a conventional vision system 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:31.770
 Because the format differs between robot coordinate data and vision, the robot 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.590
 I had to create a coordinate conversion program on the controller but 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.530
 Oh Yamaha 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:41.380
 b If the system is integrated with a controller, processing is performed once for point data of the robot 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:47.950
 Very easy to store 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:53.550
 Easy to understand because camera control and lighting control can be controlled collectively by robot program 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.550
 It leads to the reduction of the start-up time and the cost reduction 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:04.389
 Also, the traditional vision system was complicated and time-consuming 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:11.139
 Calibration work even if Yamaha Ivy system 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:12.350
 Operate in accordance with the interactive instructions in the programming box, simply and quickly 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.160
 Complete 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.650
 Hmm 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:25.490
 Camera attachment for the controller to automatically convert the calibration data 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.490
 You can work without any trouble without worrying about the method 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:39.160
 Take advantage of such performance 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:45.030
 Your environment if Yamaha SCARA robot robot vision system id 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.030
 It is possible to correspond to the application that meets the demand 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.689
 3 types 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.560
 dj 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.210
 mem 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:09.860
 In pursuit of superior performance and ease of use 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:12.280
 Try the Yamaha SCARA Robot robot vision Ivy System 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.280
 Please give me 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.620
 Yeah yeah yeah
