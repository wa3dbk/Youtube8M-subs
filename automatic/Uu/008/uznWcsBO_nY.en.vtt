00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.869
 South Africa did 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.459
 proof of his ability to organize the 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.320
 an international sports competition 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.970
 no attempt at any violent demonstration of his income 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.789
 finally at home this great sporting event 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.509
 nevertheless I would say that it is a victory at the Swiss pyrrhus 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.089
 because the cost to south africa of organizing this world cup 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.350
 of football 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.640
 and draw around 3 23 billion euros 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.380
 that is to say, approximately with 4 April 5% of the country's GNP 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.000
 and most municipalities and the place will not be able to assume the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.510
 maintenance fees 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930
 built infrastructure 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.800
 for example large stadium near johannesbourg that was redeveloped 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 for the world cup tonight city 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.739
 at a capacity of 94000 places that is to say superior 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.110
 our stadium of france 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.420
 finally on the political level it is regrettable to note that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.120
 a large part of the public contracts related to the organization of this cut of the 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.840
 world 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.140
 in February and malfeasance and corruption 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 or misappropriation of public funds 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.909
 South Africa I would say that a paradoxical power 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 and even in some ways a little disconcerting 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 indeed south africa we need occitan the european union or the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.579
 United States 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330
 is among the first investors 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.350
 and the first trading partners of the countries 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.430
 similarly south africa is getting closer 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 non-democratic standards 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 south africa and then democracy sometimes that's right 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.760
 who not always exemplary but m 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.810
 we have prescribed free unions that are powerful and representative 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.659
 cartoonists I think especially that sometimes go back without 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.100
 preference to power 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 yet no South Africa it's true 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.280
 to a foreign policy that is often criticized or even vilified 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919
 Western world 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.840
 for how much to understand it you must have in mind 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.760
 of South African diplomacy remains impregnated by ideology of ssi 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:22.899
 the idea from 1994 defended by nelson mandela then thabo mbÃ©ki 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.310
 was one of the rewards ideas and support all states have had 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.689
 government political movements 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.759
 who raised contribute 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.219
 the fight of the black people 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.249
 hence their relatively close relationship 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.339
 between south africa and cuba 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:42.249
 between south africa and the lybie the steel mill or of course bezina 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.549
 pothier 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.189
 but he noted for example during the investiture of President soumahoro 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.840
 last year Colonel Gaddafi were present 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.649
 just like robert our crap 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.389
 and the first trip I recently debated after his release outside 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.779
 from the African continent 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.469
 arrested in cuba 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.049
 so I think that after this football world cup the president oumar 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.479
 will have to truly clarify 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.829
 the axes of this diplomacy 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.899
 South Africa can not pretend 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.969
 petroleum big power four members of the g20 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.429
 and at the same time refuse a visa for the Dalai Lama 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.429
 or do not condemn the repression carried out by the Burmese junta 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.949
 especially in September 2008 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.359
 In the first place, it is important to bear in mind the extent of violence in 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.849
 South Africa 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.369
 a few figures each year are to be deplored since 1997 to 2009 thanks to 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.459
 site 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.609
 comparison patoux in the united states while the population is 6 times 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:41.809
 higher 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.129
 we deplore nearly 17 9 pts at six months each year 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.559
 the number of rapes in any case the complaints filed it must take the 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.529
 ball will probably go by year 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.060
 by this violence it's sad stressed 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.959
 it's true it's mostly developed grew after the end of 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.949
 apartheid 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.059
 what are the explanatory factors 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.099
 for first elements there is the very high number of firearms in 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.559
 traffic 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:09.680
 because most neighboring bordering countries of south africa like angola 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:13.059
 mozambique then south dg I'm not moved 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.349
 we have known wars of decolonization extremely 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.519
 sears then been resold in south africa 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.349
 second explanation south africa even 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.800
 has been the scene of very violent conflicts I think in particular the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.580
 KwaZulu-Natal Province 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.349
 which was the scene of clashes between the knees 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.619
 and then, and that's during the year 1999 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.259
 third important point it's true that there are a number of aliens and 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
 illegal immigrants from south africa 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.740
 the figure by definition is very difficult and will rise between 4 and 6 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.830
 million 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.520
 of illegal immigrants 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.970
 heyer unfortunately these people very often have no other choice 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.560
 to survive that to engage in violent criminal acts 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.050
 but I add ray as an explanatory factor of other points that are all 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.580
 as important 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.730
 first in the early years of democracy and justice has shown 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 a certain leniency advocating national reconciliation 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.319
 but mostly corrupt police 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.319
 she is convinced because agents are low paid 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.240
 she is convinced because massive recruitment 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.009
 was carried out and often these police officers alive and well township 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.430
 that the people who are supposed to stop 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.650
 to violence and this is true one of the main concerns of 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.360
 South African with avoidance the economic crisis 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.759
 so to finish I'll just say that 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.150
 after this football world cup 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.319
 the coming of the award of the man of the year 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.710
 it's a positive evolution means a bit like Brazil 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.219
 that is to say, a society that becomes more and more mixed 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.780
 and for him and for the economic and financial inequalities is reabsorbed 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.749
 slowly but this reasoning 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.259
 the other hypothesis is to think that 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.490
 because of the economical crisis 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.660
 ako it's true racial tensions and well the evolution of south africa 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.059
 will be rather close to this one has moved 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:09.439
 that is, a power that becomes autocratic 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.719
 an elite essentially European today 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.629
 who unfortunately chooses to leave
