another<00:00:06.589> phantasmagorical<00:00:07.589> gameplay<00:00:07.980> plan

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
another phantasmagorical gameplay plan

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.919 
another phantasmagorical gameplay plan
some<00:00:08.910> strike<00:00:09.210> zone<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.550> p226<00:00:11.929> pistol

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
some strike zone with the p226 pistol

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.880 
some strike zone with the p226 pistol
and<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.920> drop<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.429> kem<00:00:14.910> strike<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.500> start<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and I drop a kem strike and the start of

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.620 
and I drop a kem strike and the start of
this<00:00:17.010> gameplay<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.300> quite

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
this gameplay is actually really quite

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.410 
this gameplay is actually really quite
fairly<00:00:19.529> fast<00:00:19.890> paced<00:00:20.189> i<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.820> pretty<00:00:21.060> well<00:00:21.180> at

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
fairly fast paced i do pretty well at

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109 
fairly fast paced i do pretty well at
the<00:00:21.510> start<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.560> um<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.820> slows

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the start and then um it really slows

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.859 
the start and then um it really slows
down<00:00:24.359> no<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.779> no<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.260> stays<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
down no one no one stays in the game and

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.589 
down no one no one stays in the game and
so<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.349> kind<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.099> sped<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> cut<00:00:30.480> out

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
so I kind of like sped it up and cut out

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.440 
so I kind of like sped it up and cut out
a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.840> i<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.470> 100%<00:00:32.309> short<00:00:32.790> i<00:00:32.910> did<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.390> i

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
a bit i think i 100% short i did but i

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.970 
a bit i think i 100% short i did but i
think<00:00:33.660> i<00:00:33.719> sped<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.410> point<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.270> um<00:00:36.270> i

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
think i sped it up at one point and um i

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.340 
think i sped it up at one point and um i
think<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.460> 20<00:00:39.210> kills<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.840> took<00:00:39.899> me

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
think the first 20 kills or so took me

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
think the first 20 kills or so took me
like<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:41.129> minutes<00:00:41.370> maybe<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:41.969> more

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
like three minutes maybe a bit more

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.560 
like three minutes maybe a bit more
maybe<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.420> bit<00:00:42.570> less<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:43.440> um<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
maybe a bit less pretty bit more um and

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
maybe a bit less pretty bit more um and
the<00:00:45.570> last<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.110> four<00:00:46.500> kills<00:00:46.860> took<00:00:47.190> me<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the last like four kills took me like

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.369 
the last like four kills took me like
over<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.930> minutes<00:00:49.110> were<00:00:49.590> saying<00:00:49.800> life<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
over two minutes were saying life out so

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
over two minutes were saying life out so
that<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.590> shows<00:00:52.649> pretty<00:00:53.129> much<00:00:53.309> how<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.940> slow

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that just shows pretty much how a slow

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
that just shows pretty much how a slow
pace<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.500> didn't<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> move

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
pace it got I didn't really want to move

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
pace it got I didn't really want to move
out<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> B<00:00:57.120> flag<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.350> most<00:00:58.620> close

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
out of B flag because that's most close

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.569 
out of B flag because that's most close
close<00:01:00.059> pace<00:01:01.039> engagements<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.190> could<00:01:02.399> get

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
close pace engagements that I could get

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.649 
close pace engagements that I could get
into<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:04.880> well<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> didn't<00:01:06.330> really<00:01:06.360> want<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
into and well I didn't really want to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
into and well I didn't really want to
move<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.990> otherwise<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.500> gets<00:01:07.590> shot<00:01:07.920> from

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
move that otherwise it gets shot from

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000 
move that otherwise it gets shot from
like<00:01:08.280> an<00:01:08.400> assault<00:01:08.700> rifle<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.270> sniper<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:10.110> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
like an assault rifle or a sniper or so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
like an assault rifle or a sniper or so
I<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.340> order<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.090> better<00:01:12.780> gun<00:01:13.049> for

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I that order just a a better gun for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
I that order just a a better gun for
those<00:01:13.500> type<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.799> engagements<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
those type of engagements because a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
those type of engagements because a
pistol<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.720> those<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
pistol is not good for those kind of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
pistol is not good for those kind of
engagements<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.100> he<00:01:17.280> didn't<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.700> already

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
engagements if he didn't know already

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.390 
engagements if he didn't know already
and<00:01:18.890> yeah<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.509> pretty<00:01:21.509> good<00:01:21.570> gameplay

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
and yeah so pretty good gameplay

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.210 
and yeah so pretty good gameplay
hopefully<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> guys<00:01:23.580> will<00:01:24.090> drop<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
hopefully you guys will drop a like and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.890 
hopefully you guys will drop a like and
let's<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:26.549> into<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> topic<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.810> guessed<00:01:28.290> so

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
let's move into the topic I guessed so

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.890 
let's move into the topic I guessed so
today's<00:01:30.900> topic<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.900> game

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
today's topic is going to be game

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.469 
today's topic is going to be game
balancing<00:01:34.790> now<00:01:36.799> it's<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.210> really<00:01:39.210> sad

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
balancing now it's really really sad
