beater tan and so what I do is I wear
bikini<00:00:37.469> tops<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> bikini<00:00:38.640> top<00:00:38.730> 10

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

be<00:00:42.600> wearing<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.340> that<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
be wearing that that one because it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
be wearing that that one because it
doesn't<00:00:45.450> provide<00:00:45.750> enough<00:00:45.780> coverage<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.649> me

when I wear this and so I haven't had

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
when I wear this and so I haven't had
any<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> issues<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.460> dating<00:00:50.700> two

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you're going to be sweating so much

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
you're going to be sweating so much
wearing<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.000> literally<00:01:03.000> every<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

like<00:07:02.710> I<00:07:02.890> honestly<00:07:03.400> just<00:07:03.460> feel<00:07:03.880> like<00:07:04.030> it's<00:07:04.240> just

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
like I honestly just feel like it's just

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.260 
like I honestly just feel like it's just
lack<00:07:05.650> of<00:07:05.830> knowledge<00:07:06.040> of<00:07:06.490> knowing<00:07:06.970> what's

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
lack of knowledge of knowing what's

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.720 
lack of knowledge of knowing what's
actually<00:07:07.510> occurring<00:07:07.720> I<00:07:08.260> agree<00:07:09.100> that<00:07:09.400> there

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
actually occurring I agree that there

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.970 
actually occurring I agree that there
are<00:07:09.910> situations<00:07:10.240> where<00:07:10.960> that<00:07:11.350> can't<00:07:11.710> happen

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980
