00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 Welcome to my channel this time 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.900
 I'm going to show you how I prepare some 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.900
 zucchini with cheese and then we occupy 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.060
 of course there are some zucchini 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 either the ones that you want to do 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 we are going to do right here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.170
 five then we also occupy 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.019
 Butter 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.649
 a teaspoon of pepper one 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:47.609
 tablespoon chicken broth half 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:51.180
 can of corn onion tomato and a 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.570
 can of tomato sauce or sauce 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.119
 puree and we also need the cheese the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.750
 cheese can be a monterrey since the 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:03.089
 melted cheese we take care of that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.869
 cheese then so we're going to 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.030
 start 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.570
 now we apply our 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 vegetable 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.070
 and all our vegetables to be able to add 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.070
 the all to our house 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.719
 to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810
 i 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.660
 although we already put all the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.200
 ingredients that I mentioned to you that res 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.730
 corn squash onion tomato 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.980
 the sauce the consommÃ© and the butter 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.489
 Now what is going to do is get to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.160
 fire well low for 15 minutes covered 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.040
 is to be done more like steam 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.340
 the pumpkins already after they pass 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.200
 about 15 minutes you have to check and so 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.690
 we see that our zucchini are 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.180
 soft you have to taste them 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.640
 to say lack some salt 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.560
 and if you already look at what is fine 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 let's just do it is put the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.170
 cheese over and we're going to pay him what 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.439
 let's leave it covered for a little while 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.250
 but already with the fire extinguished already passed 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:14.280
 15 minutes and so they are this way 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.110
 in quite the liquid and right now we are going to 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.110
 put some cheese 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.070
 since that is because it is to taste, that is, there is no 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.050
 as you tell them of measures because if 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.920
 they like enough cheese they can put 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.090
 not much 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.050
 to your liking 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.940
 for this is already had to prove 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.160
 salt that was good and all the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.120
 zucchini are already many squash 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.540
 moms we're going to go to put out the fire and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.610
 already to cover and reserve for a while and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.220
 now in this part is the result of 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.450
 how we left our zucchini 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.769
 with cheese on this occasion and I am 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.430
 accompanying with a little rice 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.340
 red or rice and rice soup 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.000
 and as they saw it is a very 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.000
 healthy 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.350
 I hope you liked my way of 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.020

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.050
