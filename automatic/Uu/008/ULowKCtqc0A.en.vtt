00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.710 

you<00:01:11.760> might<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.270> weird<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you might think it's weird that the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.929

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
set that way for a reason because when

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.219 
set that way for a reason because when
say<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.470> light<00:01:25.470> shining<00:01:25.950> somewhere

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229

the tactical flashlights on at night

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.210 
the tactical flashlights on at night
move<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.340> go

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.320 

you<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.520> able<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:40.040> directly

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
you want to be able to see directly

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.320 
you want to be able to see directly
where<00:01:42.330> your<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.790> because<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
where your point do that because the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.900 
where your point do that because the
firefights<00:01:45.720> offset<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.350> bit<00:01:46.620> so<00:01:46.910> by

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
firefights offset a little bit so by

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.020 
firefights offset a little bit so by
putting<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.690> scope<00:01:49.200> offset<00:01:54.530> pretty<00:01:55.530> much

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
putting the scope offset pretty much

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:05.960 
putting the scope offset pretty much
good<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> go<00:02:03.979> another<00:02:04.979> reason<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.520> scope<00:02:05.760> is

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
good to go another reason the scope is

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.229 
good to go another reason the scope is
set<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.440> was<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.790> personal

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
set like this was for a personal

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.110 
set like this was for a personal
preference<00:02:09.770> also<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.070> also<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.700> noted<00:02:12.030> in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
preference also that also was noted in
