it's incredible that we are able to
advance<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.730> level<00:02:27.090> where<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.750> are

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
advance to that level where we are

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.620 
advance to that level where we are
enclosing<00:02:28.470> more<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.010> more<00:02:29.190> space<00:02:29.630> for

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
enclosing more and more space for

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.870 
enclosing more and more space for
example<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.200> year<00:02:31.560> alone<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.340> were<00:02:32.489> able<00:02:32.850> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
example this year alone we were able to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.780 
example this year alone we were able to
move<00:02:33.600> toward<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> next<00:02:34.500> stage<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.950> planting

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
move toward the next stage of planting

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
move toward the next stage of planting
our<00:02:36.590> our<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:38.700> group<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.060> trees<00:02:39.330> mulberry

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
our our one group of trees mulberry

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.730 
our our one group of trees mulberry
trees<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.590> were<00:02:40.680> 10,000

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
trees there were 10,000

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.880 
trees there were 10,000
them<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.490> 10,000<00:02:43.300> mulberry<00:02:43.690> trees<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.530> one
