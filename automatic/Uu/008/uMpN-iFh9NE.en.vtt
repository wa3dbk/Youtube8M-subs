most<00:01:42.420> important<00:01:42.899> thing<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.170> doing<00:01:43.290> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
most important thing we're doing this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.749 
most important thing we're doing this
this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> do

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
this is what we're going to have to do

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
this is what we're going to have to do
is<00:01:44.880> heat<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.390> goal<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> thousand

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is heat up this goal to about a thousand

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.710 
is heat up this goal to about a thousand
things<00:01:46.890> about<00:01:47.280> thousand<00:01:47.759> sixty<00:01:48.180> degrees<00:01:48.509> it's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
things about thousand sixty degrees it's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.740 
things about thousand sixty degrees it's
really<00:01:49.140> hot<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> temperature<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.659> which

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
really hot and the temperature at which

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.819 
really hot and the temperature at which
gold<00:01:52.079> melts<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:54.149> pure<00:01:54.420> gold<00:01:54.649> melts<00:01:55.649> at<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
gold melts is with pure gold melts at a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
gold melts is with pure gold melts at a
very<00:01:56.070> high<00:01:56.310> temperature<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> melts<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.329> about

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
very high temperature and melts at about

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
very high temperature and melts at about
a<00:01:57.600> thousand<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.320> sixty<00:01:58.770> something<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a thousand and sixty something that but

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.170 
a thousand and sixty something that but
then<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.479> less<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.649> less<00:02:01.770> pure<00:02:02.100> gold<00:02:02.399> melts<00:02:03.030> at

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
then a less and less pure gold melts at

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
then a less and less pure gold melts at
lower<00:02:03.360> temperatures<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.380> you've<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

is 24 karat gold but if you've got 9
karat<00:02:07.740> gold<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.190> melt<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> lower

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
karat gold it will melt at a lower

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.290

temperature you've got 18 karat gold
about<00:02:11.480> somewhere<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.870> between<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.550> let's<00:02:13.550> have

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
about somewhere in between so let's have

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.850 
about somewhere in between so let's have
a<00:02:13.760> go<00:02:15.640> safety<00:02:16.640> goggles

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860

you<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.040> light<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> butane<00:02:23.090> torch<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.870> quite

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
you can light a butane torch you quite

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.060 
you can light a butane torch you quite
easy<00:02:25.010> with<00:02:25.250> matches<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.590> butane<00:02:27.590> torch<00:02:27.830> is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
easy with matches and butane torch is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.610 
easy with matches and butane torch is
what<00:02:28.220> jewelers<00:02:28.850> use<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.630> for<00:02:29.960> melting<00:02:30.350> gold

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
what jewelers use for for melting gold

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.950 
what jewelers use for for melting gold
or<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.950> other<00:02:33.950> types<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.400> torches<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.360> it's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
or and other types of torches so it's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.290 
or and other types of torches so it's
like<00:02:36.200> torch

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.510 

you<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.320> see<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.100 

you<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.670> hear<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.270> torch<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.780> hear<00:02:51.960> that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
you can hear the torch we can hear that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.050 
you can hear the torch we can hear that
it's<00:02:52.290> working<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.460> see<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.790> there's<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
it's working you can see that there's a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
it's working you can see that there's a
flame<00:02:56.090> let's<00:02:57.090> make<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.330> hot<00:03:00.800> okay<00:03:01.830> mustn't

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
flame let's make it hot okay mustn't

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.410 
flame let's make it hot okay mustn't
touch<00:03:02.280> any<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.000> hands<00:03:03.330> you

touch any of this with your hands you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.660 
touch any of this with your hands you
need<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.880> tongs<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.240> this<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.520> I'm

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
need to have tongs like this and all I'm

need to have tongs like this and all I'm
going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.820> do<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.060> quite<00:03:09.240> simple<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.110> I'm<00:03:10.200> just

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
going to do is quite simple so I'm just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.460 
going to do is quite simple so I'm just
going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> hold<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.850> butane<00:03:12.210> torch<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
going to hold the butane torch on the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.610 
going to hold the butane torch on the
crucible<00:03:15.500> aim<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.770> gold<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.310> this

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
crucible aim it at the gold like this

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.610 
crucible aim it at the gold like this
and<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.800> just<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.490> heat<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.000> gold<00:03:21.210> up

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and it's just going to heat the gold up

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.460 
and it's just going to heat the gold up
you<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.830> want<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.690> hold<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.930> butane<00:03:25.230> torch

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
you don't want to hold the butane torch

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.740 
you don't want to hold the butane torch
so<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.890> upside-down<00:03:26.250> or<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.270> low<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.720> low

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so it's upside-down or at a low to low

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.950 
so it's upside-down or at a low to low
angle<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.710> as<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.400> tends<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.820> go<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.810> you're

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
angle so as it tends to go out so you're

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.250 
angle so as it tends to go out so you're
just<00:03:31.020> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.620> hold<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> like<00:03:32.400> this

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
just going to have to hold it like this

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.290 
just going to have to hold it like this
okay<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.460> don't<00:03:35.490> know<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.970> but<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
okay and you don't know it but the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.180 
okay and you don't know it but the
actual<00:03:36.480> crucible<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.200> getting<00:03:37.560> very<00:03:37.740> very<00:03:37.860> hot

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
actual crucible is getting very very hot

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.130 
actual crucible is getting very very hot
now<00:03:38.490> it's<00:03:38.760> getting<00:03:39.030> up<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.630> will<00:03:39.780> get<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.020> to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
now it's getting up to it will get up to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.560 
now it's getting up to it will get up to
a<00:03:40.170> thousand<00:03:40.650> degrees<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:42.030> stage<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.480> will

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
a thousand degrees at one stage it will

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.390 
a thousand degrees at one stage it will
probably<00:03:42.720> flash<00:03:43.200> as<00:03:43.470> some<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.830> materials

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
probably flash as some of the materials

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.480 
probably flash as some of the materials
on<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.640> start<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.630> burn<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.250> will<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.460> a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
on it start to burn and that will be a

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.050 
on it start to burn and that will be a
bit<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.730> surprise<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.310> basically<00:03:50.820> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
bit of a surprise and I basically you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.640 
bit of a surprise and I basically you
have<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.270> try<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.810> drop<00:03:51.990> it<00:03:52.200> because<00:03:52.350> it's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
have to try not to drop it because it's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.710 
have to try not to drop it because it's
a<00:03:52.710> very<00:03:52.740> hot<00:03:53.220> crucible<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:54.210> drop<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.630> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
a very hot crucible you drop it on the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.130 
a very hot crucible you drop it on the
desk

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
desk

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.380 
desk
it'll<00:03:55.740> probably<00:03:55.860> burn<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.440> I'm<00:03:58.530> just

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
it'll probably burn it so I'm just

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.170 
it'll probably burn it so I'm just
moving<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.480> torch<00:04:00.750> around<00:04:01.910> trying<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.090> as

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
moving the torch around trying to get as

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.750 
moving the torch around trying to get as
much<00:04:03.330> heat<00:04:03.600> as<00:04:03.750> possible<00:04:04.290> onto<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.130> gold<00:04:05.370> I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
much heat as possible onto the gold I

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.210 
much heat as possible onto the gold I
can<00:04:06.480> see<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.960> gold<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.350> starting<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.950> go<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> bit

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
can see the gold is starting to go a bit

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.440 
can see the gold is starting to go a bit
of<00:04:08.400> an<00:04:08.490> orange<00:04:08.610> color<00:04:08.960> it's<00:04:09.960> around<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.320> edges

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
of an orange color it's around the edges

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.290 
of an orange color it's around the edges
it<00:04:12.450> looks<00:04:12.690> quite<00:04:12.870> shiny<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:15.000> will<00:04:15.120> start

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
it looks quite shiny and it will start

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.539 
it looks quite shiny and it will start
to<00:04:15.390> look<00:04:15.570> like<00:04:15.630> it's<00:04:15.960> wet

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
to look like it's wet

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.720 
to look like it's wet
on<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.090> surface

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.810 

and<00:04:22.210> it's<00:04:22.570> going<00:04:22.720> quite<00:04:22.900> orange<00:04:23.320> now<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.520> as<00:04:24.670> it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
and it's going quite orange now so as it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.370 
and it's going quite orange now so as it
gets<00:04:24.910> hotter<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.330> hotter<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.840> gets<00:04:25.870> up<00:04:26.170> to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
gets hotter and hotter it gets up to

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.490 
gets hotter and hotter it gets up to
different<00:04:27.250> temperatures<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:27.850> actually

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
different temperatures that actually

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.960 
different temperatures that actually
changes<00:04:29.500> color<00:04:29.560> gives<00:04:30.250> off<00:04:30.430> different<00:04:30.610> lights

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
changes color gives off different lights

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.170 
changes color gives off different lights
gives<00:04:31.360> off<00:04:31.480> orange<00:04:31.660> light<00:04:32.760> when<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.880> gets<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.150> a

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
gives off orange light when it gets to a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.720 
gives off orange light when it gets to a
high<00:04:34.390> temperature<00:04:35.160> think<00:04:36.160> it's<00:04:36.280> about<00:04:36.520> to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
high temperature think it's about to

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:47.960 
high temperature think it's about to
start<00:04:36.970> melting<00:04:37.950> looks<00:04:38.950> very<00:04:39.250> yelling

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.710 

see<00:04:48.570> it's<00:04:48.690> molten<00:04:49.200> now<00:04:49.350> wobbling<00:04:50.100> it's<00:04:51.090> moving

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
see it's molten now wobbling it's moving

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.250 
see it's molten now wobbling it's moving
you<00:04:53.110> see

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.020 

so<00:04:56.770> anyway<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.130> was<00:04:57.160> Malta<00:04:57.640> now<00:04:57.760> if<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.940> get

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
so anyway that was Malta now if you get

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.900 
so anyway that was Malta now if you get
it<00:04:58.180> molten<00:04:58.570> enough<00:05:02.430> when<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.520> gets<00:05:03.670> really

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
it molten enough when it gets really

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.840 
it molten enough when it gets really
gets<00:05:04.210> molten<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:05.620> can<00:05:05.830> pour<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.100> into<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.580> mold

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
gets molten you can pour it into a mold

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.600 
gets molten you can pour it into a mold
or<00:05:07.390> something<00:05:07.750> like<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.350> can<00:05:08.530> make<00:05:08.740> some

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
or something like that you can make some

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.480 
or something like that you can make some
type<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:10.140> jewelry<00:05:11.140> with<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.350> so<00:05:11.920> that's<00:05:12.280> how

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
type of jewelry with it so that's how

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.820 
type of jewelry with it so that's how
you<00:05:12.550> melt<00:05:12.760> gold<00:05:13.080> quite<00:05:14.080> difficult<00:05:14.290> but<00:05:14.680> you've

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
you melt gold quite difficult but you've

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.800 
you melt gold quite difficult but you've
got<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.220> have<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.060> lot<00:05:16.240> of<00:05:16.270> safety<00:05:16.540> equipment

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
got to have a lot of safety equipment

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.760 
got to have a lot of safety equipment
that's<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.440> important<00:05:17.830> thing<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:18.280> do<00:05:18.400> it

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.830
