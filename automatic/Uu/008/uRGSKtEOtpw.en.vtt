detectable<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.289> that<00:02:07.950> Doppler<00:02:08.399> effect<00:02:08.700> was

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
detectable not that Doppler effect was

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.390 
detectable not that Doppler effect was
made<00:02:09.060> over<00:02:09.390> man<00:02:09.750> frequency<00:02:10.590> shift<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.220> all

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
made over man frequency shift that's all

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.420 
made over man frequency shift that's all
that<00:02:11.519> was<00:02:12.920> compression<00:02:13.920> wave<00:02:14.069> okay<00:02:14.400> a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
that was compression wave okay a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.670 
that was compression wave okay a
recorded<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.599> white<00:02:15.810> also<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.650> you
