00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.110
 welcome to a little tutorial i 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.970
 was asked how could you do that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.919
 survivor with his friends play well 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.570
 that's not hard it really is 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.179
 easy 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.400
 First and foremost, the game itself is here 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.730
 the link to the game i already have 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.189
 before being minted insert here 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 click on it and here you are yourself 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.410
 later three points underneath it unpacks it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.359
 on the desktop and the next step 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.520
 is also relatively simple 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.079
 you look for google mollschie that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.230
 followers were here for example 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.750
 real first thursday online 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 go download it and download it 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.230
 I will not do it now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 I already done everything now 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.570
 pretty much unnecessary next step 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 Here opened matschie I have it here 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.890
 It's not going to be that way with you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 look if you download it new 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 you have to press it on here and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.680
 then stands existing network 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.910
 join what will not make it 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 when your wedding 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.010
 you will network a new network 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.869
 then create a name for her 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.770
 I call it network 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.090
 for example sloppy look and the password 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 yes a few so not really necessary 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.189
 nobody will agree but now 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.040
 123 times ok sure no one will come there 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.909
 At the moment I should maybe still 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.530
 Write other digits as well the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 we do not have a new password that's yes 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.729
 make sure and you see 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.850
 tug if the ultimate password 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.290
 Here one needs the guys with her 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 you want to play your second 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.899
 they really wanted to kill 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.149
 to play the server 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.670
 no, this is how it works here 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.070
 or he goes on network or she 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.640
 goes on network look at existing 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 network join networks we 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:09.569
 but not hard at hopp and that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 word did not come alone around the field 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.490
 going 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.260
 but I will ask someone for her 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.950
 just to be afraid and he will love that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.020
 So be equally well that he has now 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.780
 done here you see smurf of love 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.200
 or storm leader yes he is in there 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 two out of five tugs and that was it 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.920
 even what we make big here 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 must be the only thing to do now 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 Here you have your name viewpoint pc 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.940
 with me a right click ipv4 clicks here 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.300
 Copy address and then sent 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.350
 those who wanted to send it to 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.180
 he wanted to play here in this 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.740
 effects is what I now do not 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.210
 but you'll do that, you know 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.970
 works so you can the dappled 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.590
 next, unpack your tip 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.530
 Rwanda you downloaded here 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.280
 that will look something like this 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.130
 she was later 3data and a real one 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.330
 Excel city you can chill out I can 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.800
 I will not do it now either 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.280
 right after the cut 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.530
 where it comes in a new medium 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 which you press here on start 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.910
 and then when your time-out was overseer 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 hello I'm mickey and show today 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.280
 I just like you on one 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.290
 Verwalter beta server dreams about 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.800
 to be able to play a fileserver 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 you look easy from fun client 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.420
 delete the old ip-address and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.160
 copy the one from the house of yours 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.450
 trust in it and press enter 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.380
 then you only wait a bit 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.780
 and then the fun can start then 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.480
 the last thing he wants to do is the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:59.930
 spam and then we are already in it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 Hello you see it yes I am the rest 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.650
 destroyed my life 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.250
 once he's all on a server side 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.050
 look for my eleven diary pages and 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.690
 Pay special attention to my little ones 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.410
