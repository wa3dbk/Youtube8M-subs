one<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.850> originally<00:00:36.570> reviewed<00:00:36.989> Buffon<00:00:37.769> in<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:38.159 
one I originally reviewed Buffon in a

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.009 
one I originally reviewed Buffon in a
FIBA<00:00:38.400> fight<00:00:38.670> against<00:00:39.089> Federico<00:00:39.600> Marchetti

FIBA fight against Federico Marchetti

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.530 
FIBA fight against Federico Marchetti
where<00:00:40.559> he<00:00:40.800> lost<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.519> I<00:00:41.610> cited<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.449> had

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
where he lost and I cited that he had

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
where he lost and I cited that he had
poor<00:00:42.839> reflexes<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.769> poor<00:00:44.010> handling<00:00:44.309> which

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
poor reflexes and poor handling which

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.460 
poor reflexes and poor handling which
destroyed<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> card<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.019> card<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
destroyed the card but this card is a

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.319 
destroyed the card but this card is a
little<00:00:46.739> bit<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.190> 92<00:00:47.610> diving<00:00:47.940> 92

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
little bit different 92 diving 92

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.439 
little bit different 92 diving 92
position<00:00:48.720> 82<00:00:49.379> reflexes<00:00:49.860> may<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.339> handling<00:00:50.879> but

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
position 82 reflexes may be handling but

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
position 82 reflexes may be handling but

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
like 10k below noise price then he is a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.910 
like 10k below noise price then he is a
good<00:04:56.480> buy<00:04:56.660> but<00:04:56.930> it's<00:04:57.290> hell<00:04:57.440> then<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.770> don't
