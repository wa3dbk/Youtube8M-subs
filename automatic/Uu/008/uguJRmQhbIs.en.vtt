00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.090
 I'm walking together 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.360
 from the pebbles to the computer 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.360
 iran 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.309
 karzai 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.759
 measurements subtractions multiplications divisions 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.360
 nowadays students spend much of their school life learning the 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.689
 calculate 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.499
 but I had few I do not understand everything 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.899
 can cogitate to credit card phone experiments with animals 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.880
 venomous 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.390
 however the result the cap was so easy 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.839
 the child's play 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.980
 stressing that he would have calculated 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 the story begins five thousand years ago 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.900
 imagine that you take care of English countryside 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.600
 his message to the nation that can count on the bad guys had as sole 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 word that calculates means success in September 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 three sheep three pebbles and so on 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.000
 In addition nature has provided us with an instrument to calculate 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 the 10 pilots 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.560
 we got the result 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 are expected at least we can keep it in our pocket 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.650
 one of the most active gestures in the world was to record from our other albums 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 As long as the sheep 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.440
 the hunters of the Paleolithic period wrote down the two cases 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.430
 do not forget the tax agreement 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 to count days as far as distances traveled 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.800
 but suddenly federal revenue that claims to tell the carts 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.880
 how much light from a very strenuous woman 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 but suppose your favorite pastime is to separate the pebbles by 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.550
 course 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 this game and give an idea of ​​the group idea 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 who has every interest that four white pebbles equals a break 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.979
 on a heel tenderness sobriety 4 but it was his pocket 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.330
 any basis for the group will give the mythical 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.730
 we still count the works according to the system my gate of curitiba from 60 to 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.180
 60 seconds we spent one minute at 60 - we spent one hour 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.689
 but perhaps because we have overcome that of life in which it is imposed on the other 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.359
 and am able ideas that work the bacchi month 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.840
 repair that happens around the central bar 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.060
 the world 2 3 4 and 5 of basketball on top but the face two three four five 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.549
 rivals below plus one up 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 2 rubber ruler of them we passed so dozens 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.620
 after all we count the points of a match our results in fukuoka anastacio 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 to calculate 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.969
 three thousand years before Christ and mosques destroyed the game we 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.599
 we use is the fan by which irritated an ugly one to 5 the shape of the hand without 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 larger as it starts today 7 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.339
 initial thousand 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.090
 to pm but these names in school because they are still in use 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.040
 but as actors kate is very complicated the game - use a date 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.829
 to count 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.579
 until around the year 700 that the Hindus of northern India have the idea of ​​a 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.669
 specific alphabet for the numbers of signs to represent everything - and only 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.579
 in numbers the Arabs brought this revolutionary therapy to the West 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.579
 in the 10th century 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.999
 with the package was represented in the monkey this month by Brazil 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.999
 finally find in its representation 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.119
 now missing the numbers admit of the francisco chesf fair 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.319
 but to calculate large are however this month and do not have any 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.779
 problem with the theme of the dome the injured still engaged in the century 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.099
 17 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.570
 athletes lime is best known for his philosophical writings 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.870
 but you knew that his father was a tax commissioner who passed the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.820
 Evening mornings doing calculations is to help you over 16 years old. 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.859
 invents first calculating machine 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.099
 the pascali 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.509
 a mechanical machine composed of a series of sprockets that allow 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.749
 change the numbers of one column in the case of accounts with the rest 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.710
 in 1837 founder of the compensation Luis 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.650
 to do the census of the American population is thus 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.949
 the first time the calculation and programming 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.869
 and entering without electricity in the calculation mechanism 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.999
 in 1945 the first computer appears based on the binary system 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.109
 Do you know how a flashlight works? 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.819
 the current is passing or not 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.819
 the chain does not pass let's get this the dread 0 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.349
 now with a colon 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.139
 the doubts created 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.309
 in the luggage brings scenes were 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:27.300
 a person skilled in lupi 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.849
 oftentimes 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.880
 now imagine the number of possible combinations is still early 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.719
 but not when we are millions 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.960
 it is exactly this principle that is applied over the few centimeters 

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:38.920
 in an integrated circuit 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.090
 nowadays any computer in a report issued after a rebellion 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.270
 on scanned image issues 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.030
 with this the calculation power is much greater than that of those first 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.719
 accountant who weighed 30 points 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.529
 on the attack and the Deputy Attorney General
