00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750 
also going to provide a moderate level
of<00:00:46.079> drop<00:00:46.320> protection<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> drops

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of drop protection so that if it drops

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299

the<00:00:50.520> blunt<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> impact<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.960> case<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the blunt of the impact this case is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
the blunt of the impact this case is
because<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.219> raises<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
because it raises up just a bit so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020
