his big cannons and Rumble looks exactly
the<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.509> thought<00:01:21.780> he<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:23.310> we

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the way I thought he would look if we

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.670

had<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.090> vehicle<00:01:24.689> mode<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> he<00:01:25.530> has

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
had a vehicle mode and that is he has

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.670 
had a vehicle mode and that is he has
his<00:01:25.860> big<00:01:26.189> giant<00:01:26.700> Rumble<00:01:27.540> our<00:01:27.840> arms<00:01:28.170> sticking

his big giant Rumble our arms sticking
out<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> sides<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> his<00:01:29.759> car<00:01:30.090> which

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
out of the sides of his car which

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
out of the sides of his car which
probably<00:01:30.960> double<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.530> cannons<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.759> like

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

the<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.180> he<00:01:33.329> looks<00:01:33.570> especially<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.439> his<00:01:34.650> robot

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
particular stance on third-party

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.790 
particular stance on third-party
companies<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.450> I'm<00:03:45.900> pretty<00:03:46.140> neutral<00:03:46.440> on

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
companies is that I'm pretty neutral on

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.620 
companies is that I'm pretty neutral on
it<00:03:46.980> they<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:47.340> make<00:03:47.580> some<00:03:48.090> pretty<00:03:48.390> cool

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it they do make some pretty cool

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.560 
it they do make some pretty cool
accessories<00:03:49.350> but<00:03:49.739> sometimes<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.730> quality<00:03:51.269> is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
accessories but sometimes the quality is

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.750 
accessories but sometimes the quality is
just<00:03:51.959> pretty<00:03:52.230> sketchy<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.130> far<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.430> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
just pretty sketchy so far I think that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.300 
just pretty sketchy so far I think that
TFC<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.390> fans<00:03:54.810> project<00:03:55.350> are<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.800> two<00:03:56.070> best

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
TFC and fans project are the two best

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.220 
TFC and fans project are the two best
third<00:03:56.640> party<00:03:57.000> companies<00:03:57.390> out<00:03:57.570> there<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:58.200> i

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
third party companies out there but i

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.259 
third party companies out there but i
think<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.530> third-party<00:03:59.130> company<00:03:59.640> situation

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
think that third-party company situation

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.580 
think that third-party company situation
is<00:04:00.450> getting<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.870> little<00:04:01.019> bit<00:04:01.260> out<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.440> hand

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
is getting a little bit out of hand

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.140 
is getting a little bit out of hand
because<00:04:01.890> there<00:04:02.340> was<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> time<00:04:02.760> when<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.030> would

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
