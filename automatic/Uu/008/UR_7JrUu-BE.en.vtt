00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
I'm not a perfectionist to this so if

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.010 
I'm not a perfectionist to this so if
you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.850> work<00:03:13.150> out<00:03:13.330> what<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:13.660> you'll<00:03:13.870> know

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
you can work out what it is you'll know

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.870 
you can work out what it is you'll know
what<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:14.620> otherwise<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.220> supposed

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
what it is but otherwise it's supposed

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:31.610 
what it is but otherwise it's supposed
to<00:03:15.940> be<00:03:16.120> tributed<00:03:16.540> by<00:03:16.630> tenaciously

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.680 

that<00:03:32.620> was<00:03:32.740> a<00:03:32.770> text<00:03:33.130> alert<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.370> microphone<00:03:33.880> I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
that was a text alert a microphone I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.090 
that was a text alert a microphone I
should<00:03:35.110> tell<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.320> may<00:03:35.500> be<00:03:35.560> decided<00:03:35.860> but

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
should tell that may be decided but

00:03:36.100 --> 00:04:01.740 
should tell that may be decided but
there<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.280> go<00:03:59.340> I<00:04:00.340> mean<00:04:00.970> as<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.210> say<00:04:01.360> I'm<00:04:01.480> not<00:04:01.510> an

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
there we go I mean as I say I'm not an

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.960 
there we go I mean as I say I'm not an
acoustic<00:04:02.200> player<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.770> tend<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.640> favor<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
acoustic player I tend to favor the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.870 
acoustic player I tend to favor the
electrics<00:04:04.510> because<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.810> action<00:04:05.700> model<00:04:06.700> that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
electrics because the action model that

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.270 
electrics because the action model that
rips<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.180> lot<00:04:07.620> easier<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.710> deal<00:04:08.890> with<00:04:08.920> really

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
rips is a lot easier to deal with really

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.490 
rips is a lot easier to deal with really
I<00:04:09.340> mean<00:04:09.490> but<00:04:09.640> for<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.870> camera<00:04:11.170> picks<00:04:11.350> it

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
I mean but for this the camera picks it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.440 
I mean but for this the camera picks it
up<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.130> action<00:04:12.490> is<00:04:12.580> set<00:04:12.790> perfectly<00:04:13.360> I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
up it that the action is set perfectly I

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.080 
up it that the action is set perfectly I
mean<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.930> bought<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.710> from<00:04:14.950> around<00:04:15.280> Iran

so<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.570> picture<00:05:21.050> nice<00:05:21.680> western<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.250> know

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.640 

stand<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:07.090> jr.<00:06:08.090> is<00:06:08.270> quite<00:06:08.690> accurate<00:06:08.900> what<00:06:09.560> it

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
stand it jr. is quite accurate what it

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.320 
stand it jr. is quite accurate what it
doesn't<00:06:09.830> like<00:06:10.070> though<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:10.880> doesn't<00:06:11.090> like

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
doesn't like though it doesn't like

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.790 
doesn't like though it doesn't like
dropping<00:06:11.600> it<00:06:11.810> down<00:06:11.840> half<00:06:12.290> a<00:06:12.440> step<00:06:12.680> that's

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
dropping it down half a step that's

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.380 
dropping it down half a step that's
something<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:13.130> did<00:06:13.310> find<00:06:13.550> quite<00:06:13.820> irritating

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
something I did find quite irritating

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.230 
something I did find quite irritating
was<00:06:14.480> I<00:06:14.540> start<00:06:14.870> to<00:06:14.990> plug<00:06:15.170> it<00:06:15.290> into<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.620> standard

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
was I start to plug it into a standard

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.750 
was I start to plug it into a standard
tuner<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.330> get<00:06:17.540> it<00:06:17.630> down<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.870> e-flat<00:06:18.760> but

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
tuner to get it down to e-flat but

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.070 
tuner to get it down to e-flat but
otherwise<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:22.480> churning<00:06:23.480> problems<00:06:23.840> you<00:06:23.960> can

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
otherwise it churning problems you can

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.900 
otherwise it churning problems you can
go<00:06:24.170> from<00:06:24.320> E<00:06:24.500> to<00:06:24.710> D<00:06:24.740> quite<00:06:25.220> easily<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:25.640> you<00:06:25.760> could

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
go from E to D quite easily so you could

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.850 
go from E to D quite easily so you could
you<00:06:26.360> could<00:06:26.600> theoretically<00:06:26.780> put<00:06:27.410> this<00:06:27.560> track

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
you could theoretically put this track

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.030 
you could theoretically put this track
down<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.370> sort<00:06:28.550> of<00:06:28.640> you<00:06:28.760> know<00:06:29.500> D<00:06:30.500> standard

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
down to sort of you know D standard

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.970 
down to sort of you know D standard
tuning<00:06:31.430> quite<00:06:32.360> easily<00:06:32.540> or<00:06:32.840> you<00:06:32.870> you<00:06:33.230> whatever

tuning quite easily or you you whatever

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.650 
tuning quite easily or you you whatever
the<00:06:34.220> bloody<00:06:34.430> thing<00:06:34.640> got<00:06:34.880> daddy's<00:06:35.330> or<00:06:35.420> whatever
