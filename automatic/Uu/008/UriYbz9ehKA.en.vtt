is vital to the weather of Europe and

is vital to the weather of Europe and
the<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.590> states<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.580> current<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the it states that this current is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.940 
the it states that this current is
changing<00:00:31.099> its<00:00:32.270> strength<00:00:33.500> because<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> global

there was a violent storm that swept
across<00:00:45.899> Europe<00:00:47.690> because<00:00:49.610> apparently<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
across Europe because apparently of the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
across Europe because apparently of the

drift the coming global superstorm is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.250 
drift the coming global superstorm is
about<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.260> happens<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.329> these<00:01:00.329> currents

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
about what happens as these currents

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
about what happens as these currents
that<00:01:01.440> bring<00:01:01.739> warm<00:01:02.129> water<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.210> the

that bring warm water up from the
tropics<00:01:04.110> fail<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:06.180> reason<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.720> will

tropics fail and the reason they will

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.160 
tropics fail and the reason they will
fail<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> water<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> northern

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
fail is that the water in the northern

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.460 
fail is that the water in the northern
oceans<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.220> getting<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.820> warm<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.200> heat

explanation of ice ages and the comment
he<00:02:18.890> also<00:02:19.070> made<00:02:19.490> was<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.810> was<00:02:20.960> about<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
he also made was that this was about to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.090 
he also made was that this was about to
happen<00:02:21.620> again<00:02:22.390> man<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.840> took<00:02:24.170> notes<00:02:24.740> while<00:02:24.950> he

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
happen again man I took notes while he

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.900 
happen again man I took notes while he
was<00:02:25.190> talking<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:27.050> was<00:02:27.200> complex<00:02:27.770> but<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.730> was

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
was talking and it was complex but I was

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.200 
was talking and it was complex but I was
able<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.240> sort<00:02:29.510> them<00:02:29.690> out<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:30.170> enough<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
able to sort them out well enough and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.180 
able to sort them out well enough and
when<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.240> sorted<00:02:32.720> them<00:02:32.840> out<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.290> began<00:02:33.740> to

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
when I sorted them out I began to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.170 
when I sorted them out I began to
realize<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.600> he<00:02:35.750> had<00:02:36.170> described<00:02:37.180> was

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
realize that what he had described was

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.840 
realize that what he had described was
