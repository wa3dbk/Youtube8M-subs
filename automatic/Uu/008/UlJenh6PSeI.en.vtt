00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this is the coal and this is how you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.980 
this is the coal and this is how you
make<00:01:31.250> steel<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.680> basically<00:01:35.640> exactly<00:01:36.600> like

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
make steel it's basically exactly like

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.429 
make steel it's basically exactly like
every<00:01:37.320> other<00:01:37.439> tool<00:01:38.960> however<00:01:39.960> redstone<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
every other tool however redstone is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
every other tool however redstone is
slightly<00:01:40.799> different<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.460> i'll<00:01:41.729> show<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
slightly different which i'll show you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.380 
slightly different which i'll show you
now<00:01:42.600> i<00:01:44.720> just<00:01:45.720> need<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> find<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.829> block<00:01:47.210> why<00:01:48.210> am<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
now i just need to find a block why am I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660 
now i just need to find a block why am I
always<00:01:48.420> terrible<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.020> finding<00:01:49.320> things<00:01:49.670> mmm

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
always terrible at finding things mmm

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
always terrible at finding things mmm
good<00:01:51.149> enough<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.240> also<00:01:54.420> besides<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.530> new

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
good enough so it also besides the new

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.050 
good enough so it also besides the new
oars<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> also<00:01:56.219> has<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> new<00:01:56.490> block<00:01:56.700> called<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
oars it also has a new block called the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.039 
oars it also has a new block called the
redstone<00:01:57.420> block<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:59.570> that's<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> make

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
redstone block and that's how you make

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.590 
redstone block and that's how you make
the<00:02:01.590> tools<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.750> redstone<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.490> let's<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the tools of redstone so now let's get a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.570 
the tools of redstone so now let's get a
few<00:02:06.810> sticks<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:08.340> too<00:02:08.489> lazy<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> craft<00:02:09.119> some

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.890 

so<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.060> every<00:02:13.480> other<00:02:13.510> tool

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
so it's just like every other tool

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.460 
so it's just like every other tool
except<00:02:14.860> with<00:02:15.010> blocks<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:19.470> all

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
except with blocks see it's all

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.200 
except with blocks see it's all
different<00:02:23.520> each<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.730> them<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:25.030> their<00:02:25.060> own

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
different each of them have their own

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.200 
different each of them have their own
individual<00:02:25.810> texture<00:02:26.260> some<00:02:26.680> are<00:02:27.070> very<00:02:27.790> very

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
individual texture some are very very

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.300 
individual texture some are very very
close<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.050> see<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.380> lapis<00:02:30.280> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
close like you can see the lapis and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.750 
close like you can see the lapis and
sapphire<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.010> red<00:02:33.190> stone<00:02:33.430> which<00:02:33.610> is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
sapphire and the red stone which is

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.660 
sapphire and the red stone which is
brighter<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.780> Ruby<00:02:35.050> which<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.320> darker<00:02:36.660> um

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
brighter and the Ruby which is darker um

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.090 
brighter and the Ruby which is darker um
the<00:02:39.670> obsidian<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.630> actually<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.740> do<00:02:41.860> like

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the obsidian I actually really do like

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.520 
the obsidian I actually really do like
but<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.820> think<00:02:43.150> it'd<00:02:43.240> be<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> lot<00:02:43.630> cooler<00:02:43.960> since

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
but I think it'd be a lot cooler since

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
but I think it'd be a lot cooler since
it<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:45.070> very<00:02:45.370> overpowered<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.120> has<00:02:46.270> two

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it is very overpowered and has two

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500 
it is very overpowered and has two
thousand<00:02:46.900> uses<00:02:47.050> if<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:48.370> was<00:02:48.730> made<00:02:48.970> with<00:02:49.000> blaze

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
thousand uses if it was made with blaze

different types I only had one would

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.670 
different types I only had one would
type<00:04:43.960> because<00:04:44.319> seems<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.669> we<00:04:46.300> get<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
type because seems and we get to the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.790 
type because seems and we get to the
