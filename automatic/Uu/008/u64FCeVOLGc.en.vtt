chapstick just like his mommy apparently
but<00:01:55.470> um<00:01:56.090> yeah<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.299> wanted<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.509> share<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but um yeah I just wanted to share that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.910 
but um yeah I just wanted to share that
with<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> guess<00:01:58.259> maybe<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.649> might<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
with you I guess maybe that might be

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
with you I guess maybe that might be
common<00:01:59.219> sense<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.670> most<00:01:59.820> people<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.649> it's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
common sense for most people but it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
common sense for most people but it's
the<00:02:01.710> first<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.070> I've<00:02:02.280> taken<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> do

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the first time I've taken the time to do

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.979 
the first time I've taken the time to do
it<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.750> hope<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.110> helpful<00:02:04.290> bye
