for<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> CT<00:00:13.860> scan<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:15.240> indicated<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.109> she

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
for a CT scan which indicated that she

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.910 
for a CT scan which indicated that she
had<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.740> abscess<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.580> upper<00:00:17.910> right<00:00:18.420> molar

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.170 

she<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.039> referred<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.699> couple<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
she was referred to a couple of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480 
she was referred to a couple of
endodontists<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.710> endodontist<00:00:26.340> said

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
endodontists the first endodontist said

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.560 
endodontists the first endodontist said
that<00:00:26.609> he<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.090> anything

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
that he didn't see anything

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
that he didn't see anything
the<00:00:28.109> second<00:00:28.470> endodontist<00:00:29.010> said<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> they

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the second endodontist said that they

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
the second endodontist said that they
would<00:00:29.670> recommend<00:00:30.119> taking<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> tooth<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
would recommend taking the tooth out and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.750 
would recommend taking the tooth out and
I<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> third<00:00:32.730> endodontist

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
I was the third endodontist

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.660 
I was the third endodontist
taking<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> look<00:00:35.969> at<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> patient<00:00:37.219> if<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.399> used

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
taking a look at the patient if I used

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.479 
taking a look at the patient if I used
my<00:00:38.850> imagination<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.719> might<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.410> able<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
my imagination I might be able to see a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.569 
my imagination I might be able to see a
little<00:00:41.760> radial<00:00:42.149> lucency<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> radiographs

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
little radial lucency on the radiographs

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
little radial lucency on the radiographs
but<00:00:44.579> certainly<00:00:44.969> nothing<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> could<00:00:46.079> hang

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
but certainly nothing that I could hang

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150 
but certainly nothing that I could hang
my<00:00:46.410> hat<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:49.110> took<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.410> cone<00:00:49.590> beam<00:00:49.829> scan

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
my hat on so we took a cone beam scan

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.869 
my hat on so we took a cone beam scan
looking<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> axial<00:00:51.780> plane<00:00:52.760> from<00:00:53.760> the

biting surface of the tooth up to the
tip<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> root<00:00:58.070> we<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.730> little<00:01:00.449> puff

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
tip of the root we can see a little puff

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
tip of the root we can see a little puff
of<00:01:00.870> sealer<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of sealer and then we can see a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.899 
of sealer and then we can see a
radiolucent<00:01:03.870> area

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909

from ear to ear we can see the
radiolucent<00:01:19.610> area<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.190> puff<00:01:22.460> of

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
radiolucent area and we see that puff of

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.090 
radiolucent area and we see that puff of
sealer<00:01:22.940> again<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.409> blue<00:01:24.619> arrows<00:01:24.950> are
