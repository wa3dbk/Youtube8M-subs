00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.690
 I have the right person to marisa 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:11.230
 Mendez international stylist brings us 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:13.120
 the cuts for this year and that in this 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.889
 year comes a lot of short hair so 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.530
 we can go daring like a little 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.810
 shorter we start with that good here 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.870
 we have this girl on screen and also 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.850
 I see color and good from a little bit 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.470
 keep the taste this is a cut 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 very daring because it carries out a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.850
 shaved that's very fashionable because it's a 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.800
 little manly but still gives a touch 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.110
 female is how they are is true 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 It needs a little bit too, marÃ­n returns 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 again it is spiked foot shoe 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.190
 marked as has already been discontinued 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.640
 long ago 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.340
 come back to the side again 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.399
 on the line the whole line well profiled 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.070
 and this will be stopped using good fashion 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.899
 again and with the contrast of a 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.809
 long hair in the pair the part of 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.879
 front with a nice color accent 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.399
 important is what is going to give you a 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.649
 very youthful touch to light in the case that 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.470
 be a blonde that accent is played with 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.159
 the two elements would then be made in 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.080
 any tone say violet or 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.670
 lavender or soft colors that we see as 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.220
 pastel shades in blondes ok we go with 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.600
 the following model is of how here 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.930
 we have another girl 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 she also has a short hair in 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
 this case we have a little more 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.400
 degrafted in the back we see 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.229
 that the neck is not it profiled 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.330
 inside her modern look because she 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.360
 like this part quotes and pen di 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.340
 It is soft and we have a lot of accent 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.220
 color in the front and is and 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 here if we can appreciate to always 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.600
 uses for good long for there to be a 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.299
 contrast between the short and the long 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.319
 true also here we can appreciate 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.690
 she underneath is shaved too but 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.990
 there is a rafa is a shorts short and harvard 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.060
 and the always clean line of the pin 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.880
 but below is what is called a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.760
 under cut a cut below shorter 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.230
 and above then long so 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.620
 that when the person has a lot 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.110
 hair we do a vacuum inside 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.450
 to be what that court is going to that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.970
 short cut below so that the one 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.299
 falls on it does not look so bulky a 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.299
 bulky 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.019
 Yes, exactly 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.930
 and the truth is we have orange 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.299
 we have purple we have blond then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.459
 here there are four colors so that if 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.950
 she will go to the office we can see her 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.230
 with this look 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.269
 ok but if she the night will go to the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.519
 disco and want to do something else 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.099
 daring he combs for this side and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.800
 we have much more dramatic stress of 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.720
 this side 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.959
 clear then she can play super 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.269
 functional mario personality and this 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.670
 obviously according to the age of the 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.250
 person and someone who works the person 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.160
 who can risk more to help is 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.250
 more conservative since we have this other 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.319
 blonde here like chestnut rather that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.660
 chocolate color with some strands a 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.140
 little bit more clearly that I will give 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.850
 light to the face she is a little 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.190
 with a little bit longer hair 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.150
 let's say but if we also have in the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.540
 back volume 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.430
 in this part of the volume here that 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.069
 I really like the volume in 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.799
 the back and a little more flat 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.720
 in the front part where always if 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.519
 we see in the models the accents of 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.010
 color they go in the front part has 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.260
 a lot of color come color travel and comes 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.849
 in the forward part strong because the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.769
 last year we were giving the color 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.769
 back back now for this season 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.049
 of 2013 comes the color in the part of 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.060
 forward and one and a bang also 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.799
 maritza good in this case we made a 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.260
 bangs to soften in a little 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.879
 the factions because we have my model 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.349
 she is 50 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:21.760
 there are many girls of 40 a little 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:27.040
 minus 38 are in the 30 super models 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.930
 exotic that is super daring 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.610
 and also to see that the girls 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 of curly hair can also walk to 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.370
 fashion very well if that's nice here 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.590
 we have a shaving that is like the most 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.590
 fashion at this time the most daring 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.890
 of the shaved ones shaving the isolation of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.200
 sastron because here we have and a volume 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.420
 up a flora that also has color 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.890
 because that has not been done but it does 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.500
 appreciates on the screen is a tone 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.810
 orange with lighter strands of 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.470
 orange also remains if yes 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.570
 there is color in the presence of color so that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.540
 always of movement to the hair 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.210
 it is very important that the color is 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.890
 takes a lot for this year 2013 we want 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.080
 much return to retake the color 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.540
 integrate several tones into one 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.670
 same perfect mane america a lot 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.860

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.870
