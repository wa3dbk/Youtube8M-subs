00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.069

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 still asus calm actually week 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.880
 asus kama to put you well okama 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.780
 so we look directly at the poggio at 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 helmut his party of which 485 1999 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.090
 cama so it's a little back 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.519
 money to go take and just 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 before I just bought everything for kraft 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 1 1 sleepy that's it's all frozen 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 see season we are going to be told 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 the mayor says no no no it's good 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.370
 there are more resources we are all going 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 it's good so we go 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 shoemaker cardinals that craft has us 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.719
 costed 320 miles cam pretty much it takes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.730
 the knowledge 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.110
 available 328 kamm ah good it's for the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 average scholarships rather because the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.140
 small 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 although also finally for me in fact I 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 do not really know the difference between 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.930
 small and medium then I not how much 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 take precisely your saying that's it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 small is the average price of oils 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:21.240
 and the available for kraft a belt I 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 do not know he does not seem to answer 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 because we will have to make an ellipse 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:36.509
 again to what we have before 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:37.860
 ellipses flour I think well and I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.470
 connects and ya not very long ago I 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.939
 connect me to shoot the video view 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.799
 spoon actually I spotted this asus 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.439
 you have to do a lot of 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.350
 range at his door rather gently by 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.790
 against but it does not hurt kaman 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:02:02.430
 taxes so it's pretty cool to go 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 alright so here I'm going to do a 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.469
 ellipse in agreement with the g20 a list if 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 I find you directly with 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.560
 glad everyone here find it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.640
 little one who was there that's what I was going 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.440
 that's twenty thousand 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.920
 three hundred and forty thousand if we count 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.420
 the price of the craftsman hop on kraft 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
 hope we are a little good I 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 fucking but know of course know 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.610
 really people are rudeness 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.970
 thank you good game but hey it's not even 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.170
 not too good my game is not serious 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.709
 look a little bit I think it's 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.720
 40 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.590
 so we're really not bad on three 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.540
 years over 250 years will have to check so 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.790
 this 250th year at 40-40 it's about that 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.700
 on the other hand we had the minimum gene I 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:03.989
 take on his no but too critical 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:06.510
 7.7 to 7.7 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.269
 oula oula oula oula what is 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.940
 pass today guys oh there we got 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.440
 had a thousand boxes we had almost underwear 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.989
 is perfect od well that we have a minimum 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.860
 prospecting venaille to a good I 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.680
 right from the start I think we're going to 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.849
 sell like that like we had a good 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.159
 I have no empty kraft bogie here 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.860
 ten years in sousse and yes if we do them 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.660
 even that's for sure 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.400
 suite better but we are a good gesture 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.230
 kraft you will see how much we are going 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.190
 do range to these parties up here 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.360
 to sell we will look a little bit 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.850
 light before putting it 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:53.740
 hop it's not very pretty name 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.030
 your pretty we'll put it on 681 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.260
 even with that we will be all good fish 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.090
 it is for it to advance rapidly to 102 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.610
 your goal is that it moves fast 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.470
 have to put a kaman - that's to see 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.850
 a small beautiful so I'm good it goes the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.130
 embarrassing end I think he will leave quite 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.110
 quickly I laugh cip live in the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.420
 hd video 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.900
 we offered not at all 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.940
 so we got pretty much waiting 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.370
 just a calculator because I am 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:26.830
 a little bit not very smart less 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.960
 340 miles from the shot hop that makes us 359 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.890
 1999 finally kama profits from 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.590
 benefits so it's not bad honestly 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.350
 good in what in five minutes 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.340
 if you are looking for five minutes for the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.770
 time to buy resources at all 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 so here I hope this trick 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.110
 you will have more than you will make mascara 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.210
 with feasting it's free and we get 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.010

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.490
