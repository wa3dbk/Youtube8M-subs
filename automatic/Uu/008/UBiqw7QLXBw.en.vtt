00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
to come out of this corner very strong

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.789 
to come out of this corner very strong
so<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.569> want<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.840> have<00:01:56.959> the<00:01:57.079> car<00:01:57.289> collected<00:01:57.709> up

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
real well coming into the corner so you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.089
