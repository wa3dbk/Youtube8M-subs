00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
from a previous DIY I think it makes it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.520

look<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.200> less<00:01:40.380> summary<00:01:40.770> without<00:01:41.100> the

look a lot less summary without the
level<00:01:43.530> pineapples<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> burlap<00:01:45.210> still

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
level pineapples and the burlap still

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
level pineapples and the burlap still
looks<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.530> fall<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.700> took

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
looks really fall so then I just took

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.960 
looks really fall so then I just took
some<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.750> orange<00:01:49.399> cording<00:01:50.399> ribbon

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
some of this like orange cording ribbon

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.270 
some of this like orange cording ribbon
type<00:01:51.240> material<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> draped<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> along

with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> penance<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
