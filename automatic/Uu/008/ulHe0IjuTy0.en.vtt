00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.620 
necessary and I slowed down but you
still<00:04:48.810> make<00:04:48.960> it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.090 

they<00:04:52.630> use<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.990> shortcut<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.500> which<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:54.010> how

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
they use the shortcut to which is how

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.630 
they use the shortcut to which is how
they're<00:04:54.250> going<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.460> keep<00:04:54.880> up<00:04:55.090> by<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.050> way<00:04:56.640> but

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
they're going to keep up by the way but

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.070 
they're going to keep up by the way but
class<00:04:58.270> one<00:04:58.480> you<00:04:58.540> should<00:04:58.690> really<00:04:58.810> have<00:04:58.990> an

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
class one you should really have an

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.790 
class one you should really have an
issue<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:04.180> before<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:05.020> head<00:05:05.260> here<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.590> have

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
issue so before you head here you have

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.620 
issue so before you head here you have
really<00:05:06.310> for<00:05:06.580> missions<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.970> choose<00:05:07.150> from<00:05:07.330> there

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
really for missions to choose from there

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.980 
really for missions to choose from there
is<00:05:07.840> then<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:09.040> crew<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:10.840> mission<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:12.990> bruders

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
is then a crew this mission and bruders

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.860 
is then a crew this mission and bruders
mission<00:05:14.290> that<00:05:14.350> he<00:05:14.440> gives<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:15.360> informally<00:05:16.360> go

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
mission that he gives you informally go

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.280 
mission that he gives you informally go
boy<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.800> was<00:05:17.920> close<00:05:19.020> yeah<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.080> doesn't

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
boy that was close yeah it doesn't

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.810 
boy that was close yeah it doesn't
matter<00:05:20.500> even<00:05:20.740> if<00:05:20.890> my<00:05:21.010> Zoomers<00:05:21.310> damage<00:05:21.610> at<00:05:21.700> this

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
matter even if my Zoomers damage at this

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.290 
matter even if my Zoomers damage at this
point<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.330> will<00:05:22.540> still<00:05:22.800> come<00:05:23.800> out<00:05:23.860> on<00:05:23.920> top<00:05:24.300> each

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
point I will still come out on top each

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.430 
point I will still come out on top each
race<00:05:25.540> will<00:05:25.660> have<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> different<00:05:25.930> shortcut

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
race will have a different shortcut

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.440 
race will have a different shortcut
different<00:05:26.860> track<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.850> races<00:05:28.090> will<00:05:28.180> probably
