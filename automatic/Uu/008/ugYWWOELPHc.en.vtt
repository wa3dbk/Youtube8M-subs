zone if I had to pick a favorite zone in
this<00:00:12.269> entire<00:00:12.599> game<00:00:12.900> I'd<00:00:13.259> say<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.710> is

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
this entire game I'd say this is

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.840 
this entire game I'd say this is
probably<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:16.010> love<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> music<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.760> this

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
probably it I love the music for this

probably it I love the music for this
zone<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.630> love<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:20.189> atmosphere<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.119> how<00:00:21.240> cool

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
zone I love the atmosphere and how cool

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.980 
zone I love the atmosphere and how cool
it<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.380> love<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> lot<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
it is I love how you can get a lot of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.150 
it is I love how you can get a lot of
supersonic<00:00:24.990> speed<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> probably

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
supersonic speed here this is probably

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
supersonic speed here this is probably
one<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:26.750> zones<00:00:27.750> where<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
one of the first zones where you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.650 
one of the first zones where you
actually<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> feel<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.150> super<00:00:30.150> speed

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
actually get the feel that super speed

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
actually get the feel that super speed
that<00:00:30.929> sonic<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.030> really

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that sonic has and it's just really

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
that sonic has and it's just really
really<00:00:33.660> cool<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.350> only<00:00:34.559> downside<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
really cool the only downside is this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.900 
really cool the only downside is this
level<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.030> short<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.640> while<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
level is very short so while it is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.049 
level is very short so while it is
extremely<00:00:39.750> awesome<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.379> fun<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:42.000> doesn't

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
extremely awesome and fun it doesn't

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.010 
extremely awesome and fun it doesn't

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
last very long which is kind of a shame

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
last very long which is kind of a shame
in<00:00:46.020> fact<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.620> younger<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.309> kind

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
in fact when I was younger actually kind

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
in fact when I was younger actually kind
of<00:00:47.789> got<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> act<00:00:48.390> confused<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> last

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
of got this act confused with the last

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.950 
of got this act confused with the last
zone<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> game<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> whenever<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.370> here

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
zone of the game so whenever I got here

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
zone of the game so whenever I got here
and<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> child<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.539> Ocelot

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and that was a child I was like Ocelot

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.450 
and that was a child I was like Ocelot
zone<00:00:57.870> already<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.010> oh<00:00:59.250> wait

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
zone already but then I was like oh wait

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.750 
zone already but then I was like oh wait
there's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> whole<00:01:00.030> zone<00:01:00.359> after<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> yeah

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there's a whole zone after this so yeah

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
there's a whole zone after this so yeah
it's<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.350> sure<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> wish<00:01:05.010> they

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's just very very sure I wish they

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's just very very sure I wish they
would<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.369> added<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:07.040> again

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
would have added in more to this again

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
would have added in more to this again
it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.549> cool<00:01:08.790> zone<00:01:10.729> also<00:01:11.729> gay<00:01:12.180> rings

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it's a really cool zone also gay rings

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.060 
it's a really cool zone also gay rings
although<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> worry<00:01:14.010> about

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
although we don't have to worry about

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.539 
although we don't have to worry about
rings<00:01:14.490> anymore<00:01:14.939> cuz<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:16.770> already<00:01:17.310> gotten

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
rings anymore cuz I've already gotten

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.240 
rings anymore cuz I've already gotten
all<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> Chaos<00:01:18.420> Emeralds

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.820 

yeah<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.549> you'll<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.150> second<00:01:27.830> the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
yeah as you'll see in a second the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.580 
yeah as you'll see in a second the
active<00:01:29.190> owners<00:01:29.430> already<00:01:29.640> completed<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:34.440> N

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
active owners already completed the N

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.850 
active owners already completed the N
I'm<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.040> long<00:01:35.280> zone

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.410 

so<00:01:39.860> probably<00:01:40.250> end<00:01:40.400> up<00:01:40.430> being<00:01:40.610> shorter<00:01:41.210> than

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
so probably end up being shorter than

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.050 
so probably end up being shorter than
the<00:01:42.730> green<00:01:43.730> hill<00:01:44.000> zone<00:01:44.030> videos<00:01:48.910> let's<00:01:49.910> try

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
the green hill zone videos let's try

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.760 
the green hill zone videos let's try
that<00:01:50.150> again<00:01:50.210> oh<00:01:54.100> wow<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.690> was<00:01:56.720> some<00:01:57.380> good<00:01:57.560> air

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.230 
already is in space this is the star
light<00:02:05.180> zone<00:02:05.210> after<00:02:05.690> all<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:06.730> still<00:02:07.730> even<00:02:08.000> more

fact<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.200> guess<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.709> was<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.860> kid<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.580> actually

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
fact I guess when I was a kid I actually

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.920 
fact I guess when I was a kid I actually
had<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> Sonic<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> Hedgehog<00:02:54.420> jigsaw<00:02:55.420> puzzle

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
had a Sonic the Hedgehog jigsaw puzzle

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.590 
had a Sonic the Hedgehog jigsaw puzzle
and<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.459> featured<00:02:58.150> those<00:02:58.360> little

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
and it actually featured those little

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.180 
and it actually featured those little
seesaw<00:02:59.170> enemies

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
seesaw enemies

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.660 
seesaw enemies
I<00:03:01.049> think<00:03:02.049> dr.<00:03:02.380> Robotnik<00:03:02.890> was<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> picture

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
I think dr. Robotnik was on the picture

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.340 
I think dr. Robotnik was on the picture
too<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.360> might<00:03:04.540> actually<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:05.140> something

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
too so it might actually have something

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.610 
too so it might actually have something
to<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> boss<00:03:05.950> fights<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.850> world<00:03:07.150> but

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
to it the boss fights of this world but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
yeah when I was younger I had a jigsaw

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.449 
yeah when I was younger I had a jigsaw

that<00:04:34.570> modern<00:04:35.440> sonic<00:04:35.740> games<00:04:36.130> couldn't

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
that modern sonic games couldn't

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.600 
that modern sonic games couldn't
replicate<00:04:36.880> this<00:04:37.770> speed<00:04:38.770> aspect<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
replicate this speed aspect of the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.480 
replicate this speed aspect of the
series<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.240> mean<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:41.260> generations<00:04:42.070> did<00:04:42.400> a

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
series I mean I think generations did a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.570 
series I mean I think generations did a
good<00:04:42.790> job<00:04:42.850> of<00:04:43.390> making<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.900> very<00:04:44.620> nice<00:04:45.010> solid

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
good job of making a very nice solid

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.540 
good job of making a very nice solid
attempt<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:47.440> know<00:04:47.560> basically<00:04:48.040> making<00:04:48.340> a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
attempt that you know basically making a

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.670 
attempt that you know basically making a
super<00:04:49.090> high-speed<00:04:49.300> Sonic<00:04:50.170> game<00:04:50.380> that's

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
super high-speed Sonic game that's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.940 
super high-speed Sonic game that's
modernized<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.240> don't<00:04:53.170> know<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.350> still<00:04:53.710> feel

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
modernized but I don't know I still feel

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.720 
modernized but I don't know I still feel
like<00:04:53.980> well<00:04:54.640> compared<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.890> Genesis<00:04:57.430> games

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
like well compared to the Genesis games

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.940 
like well compared to the Genesis games
and<00:04:58.060> whatnot<00:04:58.270> they<00:04:58.930> never<00:04:59.140> really<00:04:59.470> got<00:04:59.770> it

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
and whatnot they never really got it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.850 
and whatnot they never really got it
completely<00:05:00.640> right<00:05:01.380> there<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.620> lot<00:05:02.830> of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
completely right there are a lot of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.180 
completely right there are a lot of
examples<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.640> came<00:05:03.970> close<00:05:04.270> though

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
examples that came close though

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.300 
examples that came close though
anyway<00:05:06.190> boss<00:05:06.490> time<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:10.630> yes<00:05:11.440> we<00:05:11.740> have<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.040> use

anyway boss time and yes we have to use

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.810 
anyway boss time and yes we have to use
these

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.080 

seesaws<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:17.390> hurt<00:05:17.660> Robotnik<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.850> he<00:05:19.850> can<00:05:20.000> do

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
seesaws to hurt Robotnik and he can do

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.430 
seesaws to hurt Robotnik and he can do
this<00:05:20.270> in<00:05:20.450> one<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:20.810> two<00:05:21.080> ways

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
the bombs to launch yourself up at him

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.150 
the bombs to launch yourself up at him
you<00:05:34.910> can<00:05:35.030> actually<00:05:35.210> do<00:05:35.510> one<00:05:35.750> or<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.960> other

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:58.800 

this<00:05:40.160> can<00:05:40.370> actually<00:05:40.520> be<00:05:40.700> kind<00:05:40.970> of<00:05:41.090> difficult

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.409 

I'm<00:05:59.380> not<00:05:59.560> sure<00:05:59.740> if<00:05:59.860> one<00:06:00.130> does<00:06:00.400> more<00:06:00.639> more

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
I'm not sure if one does more more

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:16.390 
I'm not sure if one does more more
