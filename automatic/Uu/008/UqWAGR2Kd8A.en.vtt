probably learn how to do it in about a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
probably learn how to do it in about a
week<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.670> two<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.289> under<00:01:37.799> studies<00:01:38.189> from

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.279 

okay<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:49.600> one<00:01:49.899> important<00:01:50.320> thing<00:01:50.350> about<00:01:51.750> 316<00:01:52.750> is

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
okay so one important thing about 316 is

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.580 
okay so one important thing about 316 is
your<00:01:53.469> stance<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:55.390> not<00:01:55.539> as<00:01:55.990> important<00:01:56.439> I<00:01:56.500> was

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
your stance it's not as important I was

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.710 
your stance it's not as important I was
doing<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.860> tailwhip<00:01:57.310> but<00:01:57.939> I<00:01:58.270> think<00:01:58.600> it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
doing a tailwhip but I think it's

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.789 
doing a tailwhip but I think it's
important<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.289> do<00:01:59.470> whatever<00:01:59.619> you're

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730

whichever<00:02:34.510> way<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.810> more<00:02:35.019> comfortable<00:02:35.380> for

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
whichever way is more comfortable for

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.050 
whichever way is more comfortable for
you<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.610> I'll<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:39.849> just

you so I'll just do it and then just
jump<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.329> other<00:02:40.569> way<00:02:41.910> whatever<00:02:42.910> way<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.150> feels

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
jump the other way whatever way it feels

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.539 
jump the other way whatever way it feels
more<00:02:43.540> comfortable<00:02:43.890> should<00:02:44.890> be<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> way<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
more comfortable should be the way that

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.970 
more comfortable should be the way that
like<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.540> actually<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.110> 360<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
like you actually do a 360 on the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.979 
like you actually do a 360 on the
scooter<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.209> I'll<00:02:49.299> just<00:02:49.450> speed<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.870> out

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
scooter so I'll just speed that out

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.640 
scooter so I'll just speed that out
first<00:02:51.569> okay<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.750> next<00:02:52.959> thing<00:02:53.109> that<00:02:53.260> you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
first okay the next thing that you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.180 
first okay the next thing that you
should<00:02:53.680> set<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.069> for<00:02:54.430> when<00:02:54.910> doing<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.329> 360<00:02:55.720> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
should set up for when doing a 360 is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.650 
should set up for when doing a 360 is
right<00:02:57.190> after<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.700> know<00:02:58.000> which<00:02:58.209> way<00:02:58.420> you're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
right after you know which way you're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.740 
right after you know which way you're
going<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.870> do<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> whole<00:02:59.650> 360<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.390> when<00:03:01.630> you're

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
going to do the whole 360 so when you're

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.840 
going to do the whole 360 so when you're
on<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> screen<00:03:02.170> about<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.650> do<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.519> really

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
on the screen about to do it you really

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.900 
on the screen about to do it you really
have<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.030> get<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.269> bend<00:03:04.510> your<00:03:04.630> knees<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.910> have

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
have to get to bend your knees you have

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.759 
have to get to bend your knees you have
to<00:03:07.060> bend<00:03:07.269> your<00:03:07.420> knees<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.019> twist<00:03:08.530> your

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
to bend your knees and twist your

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.759 
to bend your knees and twist your
shoulder<00:03:09.250> your<00:03:10.150> whole<00:03:10.389> upper<00:03:10.780> body<00:03:11.049> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
shoulder your whole upper body the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.470 
shoulder your whole upper body the
opposite<00:03:12.340> way<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.519> you're<00:03:12.910> going<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.090> spin

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
opposite way that you're going to spin

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.030 
opposite way that you're going to spin
so<00:03:14.079> it's<00:03:14.230> kind<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> little<00:03:14.739> momentum

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so it's kind of like a little momentum

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.250 
so it's kind of like a little momentum
thing<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> spin<00:03:16.389> this<00:03:16.690> way

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
thing so I spin this way

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
thing so I spin this way
so<00:03:17.829> you'll<00:03:18.069> see<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.370> back<00:03:18.579> when<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.910> 360<00:03:19.540> but<00:03:20.440> um

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
so you'll see my back when I 360 but um

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.550 
so you'll see my back when I 360 but um
like<00:03:22.150> when<00:03:22.329> you're<00:03:22.480> winding<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:23.079> you're<00:03:23.470> gonna

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
like when you're winding up you're gonna

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.190 
like when you're winding up you're gonna
see<00:03:23.739> my<00:03:23.889> chest<00:03:24.280> more<00:03:24.549> so<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.450> when<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.600> do<00:03:25.720> jump

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
see my chest more so that when I do jump

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.520 
see my chest more so that when I do jump
I<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.889> flick<00:03:27.700> my<00:03:27.880> whole<00:03:28.060> body<00:03:28.299> around<00:03:28.530> so

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
I can flick my whole body around so

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.220 
I can flick my whole body around so
you'll<00:03:29.769> spin<00:03:30.010> faster<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.700> air<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.019> just

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
you'll spin faster in the air so I just

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.960 
you'll spin faster in the air so I just
do<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> couple<00:03:32.769> times<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.670> don't<00:03:33.819> really

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
do that a couple times you don't really

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.090 
do that a couple times you don't really
have<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> jump<00:03:34.569> but<00:03:34.810> just<00:03:34.989> practice<00:03:35.500> winding

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
have to jump but just practice winding

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.860 
have to jump but just practice winding
up<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.400> bending<00:03:36.639> your<00:03:36.670> knees<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:36.910> getting

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
up and bending your knees and getting

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.990 
up and bending your knees and getting
comfortable<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.370> last<00:03:42.579> thing<00:03:42.760> you're<00:03:42.910> gonna

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
comfortable the last thing you're gonna

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.050 
comfortable the last thing you're gonna
need<00:03:43.239> for<00:03:43.299> doing<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.959> good<00:03:44.230> 360<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.519> good

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
need for doing a good 360 is a good

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.539 
need for doing a good 360 is a good
bunnyhop<00:03:46.569> now<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.560> important<00:03:48.069> thing<00:03:48.099> here<00:03:48.519> is

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
bunnyhop now the important thing here is

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.059 
bunnyhop now the important thing here is
unlike<00:03:48.880> at<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.299> lip<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:50.500> don't<00:03:50.680> need<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.950> get

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
unlike at a lip you don't need to get

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.740 
unlike at a lip you don't need to get
high<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.489> order<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.880> do<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:52.450> have<00:03:52.660> to

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
high in order to do it you just have to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.990 
high in order to do it you just have to
be<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.019> complete<00:03:53.470> control<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.280> have<00:03:54.459> balance

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
be in complete control and have balance

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.150 
be in complete control and have balance
cause<00:03:55.780> if<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.019> go<00:03:56.139> up<00:03:56.260> for<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> 360<00:03:56.949> and<00:03:56.979> you're

cause if you go up for a 360 and you're

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.219 
cause if you go up for a 360 and you're
jumping<00:03:57.400> like<00:03:57.639> as<00:03:57.790> high<00:03:58.030> as<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.299> can<00:03:58.329> you're

jumping like as high as you can you're
not<00:03:59.259> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> keep<00:03:59.739> your<00:03:59.919> balance<00:04:00.100> enough<00:04:00.519> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
not going to keep your balance enough to

you'll<00:04:04.230> just<00:04:04.319> have<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:04.560> step<00:04:04.829> off<00:04:05.360> so<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.390> get

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
you'll just have to step off so just get

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.069 
you'll just have to step off so just get
a<00:04:07.260> nice<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.860> good<00:04:08.189> bunnyhop<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.939> just<00:04:09.840> find

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
another tip that I just found we're

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.090 
another tip that I just found we're
trying<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> do<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> 360<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.620> keep<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.860> deck

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
trying to do a 360 is to keep the deck

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.430 
trying to do a 360 is to keep the deck
completely<00:04:26.280> flat<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.570> when<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.810> blending<00:04:28.289> up

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
completely flat and when you blending up

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.010 
completely flat and when you blending up
don't<00:04:28.979> lean<00:04:29.220> back<00:04:29.520> then<00:04:30.270> you'll<00:04:30.419> be<00:04:30.539> spinning

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
don't lean back then you'll be spinning

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.379 
don't lean back then you'll be spinning
like<00:04:31.199> that<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.250> you'll<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.610> go<00:04:33.030> up<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.270> your

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
like that and you'll like go up on your

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.529 
like that and you'll like go up on your
back<00:04:33.539> wheel<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.990> you'll<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:35.300> don't<00:04:36.300> lean

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
back wheel and you'll and and don't lean

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:37.909 
back wheel and you'll and and don't lean
forward<00:04:36.930> when<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.139> jump<00:04:37.410> because<00:04:37.680> they'll

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
forward when you jump because they'll

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.260 
forward when you jump because they'll
just<00:04:38.010> turn<00:04:38.280> out<00:04:38.400> pretty<00:04:38.610> bad<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.030> you'll<00:04:39.150> have

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
just turn out pretty bad and you'll have

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.510 
just turn out pretty bad and you'll have
to<00:04:39.360> step<00:04:39.570> off<00:04:39.810> yet<00:04:40.050> again<00:04:40.169> so<00:04:41.070> when<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.280> jump

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
to step off yet again so when you jump

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.150 
to step off yet again so when you jump
jump<00:04:41.910> straight<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.300> but<00:04:43.229> then<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.770> twist

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
jump straight up but then you just twist

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.640 
jump straight up but then you just twist
at<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.490> same<00:04:44.760> time<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.110> after<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.530> like

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
at the same time so after you like

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.890 
at the same time so after you like
you've<00:04:46.800> taken<00:04:46.949> into<00:04:47.760> consideration<00:04:47.910> all

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
you've taken into consideration all

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.159 
you've taken into consideration all
those<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.560> basic<00:04:50.010> things<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.370> your<00:04:50.520> 360<00:04:51.169> go

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
those like basic things for your 360 go

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.029 
those like basic things for your 360 go
out<00:04:52.349> and<00:04:52.560> try<00:04:52.770> it

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
out and try it

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.480 
out and try it
ride<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.940> little<00:04:54.270> slow<00:04:54.599> and<00:04:55.220> I'll<00:04:56.220> show<00:04:56.460> you

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
ride a little slow and I'll show you

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.790 
ride a little slow and I'll show you
something<00:04:56.820> now<00:04:56.970> from<00:04:57.330> each<00:04:57.690> angle<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.500> you

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
something now from each angle so you

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:09.480 
something now from each angle so you
just<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.430> gist<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.849> it

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.279 

now<00:05:10.490> I'm<00:05:10.639> just<00:05:10.759> showing<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.360> from<00:05:11.630> each

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
now I'm just showing it to you from each

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.559 
now I'm just showing it to you from each
view<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.830> saw<00:05:13.039> that<00:05:13.220> was<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.460> one<00:05:13.940> side<00:05:14.240> view

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
view you saw that was the one side view

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.409 
view you saw that was the one side view
so<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:16.430> main<00:05:16.610> reason<00:05:16.639> why<00:05:16.940> I'm<00:05:17.000> doing<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.330> is

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
so the main reason why I'm doing it is

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.390 
so the main reason why I'm doing it is
so<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.930> can<00:05:18.080> pick<00:05:18.259> up<00:05:18.410> different<00:05:18.770> things<00:05:18.800> from

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
so you can pick up different things from

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.610 
so you can pick up different things from
each<00:05:19.550> view<00:05:19.819> like<00:05:20.660> from<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.960> front<00:05:21.139> which<00:05:21.470> is

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
each view like from the front which is

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.040 
each view like from the front which is
next<00:05:21.860> you'll<00:05:22.190> be<00:05:22.220> able<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.580> see<00:05:22.789> me<00:05:23.030> lined<00:05:23.780> up

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
next you'll be able to see me lined up

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.830 
next you'll be able to see me lined up
and<00:05:24.470> same<00:05:24.740> from<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.009> back<00:05:25.220> but<00:05:25.490> otherwise

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:46.100 

whatever<00:05:30.220> just<00:05:31.220> look<00:05:31.430> at<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:32.830> yeah

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.120 

hopefully<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.170> could<00:05:47.320> see<00:05:47.500> everything<00:05:47.740> from

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
hopefully you could see everything from

00:05:48.130 --> 00:06:04.420 
hopefully you could see everything from
there

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.490 

neighbors<00:06:05.430> are<00:06:05.550> watching<00:06:05.990> play<00:06:06.990> a<00:06:07.020> freak

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
neighbors are watching play a freak

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:23.480 
neighbors are watching play a freak
talking<00:06:08.400> oh<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:09.060> move<00:06:09.960> back<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.230> little<00:06:22.490> so

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
talking oh so I move back a little so

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.120 
talking oh so I move back a little so
that's<00:06:23.640> how<00:06:23.760> to<00:06:23.850> do<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.060> 360<00:06:24.650> just<00:06:25.650> put<00:06:25.980> all

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
that's how to do the 360 just put all

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.670 
that's how to do the 360 just put all
the<00:06:26.310> steps<00:06:26.520> together<00:06:27.230> start<00:06:28.230> off<00:06:28.380> with

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
the steps together start off with

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.470 
the steps together start off with
knowing<00:06:29.400> your<00:06:29.550> stance<00:06:29.790> where<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.270> like<00:06:30.390> to

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
knowing your stance where you like to

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.950 
knowing your stance where you like to
put<00:06:30.630> your<00:06:30.750> feet<00:06:30.930> on<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.050> scooter<00:06:32.960> knowing

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
put your feet on the scooter knowing

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.720 
put your feet on the scooter knowing
which<00:06:34.080> way<00:06:34.260> you<00:06:34.320> jump<00:06:34.770> in<00:06:34.950> the<00:06:35.070> air<00:06:35.100> like

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
which way you jump in the air like

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.659 
which way you jump in the air like
people<00:06:36.120> can<00:06:36.240> do<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.450> both<00:06:36.600> ways<00:06:36.950> but<00:06:37.950> it's

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
people can do it both ways but it's

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.310 
people can do it both ways but it's
better<00:06:38.820> just<00:06:38.970> to<00:06:39.150> learn<00:06:39.300> one<00:06:39.540> way<00:06:39.690> first<00:06:40.050> and

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
better just to learn one way first and

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.550 
better just to learn one way first and
then<00:06:40.410> move<00:06:40.560> to<00:06:40.710> the<00:06:40.830> other<00:06:41.930> wind<00:06:42.930> up<00:06:43.200> and<00:06:43.380> bend

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
then move to the other wind up and bend

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.140 
then move to the other wind up and bend
your<00:06:43.620> knees<00:06:44.419> get<00:06:45.419> a<00:06:45.450> good<00:06:45.690> bunnyhop<00:06:46.169> and<00:06:47.150> make

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
your knees get a good bunnyhop and make

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.909 
your knees get a good bunnyhop and make
sure<00:06:48.330> you're<00:06:48.480> going<00:06:48.660> at<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.900> decent<00:06:49.080> speed<00:06:49.260> not

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
sure you're going at a decent speed not

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.790 
sure you're going at a decent speed not
too<00:06:50.220> fast<00:06:50.520> like<00:06:50.730> speed<00:06:51.030> demon<00:06:51.390> and<00:06:51.750> not<00:06:52.620> too

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
too fast like speed demon and not too

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.120 
too fast like speed demon and not too
slow<00:06:52.980> so<00:06:53.520> you're<00:06:53.640> like<00:06:53.760> not<00:06:53.940> moving<00:06:54.330> at<00:06:54.419> all<00:06:55.130> so

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
slow so you're like not moving at all so

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.450 
slow so you're like not moving at all so

you<00:07:17.970> can't<00:07:18.240> get<00:07:18.390> a<00:07:18.450> 360<00:07:19.080> and<00:07:19.290> the<00:07:19.890> main<00:07:20.070> reason

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
you can't get a 360 and the main reason

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.370 
you can't get a 360 and the main reason
is<00:07:20.700> that<00:07:20.760> you<00:07:21.210> can't<00:07:21.479> get<00:07:21.570> the<00:07:21.690> full<00:07:21.810> rotation

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
is that you can't get the full rotation

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.990 
is that you can't get the full rotation
and<00:07:22.560> you're<00:07:22.680> landing<00:07:22.890> like<00:07:23.100> sideways<00:07:23.700> and

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
and you're landing like sideways and

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.870 
and you're landing like sideways and
like<00:07:24.810> you<00:07:24.990> can't<00:07:25.260> roll<00:07:25.500> away<00:07:25.620> so<00:07:26.610> other<00:07:26.790> than

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
like you can't roll away so other than

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.760 
like you can't roll away so other than
that<00:07:27.060> you<00:07:27.690> can't<00:07:27.930> really<00:07:28.140> mess<00:07:28.320> up<00:07:28.440> too<00:07:28.620> much

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
that you can't really mess up too much

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.409 
that you can't really mess up too much
and<00:07:29.010> you<00:07:29.070> can<00:07:29.190> see<00:07:29.310> how<00:07:29.430> I<00:07:29.460> picked<00:07:29.910> my<00:07:30.060> foot<00:07:30.270> up

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
and you can see how I picked my foot up

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.440 
and you can see how I picked my foot up
but<00:07:31.280> yeah<00:07:32.280> that's<00:07:32.490> really<00:07:32.880> all<00:07:33.090> you<00:07:33.210> can<00:07:33.270> do

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450 
but yeah that's really all you can do

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:41.990 
but yeah that's really all you can do
wrong

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.060 

you
