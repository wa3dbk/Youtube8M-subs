you<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.080> she<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.500> should<00:02:29.830> hold<00:02:30.930> no<00:02:31.930> will

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
you just she just should hold no will

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.940 
you just she just should hold no will
turn<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:34.110> give<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.290> um<00:02:36.390> 10<00:02:37.390> seconds<00:02:37.810> let's<00:02:38.080> see

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.800 

maybe<00:02:41.950> Maya<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.610> probably<00:02:42.940> dead<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.720> I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
maybe Maya it's probably dead because I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.180 
maybe Maya it's probably dead because I
haven't<00:02:43.959> charged<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> while<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:44.830> all<00:02:45.040> you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
haven't charged in a while but all you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.340 
haven't charged in a while but all you
do<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.400> hold<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.820> tell<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> how<00:02:46.180> much<00:02:46.360> power

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
do is hold and tell you how much power

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.320 
do is hold and tell you how much power
you<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.650> left<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.820> at<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.240> bottom

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
you have left and then at the bottom

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.670 
you have left and then at the bottom
here<00:02:49.600> there's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> little<00:02:49.990> silicon<00:02:50.320> tab<00:02:50.500> that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
here there's a little silicon tab that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.000 
here there's a little silicon tab that
blocks<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.250> mini<00:02:51.820> USB<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.360> charge<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.780> sync<00:02:53.050> so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
blocks the mini USB to charge in sync so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.050 
blocks the mini USB to charge in sync so
you<00:02:54.100> don't<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.430> remove<00:02:54.610> your<00:02:54.760> iPhone

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
you don't have to remove your iPhone

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.270 
you don't have to remove your iPhone
from<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.330> case<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.380> overall<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.190> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
from the case so overall it's a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.880 
from the case so overall it's a
definitely<00:02:57.640> nice<00:02:57.850> battery<00:02:58.300> pack<00:02:58.510> um<00:02:58.890> for

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
definitely nice battery pack um for

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.620 
definitely nice battery pack um for
first<00:03:00.100> looks<00:03:00.310> there's<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.940> couple<00:03:01.090> issues<00:03:01.330> with

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
first looks there's a couple issues with

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.850 
first looks there's a couple issues with
it<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.959> that's<00:03:02.110> why<00:03:02.260> they're<00:03:02.380> releasing<00:03:02.650> a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
it and that's why they're releasing a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.540 
it and that's why they're releasing a
version<00:03:03.340> 2<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:03.970> model<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:05.370> issues<00:03:06.370> where

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
version 2 of this model the issues where

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.220 
version 2 of this model the issues where
I<00:03:06.580> believe<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.870> kept<00:03:09.690> disconnecting<00:03:10.690> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
I believe it kept disconnecting and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860 
I believe it kept disconnecting and
reconnecting<00:03:11.290> itself<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.340> lot<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.600> I'll<00:03:13.750> have

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
reconnecting itself a lot and I'll have

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.000 
reconnecting itself a lot and I'll have
a<00:03:13.930> damaged<00:03:14.200> I'll<00:03:14.530> show<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.739> guys<00:03:14.860> thought

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
a damaged I'll show you guys thought

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.979 
a damaged I'll show you guys thought

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
that looks like in a minute when i get

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.100 
that looks like in a minute when i get
this<00:03:17.140> charged<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:19.090> that's<00:03:19.269> basically<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.780> uh
