year and a half ago and think bill built
the<00:00:15.509> pool<00:00:15.719> initially<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.619> they've<00:00:16.949> tried<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the pool initially and they've tried to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
the pool initially and they've tried to
find<00:00:17.520> someone<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> create<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> natural

they got the one wish they got the
negative<00:00:23.730> edge<00:00:24.090> pool<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.590> thing<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
negative edge pool the only thing is the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.429 
negative edge pool the only thing is the
designer<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> initial<00:00:27.900> pool<00:00:28.109> didn't

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
designer of the initial pool didn't

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.070 
designer of the initial pool didn't
think<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.769> matching<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.789> color<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
think about matching the color of the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.500 
think about matching the color of the
pool<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.279> water<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.700> appears<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> be

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
pool with the water that appears to be

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.350 
pool with the water that appears to be
flowing<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.890> part<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> redesign<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
flowing into so part of the redesign of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
flowing into so part of the redesign of
this<00:00:36.510> negative<00:00:36.840> edge<00:00:36.960> pool<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> dark

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
this negative edge pool was to do a dark

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790 
this negative edge pool was to do a dark
crystal<00:00:38.910> stone<00:00:39.120> interior<00:00:39.600> finish<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
crystal stone interior finish so that it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.389 
crystal stone interior finish so that it
matches<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> dark<00:00:41.460> water<00:00:41.760> behind<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.450> also

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
matches the dark water behind it also

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
matches the dark water behind it also
basically<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:44.969> were<00:00:45.030> looking<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.510> with

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
basically all they were looking at with

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.799 
basically all they were looking at with
some<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.469> concrete<00:00:46.860> columns<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.360> small

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
some some concrete columns and a small

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
some some concrete columns and a small
negative<00:00:49.050> edge<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> bay<00:00:50.489> behind<00:00:50.940> them

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
negative edge into the bay behind them

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
negative edge into the bay behind them
and<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.050> didn't<00:00:52.320> give<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.530> any<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and it didn't give them any kind of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
and it didn't give them any kind of
atmosphere<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.449> we've<00:00:54.600> done<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> we've

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
atmosphere what we've done here is we've

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.670 
atmosphere what we've done here is we've
we've<00:00:56.219> framed<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.090> view<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.230> beautiful

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
we've framed the view with two beautiful

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.160 
we've framed the view with two beautiful
waterfalls<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.180> negative<00:01:00.629> edge<00:01:00.750> where<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
waterfalls and a negative edge where the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
waterfalls and a negative edge where the
water<00:01:01.410> matches<00:01:01.980> perfectly<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.789> water<00:01:03.030> color

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
water matches perfectly the water color

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
water matches perfectly the water color
of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.989> base<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.489> appears<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.240> it's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of the base so now it appears that it's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.310 
of the base so now it appears that it's
all<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.439> big<00:01:08.250> body<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> water<00:01:09.049> praying<00:01:10.049> by

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
all of one big body of water praying by

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
all of one big body of water praying by
two<00:01:10.380> beautiful<00:01:10.830> mountain<00:01:11.520> streams<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> come

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
two beautiful mountain streams that come

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.929 
two beautiful mountain streams that come
down<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> water<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
down into the water and this was just a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.460 
down into the water and this was just a
really<00:01:15.119> exciting<00:01:15.540> job<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
really exciting job to see the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.429 
really exciting job to see the
transformation<00:01:16.950> happening<00:01:17.960> another<00:01:18.960> thing

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
transformation happening another thing

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.399 
transformation happening another thing
that<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.360> affected<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> view<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that really affected the view of the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.859 
that really affected the view of the
effect<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> negative<00:01:23.189> edge<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.360> had

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
effect of the negative edge was they had

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
effect of the negative edge was they had
it<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.140> cut<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> screen<00:01:27.119> cage

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it all cut up with with the screen cage

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.520 
it all cut up with with the screen cage
and<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.390> raised<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.810> one

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and what we did was we raised the one

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
and what we did was we raised the one
bar<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.070> has<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:33.390> above<00:01:33.630> your

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bar that has to be there up above your

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.920 
bar that has to be there up above your
views<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
views so you don't see it and the the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
views so you don't see it and the the
horizontal<00:01:37.590> bar<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> vertical<00:01:38.670> we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
horizontal bar and then the vertical we

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.200 
horizontal bar and then the vertical we
kept<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.490> whereas<00:01:41.820> before

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
kept from there up that whereas before

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
kept from there up that whereas before
it<00:01:42.390> came<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> way<00:01:43.049> down<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> split<00:01:43.860> your

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it came all the way down and split your

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
it came all the way down and split your
view<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.430> half<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.090> before<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
view in half so it before it really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
view in half so it before it really
didn't<00:01:45.990> look<00:01:46.079> natural<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.040> what

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
didn't look natural at all because what

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.670 
didn't look natural at all because what
kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> body<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> water<00:01:48.570> has<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> piece<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
kind of body of water has a piece of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
kind of body of water has a piece of
aluminum<00:01:50.399> sticking<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.210> through<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
aluminum sticking right up through it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.539 
aluminum sticking right up through it
right<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.070> perfect

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
right so now you got this perfect

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.569 
right so now you got this perfect
picture<00:01:53.729> frame<00:01:54.710> right<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.310> framing

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
picture frame right here just framing
