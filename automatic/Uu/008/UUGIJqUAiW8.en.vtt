00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.150
 know now what to watch in the sky this 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.400
 week with the naked eye 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.830
 early in the evening we can observe the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.020
 planet jupiter in the north direction 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.690
 in the constellation of twins it stays 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.880
 visible until 11 p.m. 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.920
 and this is the best week of the year for 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.990
 to observe the planet Mars 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.780
 on the night of April 8 the planet 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.059
 red to achieve their opposition when 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.730
 brightest visible during 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.920
 all night to find him 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.409
 by a bright reddish star in the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
 constellation of virgin very close to 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.670
 star explains 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.219
 can be observed from the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.800
 20 hours in the constellation of pound 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.499
 venus the brightest of the planets 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.979
 appears at 3 o'clock east on the 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:00.799
 Aquarium constellation 5:06 when 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:04.960
 day was already clearing mercury is born 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.960
 east in the constellation of fish 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.270
 the works the last weeks talking 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.940
 on the conquest of the moon a landmark in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 history of human space exploration 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.410
 the North American landings to the moon were 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 accompanied by billions of people in 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.440
 all the world 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 but curiously they did not convince some 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.300
 who believe until now that everything does not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.180
 passed from a staging of the states 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.350
 united to defeat the Soviet Union in 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 space race 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.960
 the so-called lunar conspiracy theories 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.479
 have existed since the 1970s 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 motivated by the end of the apollo program 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.540
 and popularized by a writer of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 technical manuals called the case your 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 accusations soon gained the support of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.130
 obscure flat earth society 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.640
 according to them the landing of neil armstrong 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 was filmed in Hollywood with sponsorship 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.700
 to disdain in directed by stanley 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.470
 kubrick 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.380
 these statements were made in a 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.209
 period in which the American society 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 was shaken by the scandal of 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.330
 watergate and had failed in the war 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.280
 various sectors of society 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.830
 became distrustful of the government 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.660
 contributed to the dissemination of these 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
 conspiracy theories 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 the case arguments and several others 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.550
 authors are all very fragile and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.480
 easily results using 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.090
 knowledge of science in teaching 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.090
 medium or just common sense 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 the most popular are based on photos 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 taken on the lunar surface 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.290
 the absence of stars in the images would be 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.810
 evidence that they had been made 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.890
 in the studio, it's easy to understand why 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.780
 happens 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.110
 you can only register stars in 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.300
 photographs using long exposures the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 which was not the case with the images made in 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.060
 because the environment was precisely 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.830
 well of course do yourself test 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.530
 try taking a picture of a night 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.170
 using flash will be possible 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.540
 to register what is near the camera but 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.820
 the stars will not appear again 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 supposed controversy would be that the flag 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.620
 American was fluttering what is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.840
 impossible in the lunar environment where there 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.450
 exists the weapon in an event in fact the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.250
 flags were intentionally 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.710
 kneaded to give just this 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.260
 company 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.450
 in the photos if we watch the movies where 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.880
 the flags appear it is possible 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.210
 check that they are still 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.730
 all the time as expected in between 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.680
 there is no shadow of doubt 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.200
 that the landings were real 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.760
 the Soviet scientists themselves 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.550
 recognize the fact and would be the first 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.000
 to report an alleged fraud so 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.860
 so blatant so pay no attention to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.780
 these conspiracy theories 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 unless you want to have fun 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.020
 until the next program and its 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.020
 books to all 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.650
 is
