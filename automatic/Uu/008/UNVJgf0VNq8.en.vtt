00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.620
 almost always the Colombian teams that 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.860
 have reached final instances have been 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.879
 characterized by having a good game 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.220
 defensively they are not teams that 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.790
 excel for having a great virtue in 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.279
 that facet of his game I think that in 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.290
 we see this sense even of what 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.300
 try to show the coach a 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.520
 coach who plays with a line of 3 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.880
 well marked four players in the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.770
 half field easily 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.400
 they regroup to handcuff him to a line of 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.620
 5 a well-defined hitch 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.720
 and two front-ends well after 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.380
 they have what the player has 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.830
 Colombian very technical very apt with the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.900
 ball always prioritizing in his game 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.390
 trying to give a good destiny to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.820
 I think that for the moment 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.250
 saw in this match with san paulo has 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 pressed well have been removed in one place 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.020
 of the court where he favored and treated 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.910
 to finish like this everything has had a 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.620
 very large fortune at least in this 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.650
 definition where it seems to me that san 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.960
 pablo- maybe he deserved a little more but 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.760
 in general terms we see that a team 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.220
 that you try to give good destiny to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.460
 ball tries to play regroups well 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.500
 when it has to be converted into its phase 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.950
 defensive where it immediately brings together a lot 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.190
 people at times we say it marks like 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.590
 we just remarked with a lot of people but 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.360
 not with quality let's say individual 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.880
 accumulates names but in such a way 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.130
 passive to which then what 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.050
 we always say try to leave risk 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.720
 a lot on the floor is always a 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.090
 good destiny 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.990
 spear 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.969
 avoiding or moving away the danger something that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.920
 it has given him many fruits at least the 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.039
 progress in the field and green 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 try to get to be able to convert it 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.110
 they have some particularities as in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.270
 its lines practically having two play 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.860
 is foreigners have only arm and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.649
 there we see it with a good save from 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.409
 archer who is Argentine after these 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.259
 Colombian players until Juan Pablo 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.289
 angel that already at a high age is there in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.540
 its lines trying to green 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.340
 I suppose finishing his career 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.650
 transitions the fast ones immediately the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.870
 flyers that are released something that well 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.980
 we said of 100 just a game that the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 Colombians often has us 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.209
 have been used for a long time 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.400
 players who are technically apt with 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.310
 very good with great technical wealth 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.049
 after some facets of game that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 surely will have to improve I think 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.730
 that is going to see a match up 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 cute open that I think that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 can go to favor river if it is 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 this river that we know or that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.030
 At least he has shown us that he can 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.920
 come back I think I do not know if 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 has great rivals at this point I 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.540
 it seems that in that sense it will depend 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.010
 a lot of what they do they do not know how much 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.260
 It will depend on what you can do 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.870
 the Colombian team in this case 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 We saw that fortune was again 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.010
 on their side they had to reach the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 penalties passed say for the penal 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.129
 but they have truly had the 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.599
 Poles in your favor shots on the poles 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.650
 some inattention that truly 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.510
 let's say it could have cost you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.180
 much for what ended up being passed 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.370
 this phase so tight for the criminal 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.200
 charge and in the repetition there is also a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.480
 dose of fortune well for being rival the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.579
 just like to go through all these 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.150
 intangibles sometimes play as we said 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.370
 3 and 10 first in Medellin then in the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 monumental river athletic national 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.440
 to know the champion of the cup 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.440
 South American
