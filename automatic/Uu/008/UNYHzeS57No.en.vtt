okay um well go eat and there's not

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
okay um well go eat and there's not
really<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> set<00:01:31.979> we've<00:01:32.640> had<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.119> really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really a set we've had really really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.720 
really a set we've had really really
sensitive<00:01:33.900> skin<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
sensitive skin I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.570 
sensitive skin I
this<00:01:34.910> would<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.090> fine<00:01:35.420> okay<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.830> not<00:01:36.980> perfume

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
this would be fine okay it's not perfume

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
this would be fine okay it's not perfume
e<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:38.390> that's<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.600> first<00:01:38.780> step<00:01:38.930> assess<00:01:39.290> one<00:01:39.410> is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
e so that's the first step assess one is

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.620 
e so that's the first step assess one is
tone<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:40.310> don't<00:01:40.460> explain<00:01:40.940> what<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.150> toner<00:01:41.420> is

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
tone you don't explain what a toner is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.450 
tone you don't explain what a toner is
because<00:01:41.960> i've<00:01:42.170> used<00:01:42.410> toner<00:01:42.680> but<00:01:42.920> our<00:01:43.010> notices

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
because i've used toner but our notices

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.450 
because i've used toner but our notices
so<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:44.240> really<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:45.020> second<00:01:45.920> step<00:01:46.160> in

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
so it's really just a second step in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.120 
so it's really just a second step in
