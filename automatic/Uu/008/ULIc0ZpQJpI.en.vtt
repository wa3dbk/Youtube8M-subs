thing<00:01:59.540> about<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.960> worst<00:02:00.230> thing<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.830> we

thing about the worst thing that we

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.690

could possibly have in this area I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.830 
could possibly have in this area I
really<00:02:04.700> think<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.030> should<00:02:05.090> be<00:02:05.420> looking<00:02:05.570> at

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
really think we should be looking at

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.760 
really think we should be looking at
alternative<00:02:06.470> energies<00:02:07.130> rather<00:02:08.030> than<00:02:08.390> these
