00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
this science panic because when I wrote

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.560 
this science panic because when I wrote
this<00:01:36.110> there<00:01:36.320> was<00:01:36.409> already<00:01:36.590> science<00:01:37.040> behind<00:01:37.310> it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
this there was already science behind it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.660 
this there was already science behind it
but<00:01:38.570> now<00:01:38.870> it's<00:01:39.320> like<00:01:39.530> yes<00:01:39.979> there's<00:01:40.280> all<00:01:40.460> this

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
but now it's like yes there's all this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.550 
but now it's like yes there's all this
more<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.270> more<00:01:41.330> every<00:01:41.810> week<00:01:41.840> I'm<00:01:42.320> like<00:01:42.470> I

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
more and more every week I'm like I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.649 
more and more every week I'm like I
can't<00:01:42.799> keep<00:01:42.979> up<00:01:43.159> with<00:01:43.400> all<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.940> science<00:01:44.450> that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
can't keep up with all the science that

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.899 
can't keep up with all the science that
is<00:01:45.080> sort<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.409> confirming<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.670> things

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
is sort of confirming all the things

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.910 
is sort of confirming all the things
that<00:01:47.150> we're<00:01:47.299> trying<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.840> understand<00:01:48.650> and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that we're trying to understand and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.070 
that we're trying to understand and
apply<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.030> gonna<00:01:50.180> blow<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.630> well<00:01:50.720> blew<00:01:50.930> my

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
apply this is gonna blow it well blew my

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.180 
apply this is gonna blow it well blew my
mind<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.470> don't<00:01:51.590> know<00:01:51.710> if<00:01:51.799> it's<00:01:51.890> gonna<00:01:52.010> blow

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
mind I don't know if it's gonna blow

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.219 
mind I don't know if it's gonna blow
your<00:01:52.310> mind<00:01:52.370> but<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> Harvard

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
your mind but so there is a Harvard

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.399 
your mind but so there is a Harvard
social<00:01:55.190> psychologist<00:01:55.760> named<00:01:55.909> Amy<00:01:56.150> Cuddy<00:01:56.409> who

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
social psychologist named Amy Cuddy who

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.130 
social psychologist named Amy Cuddy who
talks<00:01:58.220> about<00:01:58.400> how<00:01:58.790> our<00:01:59.090> bodies<00:01:59.299> change<00:01:59.960> our

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
talks about how our bodies change our

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.080 
talks about how our bodies change our
minds<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.070> our<00:02:01.250> minds<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.700> change<00:02:01.940> our

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
minds and then our minds can change our

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.840 
minds and then our minds can change our
behavior<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.650> will<00:02:03.890> affect<00:02:04.400> how

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
behavior and that it will affect how

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.780 
behavior and that it will affect how
people<00:02:04.880> perceive<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.830> also<00:02:07.070> creates

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
people perceive you but it also creates

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.929 
people perceive you but it also creates
an<00:02:08.030> internal<00:02:08.509> chemical<00:02:09.259> change<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.189> this<00:02:10.759> is

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
an internal chemical change and this is

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.610 
an internal chemical change and this is
what<00:02:11.090> we're<00:02:11.239> kind<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.140> if

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
what we're kind of going for because if

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
what we're kind of going for because if
we<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.220> what<00:02:13.730> I'm<00:02:13.849> always<00:02:14.090> teaching<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.659> we

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
we can what I'm always teaching is if we

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.350 
we can what I'm always teaching is if we
can<00:02:14.959> get<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.650> atomic<00:02:16.610> structure<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> who

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
can get to the atomic structure of who

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
can get to the atomic structure of who
we<00:02:17.510> are<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.230> internal<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:18.950> create

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
we are if we can go internal and create

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.220 
we are if we can go internal and create
the<00:02:19.519> change<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:20.030> what's<00:02:20.540> gonna<00:02:20.689> happen<00:02:21.049> out

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the change there what's gonna happen out

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.979 
the change there what's gonna happen out
here<00:02:21.489> things<00:02:22.489> are<00:02:22.610> gonna<00:02:22.730> change<00:02:22.810> things<00:02:23.810> are

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
here things are gonna change things are

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.490 
here things are gonna change things are
gonna<00:02:24.080> change

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
gonna change

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.690 
gonna change
people<00:02:24.860> are<00:02:24.950> gonna<00:02:25.040> perceive<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
people are gonna perceive you in a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.369 
people are gonna perceive you in a
different<00:02:25.879> way<00:02:26.120> jobs<00:02:26.720> are<00:02:26.870> gonna<00:02:26.989> line<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.290> in

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
different way jobs are gonna line up in

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.380

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
lots of quote-unquote miracles magical

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.729 
lots of quote-unquote miracles magical
things<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:33.169> in<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> right<00:02:33.439> place<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
things you're in the right place at the

so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.410

in her studies she's talking about

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.259 
in her studies she's talking about
behavior<00:02:41.470> physical<00:02:42.470> behavior<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.580> about

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.449 
and animal kingdom pretty much shows
including<00:02:50.900> human<00:02:51.140> beings<00:02:51.170> show<00:02:51.920> signs<00:02:52.280> of

including human beings show signs of
this<00:02:52.640> but<00:02:53.090> we're<00:02:53.269> often<00:02:53.950> sort<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.069> unconscious

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
this but we're often sort of unconscious

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.390 
this but we're often sort of unconscious
of<00:02:56.000> what<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.630> means<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.290> she<00:02:57.349> talks<00:02:58.220> about

of what it means and she talks about

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520 
of what it means and she talks about
when<00:02:58.910> we<00:02:59.180> are<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.690> she<00:02:59.930> talks<00:03:00.140> about<00:03:00.349> two

when we are in she talks about two

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.370 
when we are in she talks about two
states<00:03:00.890> there<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.910> high<00:03:02.390> power<00:03:02.690> pose<00:03:03.080> maybe

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
states there is a high power pose maybe

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.259 
states there is a high power pose maybe
you've<00:03:03.560> heard<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.830> before<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.760> low<00:03:05.000> power

two minutes the research is born it out

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.150 
two minutes the research is born it out
it<00:03:16.880> releases<00:03:17.450> those<00:03:17.900> chemicals<00:03:18.650> within<00:03:18.829> you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
high power post she talks about two

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.920 
high power post she talks about two
things<00:03:28.010> one<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.730> accelerates<00:03:29.480> your

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
things one is it accelerates your

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.750 
things one is it accelerates your
testosterone<00:03:30.410> level<00:03:31.099> so<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.489> don't<00:03:31.610> have<00:03:31.700> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
testosterone level so you don't have to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.009 
testosterone level so you don't have to
worry<00:03:31.940> about<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.239> females<00:03:32.569> it's<00:03:32.750> not<00:03:32.870> like

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
worry about it females it's not like

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.780 
worry about it females it's not like
you're<00:03:33.140> gonna<00:03:33.200> become<00:03:33.410> shemale<00:03:34.069> just<00:03:34.640> by

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you're gonna become shemale just by

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.990 
you're gonna become shemale just by
having<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.269> two-minute<00:03:35.930> power<00:03:36.440> pose<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.640> also

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
having a two-minute power pose it also

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.539 
having a two-minute power pose it also
decreases<00:03:38.390> your<00:03:39.200> cortisol<00:03:39.920> level<00:03:40.220> which<00:03:40.400> is

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
decreases your cortisol level which is

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.520 
decreases your cortisol level which is
your<00:03:40.730> stress<00:03:41.030> hormone<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:41.959> think<00:03:42.200> about<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
your stress hormone now think about this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.370 
your stress hormone now think about this
in<00:03:42.709> terms<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.220> auditioning<00:03:44.090> or<00:03:44.480> being<00:03:44.810> on<00:03:45.049> set

people<00:06:37.580> that's<00:06:38.389> exciting<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.080> know<00:06:39.110> these

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
people that's exciting to know these

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.420 
people that's exciting to know these
things<00:06:40.159> are<00:06:40.639> all<00:06:41.080> available<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.469> us<00:06:42.800> they<00:06:43.189> are

things are all available to us they are

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.079 
things are all available to us they are
what<00:06:44.330> they<00:06:44.479> require<00:06:45.050> is<00:06:45.439> just<00:06:45.949> shifting<00:06:46.789> just

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.089 
what they require is just shifting just

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.240 
what they require is just shifting just
shifting<00:06:47.599> constantly<00:06:48.229> shifting<00:06:49.129> the

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
shifting constantly shifting the

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.790 
shifting constantly shifting the
paradigms<00:06:49.789> of<00:06:50.120> who<00:06:50.599> you<00:06:50.810> think<00:06:50.839> you<00:06:51.169> are<00:06:51.199> and

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
paradigms of who you think you are and

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.610 
paradigms of who you think you are and
what<00:06:52.370> you<00:06:52.490> think<00:06:52.669> is<00:06:52.849> possible<00:06:52.909> for<00:06:53.509> you<00:06:53.629> so

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
what you think is possible for you so

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.980 
what you think is possible for you so
that's<00:06:55.550> all<00:06:55.759> I<00:06:56.000> think<00:06:56.089> well<00:06:56.449> that's<00:06:56.629> all<00:06:56.930> I

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
that's all I think well that's all I

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.240 
that's all I think well that's all I
have<00:06:57.139> to<00:06:57.259> say<00:06:57.289> today<00:06:57.620> about<00:06:59.770> just<00:07:00.770> a<00:07:00.889> different

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
have to say today about just a different

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.540 
have to say today about just a different
way<00:07:01.339> of<00:07:01.370> thinking<00:07:01.580> about

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
way of thinking about

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.090 
way of thinking about
faking<00:07:02.760> it<00:07:03.030> until<00:07:03.120> you<00:07:03.420> make<00:07:03.600> it<00:07:03.860> which<00:07:04.860> maybe

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
faking it until you make it which maybe

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.470 
faking it until you make it which maybe
I<00:07:05.220> should<00:07:05.460> just<00:07:05.640> come<00:07:05.790> back<00:07:05.910> to<00:07:06.090> that<00:07:06.240> because

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
I should just come back to that because

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.820 
I should just come back to that because
that's<00:07:06.750> one<00:07:06.960> of<00:07:07.080> her<00:07:07.200> big<00:07:07.380> things<00:07:07.620> is

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
that's one of her big things is

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.710 
that's one of her big things is
sometimes<00:07:08.310> you<00:07:08.520> guys<00:07:08.670> you're<00:07:09.150> not<00:07:09.180> gonna<00:07:09.390> feel

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
sometimes you guys you're not gonna feel

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.810 
sometimes you guys you're not gonna feel
like<00:07:09.930> that<00:07:09.990> or<00:07:10.680> maybe<00:07:10.830> you<00:07:11.010> always<00:07:11.370> feel<00:07:11.610> like

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
like that or maybe you always feel like

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.130 
like that or maybe you always feel like
that<00:07:12.030> right<00:07:12.270> I<00:07:12.420> don't<00:07:12.690> know<00:07:12.750> but<00:07:12.900> sometimes

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
that right I don't know but sometimes

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.080 
that right I don't know but sometimes
you're<00:07:13.830> not<00:07:13.860> gonna<00:07:14.280> feel<00:07:14.550> like<00:07:14.580> that<00:07:14.790> you're

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090 
you're not gonna feel like that you're

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.090 
you're not gonna feel like that you're
having<00:07:15.450> a<00:07:15.540> day<00:07:15.750> where<00:07:15.780> or<00:07:16.500> you're<00:07:16.650> having<00:07:16.980> to

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
having a day where or you're having to

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.350 
having a day where or you're having to
speak<00:07:17.340> to<00:07:17.610> a<00:07:17.640> bunch<00:07:17.850> of<00:07:17.910> people<00:07:18.030> or<00:07:18.270> you're

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
speak to a bunch of people or you're

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.910 
speak to a bunch of people or you're
having<00:07:18.480> to<00:07:18.720> go<00:07:18.840> into<00:07:19.080> an<00:07:19.170> audition<00:07:19.260> room<00:07:19.740> and

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920 
having to go into an audition room and

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.450 
having to go into an audition room and
the<00:07:20.490> the<00:07:20.790> first<00:07:21.030> response<00:07:21.510> is<00:07:21.780> like<00:07:22.410> that<00:07:22.620> her

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
the the first response is like that her

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.430 
the the first response is like that her
whole<00:07:23.730> philosophy<00:07:24.090> that<00:07:24.630> is<00:07:24.780> borne<00:07:25.080> out<00:07:25.260> in

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
whole philosophy that is borne out in

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.040 
whole philosophy that is borne out in
research<00:07:25.830> is<00:07:26.040> if<00:07:26.460> you<00:07:26.640> continue<00:07:27.240> to<00:07:27.480> fake<00:07:27.810> it

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
research is if you continue to fake it

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.930 
research is if you continue to fake it
you'll<00:07:28.410> eventually<00:07:28.710> make<00:07:29.310> it<00:07:29.490> and<00:07:29.670> you'll

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 
you'll eventually make it and you'll

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.390 
you'll eventually make it and you'll
become<00:07:30.180> it<00:07:30.630> which<00:07:31.590> is<00:07:31.770> what<00:07:31.950> I've<00:07:32.100> talked

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
become it which is what I've talked

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.340 
become it which is what I've talked
about<00:07:32.700> you<00:07:33.030> fake<00:07:33.330> it<00:07:33.510> until<00:07:33.540> you<00:07:33.810> make<00:07:33.930> it<00:07:34.110> and

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 
about you fake it until you make it and

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.720 
about you fake it until you make it and
then<00:07:34.380> you<00:07:34.470> look<00:07:34.710> back<00:07:34.890> and<00:07:35.100> you<00:07:35.190> realize<00:07:35.220> oh<00:07:35.700> my

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730 
then you look back and you realize oh my

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.450 
then you look back and you realize oh my
god<00:07:36.000> I'm<00:07:36.270> actually<00:07:36.600> doing<00:07:37.020> it<00:07:37.320> I'm<00:07:37.740> doing<00:07:38.010> it

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
god I'm actually doing it I'm doing it

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.830 
god I'm actually doing it I'm doing it
the<00:07:38.730> thing<00:07:38.970> that<00:07:39.150> I<00:07:39.210> didn't<00:07:39.480> think<00:07:39.600> that<00:07:39.780> I

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
the thing that I didn't think that I

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.690 
the thing that I didn't think that I
could<00:07:40.020> do<00:07:40.170> oh<00:07:40.380> my<00:07:40.740> god<00:07:40.920> I'm<00:07:41.130> actually<00:07:41.280> living

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700 
could do oh my god I'm actually living

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.970 
could do oh my god I'm actually living
it<00:07:41.940> now<00:07:41.970> but<00:07:42.630> sometimes<00:07:43.110> that<00:07:43.320> takes<00:07:43.560> a<00:07:43.710> little

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:43.980 
it now but sometimes that takes a little

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.850 
it now but sometimes that takes a little
bit<00:07:44.130> up<00:07:44.280> you<00:07:44.850> gotta<00:07:45.120> fake<00:07:45.510> it<00:07:45.540> I'm<00:07:46.230> thinkin

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 
bit up you gotta fake it I'm thinkin

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.430 
bit up you gotta fake it I'm thinkin
