00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
corner where all that crap is another

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.340 
corner where all that crap is another
stack<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.390> 2<00:03:07.260> or<00:03:07.290> 3<00:03:07.590> 75<00:03:08.459> gallon<00:03:09.000> stands<00:03:09.570> or

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.050 
stack for 2 or 3 75 gallon stands or
tanks<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.520> said<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.790> done<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
tanks so when it's all said and done I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.350 
tanks so when it's all said and done I
should<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:15.200> six<00:03:16.489> tanks<00:03:17.489> down<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:18.090> probably

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
should have six tanks down here probably

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.740 
should have six tanks down here probably
so<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> that's<00:03:20.940> what's<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.300> on<00:03:21.510> down<00:03:21.720> here

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
too much convincing and she actually

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.640 
too much convincing and she actually
suggested<00:03:54.140> having<00:03:56.600> three<00:03:57.600> stands<00:03:57.900> versus<00:03:58.410> two
