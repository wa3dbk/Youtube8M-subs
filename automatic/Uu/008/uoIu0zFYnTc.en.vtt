00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.460
NIGEL: Hello and welcome to a new Dota 2 Report.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.160
I've caught up with the hero known as Axe.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.000
he's been clearing camps in the Radiant Jungle up to this point.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I hope to get a quick interview with him.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.160
Let's wait for him to finish off those creeps.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.180
Hello, thank you for your time, Axe.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760
AXE: Axe is Axe!

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.440
So you've been jungling here, how's that been going?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.920
How has the ability 'Counter Helix' helped you?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.940
It says here that it has a chance to activate when attacked.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.200
AXE: Axe.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.320
NIGEL: What items are you working on?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.640
AXE: AXE IS AXE!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.740
NIGEL: It is somewhat difficult to have a two-way conversation with someone

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.180
with a limited number of prerecorded responses.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.660
TERRORBLADE: Tell me about it.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.800
CM: Someday, I'll return to the Blueheart Glacier...

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.160
TERRORBLADE: GrrrrRRRRR!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.920
NIGEL: I guess I'll just have to, heh, accept this and move on, huh?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.980
WAH!

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.940
JUGGERNAUT: 'cus I'm freee...

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.200
free farming.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.040
Haha.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.240
RUBICK: And stay back, Tidehunter.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.060
You wouldn't want to die again, now would you?

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.180
TIDEHUNTER: No.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.520
RUBICK: Well, good.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.360
Ah ah ah...

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.400
TIDEHUNTER: Owie...

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.320
RUBICK: Getting good farm, Juggernaut?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.860
JUGGERNAUT: Yes. Good Farm. Very Rich.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.680
Purchased Boots of Phase.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.640
RUBICK: Great!

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.660
JUGGERNAUT: This conversation was likely very easy

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.380
to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.060
animate.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.300
KUNKKA: Hm hmm, fire bird ahoy!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.940
Brace, ha ha!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.240
Ha ha, yes!

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.400
It's almost time for the rune to spawn in the river.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.320
Hasty rune, indeed!

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.860
Ha HA!
