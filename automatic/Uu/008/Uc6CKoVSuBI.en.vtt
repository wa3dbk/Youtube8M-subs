Soundwave<00:02:27.180> who<00:02:27.360> latched<00:02:27.630> onto<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.110> satellite

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
Soundwave who latched onto a satellite

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.900 
Soundwave who latched onto a satellite
and<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> looked<00:02:29.069> very<00:02:29.160> similar<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and it looked very similar to the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.000 
and it looked very similar to the
picture<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> vsat<00:02:31.080> last<00:02:31.740> but<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:31.950> least

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
picture of the vsat last but not least

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.860 
picture of the vsat last but not least
was<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> Warthog<00:02:32.970> which<00:02:33.210> was<00:02:33.360> probably<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
was the Warthog which was probably the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
was the Warthog which was probably the
easiest<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.860> was<00:02:35.010> actual

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
easiest because there was actual

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.820 
easiest because there was actual
real-life<00:02:36.060> warthog<00:02:36.630> jets<00:02:36.900> used<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> first

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
real-life warthog jets used in the first

used<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.440> try<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.710> kill<00:02:41.190> Scorponok<00:02:41.940> which<00:02:42.240> is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
used to try and kill Scorponok which is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.990 
used to try and kill Scorponok which is
a<00:02:42.480> perfect<00:02:42.900> segue<00:02:43.080> into<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.740> class<00:02:43.980> setup<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
a perfect segue into the class setup the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.850 
a perfect segue into the class setup the
Scorpion<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.900> only<00:02:46.050> gun<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:46.650> any

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
Scorpion was the only gun that had any

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.380 
Scorpion was the only gun that had any
kind<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.250> connection<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> Transformers

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
kind of connection to the Transformers

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.570 
kind of connection to the Transformers
movies<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.170> connection<00:02:49.590> was<00:02:49.770> with<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
movies and that connection was with the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.520 
movies and that connection was with the
Scorponok<00:02:51.210> transformer<00:02:51.840> who<00:02:51.990> looked<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
Scorponok transformer who looked like a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.080 
Scorponok transformer who looked like a
scorpion<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> decided<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.819> with<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
scorpion so I decided to go with the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.449 
scorpion so I decided to go with the
scorpion<00:02:54.569> evo<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.590> scorpion<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.160> attached

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
scorpion evo on the scorpion I attached

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.130 
scorpion evo on the scorpion I attached
a<00:02:56.640> laser<00:02:56.850> sight<00:02:57.090> because<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.540> Transformers

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
a laser sight because the Transformers

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.800 
a laser sight because the Transformers
utilized<00:02:58.560> lasers<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.250> lot<00:02:59.880> whether<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:00.480> used

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
utilized lasers a lot whether it's used

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.900 
utilized lasers a lot whether it's used
as<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.020> weapon<00:03:01.260> or<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.800> scan<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> vehicle<00:03:02.520> or<00:03:02.670> even

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
as a weapon or to scan a vehicle or even

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.199 
as a weapon or to scan a vehicle or even
to<00:03:03.030> show<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.780> depiction<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.830> past<00:03:05.130> events<00:03:05.310> then

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
to show a depiction of past events then

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.670 
to show a depiction of past events then
I<00:03:06.240> have<00:03:06.390> extended<00:03:06.810> mags<00:03:06.990> on<00:03:07.260> there<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.650> well

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
I have extended mags on there as well

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.710 
I have extended mags on there as well
because<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.340> Transformers<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.240> very<00:03:09.510> large

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
because the Transformers have very large

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960 
because the Transformers have very large
magazines<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.620> actually<00:03:10.770> rarely<00:03:11.610> see

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
magazines and you actually rarely see

them reload they do

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.660

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
do it a couple times but it's very rare

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.060 
do it a couple times but it's very rare
then<00:03:15.480> my<00:03:15.660> secondary<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> small<00:03:16.710> because

single shock charge this made sense to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.449 
single shock charge this made sense to
add<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.900> because<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.380> Decepticon<00:03:37.860> shockwave

have<00:03:52.230> flak<00:03:52.470> jacket<00:03:52.830> on<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
have flak jacket on because the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.760 
have flak jacket on because the
Transformers<00:03:54.090> are<00:03:54.300> giant<00:03:55.080> heavily<00:03:55.440> armored

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
Transformers are giant heavily armored

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.650 
Transformers are giant heavily armored
robots<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.459> then<00:03:56.820> lightweight<00:03:57.180> made<00:03:57.390> sense

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
robots and then lightweight made sense

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.420 
robots and then lightweight made sense
because<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.200> do<00:03:58.260> move<00:03:58.530> pretty<00:03:58.800> fast<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.220> on

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
because they do move pretty fast but on

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.460 
because they do move pretty fast but on
top<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.820> they<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.480> always<00:04:00.720> falling<00:04:01.080> and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
top of that they are always falling and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.930 
top of that they are always falling and
jumping<00:04:01.770> off<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.920> huge<00:04:02.310> buildings<00:04:02.760> and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
jumping off of huge buildings and

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.670 
jumping off of huge buildings and
jumping<00:04:03.300> out<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.510> airplanes<00:04:03.630> onto<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> ground

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
jumping out of airplanes onto the ground

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.470 
jumping out of airplanes onto the ground
from<00:04:04.830> very<00:04:05.130> high<00:04:05.310> up<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.640> they<00:04:06.090> never<00:04:06.239> get

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
from very high up and they never get

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.880 
from very high up and they never get
hurt<00:04:06.660> which<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.140> second<00:04:07.470> half<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.709> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
hurt which is the second half of the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
hurt which is the second half of the
lightweight<00:04:08.220> perk<00:04:08.430> take<00:04:08.820> no<00:04:09.060> damage<00:04:09.360> win

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
lightweight perk take no damage win

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.750 
lightweight perk take no damage win
falling<00:04:10.110> finally<00:04:10.860> we<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.100> toughness<00:04:11.550> and

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
falling finally we have toughness and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.270 
falling finally we have toughness and
tactical<00:04:12.239> mask<00:04:12.450> take<00:04:13.290> less<00:04:13.530> flinch<00:04:13.860> one<00:04:14.040> shot

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
tactical mask take less flinch one shot

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.949 
tactical mask take less flinch one shot
and<00:04:14.459> reduces<00:04:14.940> effects<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.570> tactical

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
and reduces effects of tactical

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.449 
and reduces effects of tactical
equipment<00:04:16.200> both<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.739> these<00:04:16.830> made<00:04:17.070> sense<00:04:17.340> for

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
equipment both of these made sense for

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.729 
equipment both of these made sense for
giant<00:04:17.880> alien<00:04:18.180> robots<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.440> what<00:04:19.709> i

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
giant alien robots so that is what i
