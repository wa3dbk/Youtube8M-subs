not one in this area and this is the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.400 
not one in this area and this is the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
area where the head gaskets always leak

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.060 
area where the head gaskets always leak
you<00:03:13.799> can<00:03:13.950> see<00:03:14.220> where<00:03:15.799> there's<00:03:16.799> been

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
you can see where there's been

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.160 
you can see where there's been
compression<00:03:17.940> passing<00:03:18.450> through<00:03:18.690> under<00:03:18.959> this

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
compression passing through under this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.930 
compression passing through under this
one<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.620> blowing<00:03:19.920> out<00:03:20.040> into<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.609> which<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
one and blowing out into here which is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.220 
one and blowing out into here which is
blowing<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> smoke<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.840> through<00:03:22.519> here

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
blowing the smoke out through here

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.369 
blowing the smoke out through here
and<00:03:26.209> she<00:03:27.209> knows<00:03:27.360> some<00:03:27.569> other<00:03:27.780> places<00:03:28.020> down

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
and she knows some other places down

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.199 
and she knows some other places down
here<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.800> looks<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.010> part<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.459> my<00:03:29.580> guess<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
here it looks like part of my guess is

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.449 
here it looks like part of my guess is
over<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.260> part<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.560> its<00:03:31.709> over<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.190> so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
over here and part of its over here so

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.020 
over here and part of its over here so
this<00:03:33.300> gasket<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:34.190> bad<00:03:35.190> I've<00:03:35.489> got<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.640> new<00:03:35.879> one

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
this gasket so bad I've got a new one

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.199 
this gasket so bad I've got a new one
