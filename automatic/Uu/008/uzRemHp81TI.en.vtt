00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.429

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.880
 the toilet paper roll looks out 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.890
 the larger piece of paper you sweep 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.920
 with glue and want the paper roll 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 in it and stick it firmly the same 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.950
 you do with the narrower 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.440
 paper strip then your in the middle 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.850

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.190

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.930

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 You simply wrap the paper strips 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 around a circular object, either a 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.510
 pen or like this little one here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.510

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.130

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.360
