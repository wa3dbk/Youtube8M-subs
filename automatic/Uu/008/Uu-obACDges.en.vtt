00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.520
 good guys and girls and we are here 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.630
 showing a trick of gifted how 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.460
 block the scripts 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 now what is needed to do this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 blog you need to have someone who 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.410
 defend the line in this case would be 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 good 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.780
 acz 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 it would also be good 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.620
 a type of light and gamble 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 and to lock a clips the 36 that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.670
 we are now seeing what you need 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.840
 buy the dry one leaf mitigating 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 a wheeling lake is that and about 4 or 5 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.199
 Mana pots now what you need to do 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 is to get in here is the line that 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.949
 is already naturally open on the map 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.220
 from the aliens on the side of the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.870
 radiant 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.270
 how can they stay from the first 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.660
 keep watching until they see that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.110
 those for those who are and I commented to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.600
 side of a tree entrance 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.370
 now they are cutting the idea cut as much 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.640
 as fast as you can before the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.640
 clips 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.920
 I also recommend that you buy some 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.170
 144 a couple of any is enough 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 to put it from him so they see the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 runes of tops because they can 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 anchor the very easy because this is already 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 a trick like that well known and apart 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.640
 suspected that you can not see the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.040
 clips from the other side enemy 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.090
 ok here are the clips that have 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.650
 what to do next to the entrance 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 to see how they see now do not block the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.970
 entry until they pass and then 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.090
 position yourself in a way that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.979
 block the entrance 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.420
 there they see that those who remain unemployed 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.289
 they totally do nothing to wait because 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.289
 they have no way out 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.760
 always try the week just throw 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.690
 in the cube 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.530
 then wait for the other 30 seconds 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.110
 they wait for the clips to go back to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.110
 zoom in and continue to do this method 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.410
 until a quantity arrives 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.860
 this acceptable amount of 4 stacks 5 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.560
 foreign 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.830
 in which the chs is already stopping the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.830
 line 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 now at minute 4 34 minutes 30 seconds 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.080
 they have to let the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.030
 come out the scripts 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.710
 because they started making the trees and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.890
 they are going to block and they do not go and what they have 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.569
 done will not do any good 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.209
 what is the good thing this trick that the line 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.790
 of top that is the team's easy time 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.440
 you will not receive any experience in 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.730
 change what you will receive goes to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.220
 receive all the gold experience 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.680
 energy that will not receive either 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.220
 experience nor gold but after this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.190
 of the bus from the way of clips that goes 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 to push the whole line top the same will be 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.170
 pretty easy now see what what 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.450
 happened here in this play in what more 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.020
 he realized what is happening me 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.360
 I imagined that the one that I approach 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.900
 crossing was trying to return 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.500
 is to do the stack again but 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.500
 but that is determined to damage it in the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 trick 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.959
 okay is where the clicks are coming 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:29.090
 we made a stack of around 33 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.950
 these four taxis do not remember it well 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.950
 how many are we 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.670
 see how little we did because it 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.550
 they gave an account in the enemy team 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.590
 We could destroy the two towers of 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.430
 top and do a little bit of damage to the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 top line of the base 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.690
 and well basically this is all that 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.690
 they have to do 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.940
 always keep the pressure against them 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.680
 and position in good watts in the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.030
 rounds of top so we do not get what 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.990
 as we process leaving the rest 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.990
 with the rest have a good afternoon 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 morning 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.210
 I was already flying 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.320
 Water 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.160
 more in less 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.250
 bye
