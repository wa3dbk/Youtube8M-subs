a<00:03:48.010> lot<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.580> for<00:03:48.790> example<00:03:48.850> pitch<00:03:49.300> perfect<00:03:49.750> on

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
a lot like for example pitch perfect on

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.990 
a lot like for example pitch perfect on
devious<00:03:50.290> 13<00:03:50.710> pounds<00:03:51.160> with<00:03:51.280> fifty<00:03:51.610> percent<00:03:51.790> off

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
devious 13 pounds with fifty percent off

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.150 
devious 13 pounds with fifty percent off
and<00:03:52.240> on<00:03:52.750> blu-ray<00:03:53.050> it's<00:03:53.200> 14<00:03:53.560> pounds<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.830> 50<00:03:53.950> per

and on blu-ray it's 14 pounds to 50 per
set<00:03:54.280> up<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.550> think<00:03:54.730> they're<00:03:54.850> going<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.060> drop<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
set up I think they're going to drop the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480 
set up I think they're going to drop the
prices<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.930> 13<00:03:56.380> files<00:03:56.560> for<00:03:56.740> DVD<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.130> wasn't

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
prices like 13 files for DVD it wasn't

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.460 
prices like 13 files for DVD it wasn't
that<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.640> basically<00:03:58.510> they've<00:03:58.900> upped<00:03:59.170> their

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
that it basically they've upped their

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.620 
that it basically they've upped their
prices<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.280> then<00:04:00.610> put<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> percentage<00:04:01.180> off<00:04:01.480> on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
prices and then put a percentage off on

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.850 
prices and then put a percentage off on
it<00:04:01.750> which<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.020> stupid<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.380> lot<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.710> eight

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
it which is stupid a lot of the eight

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.590 
it which is stupid a lot of the eight
pound<00:04:03.130> DVDs<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:03.700> could<00:04:03.940> see<00:04:04.090> Anthony<00:04:04.420> for

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
pound DVDs you could see Anthony for

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.360 
pound DVDs you could see Anthony for
originally<00:04:04.960> four<00:04:05.170> or<00:04:05.320> five<00:04:05.500> pounds<00:04:05.890> but

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
originally four or five pounds but

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.560 
originally four or five pounds but
they've<00:04:06.520> upped<00:04:06.730> them<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.180> they<00:04:07.300> can<00:04:07.330> put

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
they've upped them so they can put

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.450 
they've upped them so they can put
seventy<00:04:07.960> percent<00:04:08.020> off<00:04:08.410> which<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.740> don't<00:04:08.920> think

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
seventy percent off which I don't think
