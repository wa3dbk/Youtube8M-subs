00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:16.100
 I apply a face primer to minimize 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:18.019
 pores and uniform the complexion I do the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.869
 base with airbrush mixing 2 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.590
 foundation nebulizing there with little ones 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.590
 circular movements 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 apply illuminating on cheekbones e 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.440
 on the bow of cupid 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.500
 with a cold brown I do the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.110
 contouring under the cheekbone on the sides of the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.489
 nose to the sides of the temples since later 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.489
 we're going to tie our hair 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.259
 AP pressing drums for this cheat 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.259
 last longer 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.780
 apply a black pencil to the eyelid 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.119
 mobile that unfortunately is not much fades 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.539
 but I will still need it just like 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.539
 basis 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.010
 bathroom with the fix plus a beautiful 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.729
 electric blue pigment and I apply it to the 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.729
 center of the eyelid 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.530
 I note a black eyeshadow and faded ie 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.810
 the vice that at the end of the eye 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.810
 thus creating the electric blue light point 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.240
 intermediate colombarone I blur the i 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.220
 the make up borders will reopen once in a while 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.220
 black on the edges 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.580
 I apply the black eyeshadow also on the rhymes 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.220
 opens with a beautiful copper pigment 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.180
 wet only on the first part of the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.180
 lower rhythm 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.250
 I chose this color because it creates a 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.019
 nice contrast with the blue being a 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.510
 color complementary to the wheel of 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:35.790
 colors I apply a light veil of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:39.829
 eyeliner between the lashes put some 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.829
 fake eyelashes quite natural 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.590
 camouflages the lash line 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.590
 fake with wool 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.329
 as my usual redefine the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.329
 eyebrows with the lerner in cake 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.010
 I outline the lips with one 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.630
 pink pencil and fill them with a 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.630
 lipstick mat of the same shade
