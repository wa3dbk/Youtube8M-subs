gonna<00:02:59.370> say<00:02:59.609> too<00:02:59.670> much<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.180> here<00:03:00.389> about<00:03:00.599> my

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
gonna say too much on here about my

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
gonna say too much on here about my
thoughts<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.170> well<00:03:01.349> back<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:02.010> he<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.849> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
thoughts on well back but he is on the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.860 
thoughts on well back but he is on the
bench<00:03:03.389> and<00:03:03.889> I<00:03:04.889> prefer<00:03:05.519> Hernandez<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.420> Rooney

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
bench and I prefer Hernandez and Rooney

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.740 
bench and I prefer Hernandez and Rooney
in<00:03:07.049> my<00:03:07.200> opinion<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.609> just<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.299> think<00:03:09.480> that

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
in my opinion and I just I think that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.149 
in my opinion and I just I think that
team<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.019> going<00:03:10.139> to<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.319> probably<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.859> first

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
team is going to be probably the first

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.640 
team is going to be probably the first
one<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.670> me<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.940> finish<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.109> think<00:03:13.590> I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
one for me to finish because I think I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.440 
one for me to finish because I think I
only<00:03:13.769> have<00:03:13.920> two<00:03:14.129> or<00:03:14.310> three<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.849> substitute

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
only have two or three more substitute

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
only have two or three more substitute
spots<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.139> team<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.530> finish<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:18.000> then

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
spots of that team to finish and then

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.659 
spots of that team to finish and then
that's<00:03:18.359> me<00:03:18.599> done<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.079> dusted<00:03:19.349> then<00:03:19.739> he<00:03:20.400> wanted

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
that's me done and dusted then he wanted

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.400 
that's me done and dusted then he wanted
David<00:03:20.879> Luiz<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.269> Cahill<00:03:21.780> those<00:03:21.989> were<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.230> two

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
David Luiz and Cahill those were the two

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.530 
David Luiz and Cahill those were the two
players<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.799> he<00:03:23.129> wanted<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.459> pick<00:03:23.639> up<00:03:23.790> there

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
players that he wanted to pick up there

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.030 
players that he wanted to pick up there
were<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.660> couple<00:03:24.750> more<00:03:25.349> as<00:03:25.530> well<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.949> you'll

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
were a couple more as well and you'll

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.129 
were a couple more as well and you'll
see<00:03:26.220> me<00:03:26.370> trade<00:03:26.609> those<00:03:26.790> over<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.269> end<00:03:27.419> but

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
see me trade those over at the end but

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.830 
see me trade those over at the end but
yeah<00:03:28.379> I<00:03:28.410> gave<00:03:28.650> over<00:03:28.829> my<00:03:29.099> David<00:03:29.489> Luiz<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.060> in

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
yeah I gave over my David Luiz and in

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.319 
yeah I gave over my David Luiz and in
return<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.440> got<00:03:31.620> another<00:03:32.099> duplicate<00:03:32.579> actually

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
return I got another duplicate actually

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.360 
return I got another duplicate actually
again<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.750> kind<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.989> shows<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
again it kind of shows that I was I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
again it kind of shows that I was I
maybe<00:03:35.669> wasn't<00:03:35.879> paying<00:03:36.239> full<00:03:36.389> attention<00:03:36.449> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
maybe wasn't paying full attention and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.509 
maybe wasn't paying full attention and
I've<00:03:37.410> kind<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.650> learned<00:03:37.799> my<00:03:37.949> lesson<00:03:38.310> from<00:03:38.340> that
