00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
yet you'd kill them and they would be a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
yet you'd kill them and they would be a
from<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> game<00:00:52.710> permanently<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.820> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
from the game permanently or they just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850 
from the game permanently or they just
straight-up<00:00:54.360> leave<00:00:54.809> okay<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> makes<00:00:55.770> your

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
straight-up leave okay and it makes your

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
straight-up leave okay and it makes your
choices<00:00:56.219> matter<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.690> and

I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> best<00:00:58.739> thing<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.949> could<00:00:59.100> have

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
I think it's the best thing I could have

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.470 
I think it's the best thing I could have
done<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.760> always<00:00:59.850> my<00:00:59.940> problems

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
of Mass Effect is they say that the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.680 
of Mass Effect is they say that the
choice<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> matter<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.539> don't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that's probably the best thing they

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
that's probably the best thing they
could<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.119> done<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.450> new<00:02:00.630> characters<00:02:01.049> some

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740

work some don't work it's just potato
powder<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.670> basically<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.079> it's

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
powder so so basically it's it's a it's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
powder so so basically it's it's a it's
a<00:02:07.500> Bioware<00:02:08.069> RPG<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.789> long<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.090> they're<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
a Bioware RPG as long as they're kind of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.180 
a Bioware RPG as long as they're kind of
standard<00:02:09.929> fighting<00:02:10.319> formula<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
standard fighting formula like the the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710 
standard fighting formula like the the
Fighting's<00:02:11.550> been<00:02:12.030> changing<00:02:12.420> except<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Fighting's been changing except for the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.220 
Fighting's been changing except for the
healing

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
healing

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.990 
healing
right<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.489> play<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
right it's so it's you can play as a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.339 
right it's so it's you can play as a
tactical<00:02:15.360> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.599> Turnberry<00:02:15.870> strategy<00:02:16.230> game

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
tactical kind of Turnberry strategy game

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.630 
tactical kind of Turnberry strategy game
if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> wish<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.709> play<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.069> way<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.489> there's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
if you wish to play that way but there's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.670 
if you wish to play that way but there's
no<00:02:17.819> real<00:02:18.030> punishment<00:02:18.599> or<00:02:19.080> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> advantage

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
no real punishment or kind of advantage

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
no real punishment or kind of advantage
for<00:02:19.799> doing<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.730> basically<00:02:21.030> comes<00:02:21.269> down

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
for doing it so it basically comes down

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.119 
for doing it so it basically comes down
to<00:02:21.599> how<00:02:22.049> much<00:02:22.230> I'm<00:02:22.440> gonna<00:02:22.530> invest<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
to how much I'm gonna invest in the

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.490 
to how much I'm gonna invest in the
consequences<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.790> my<00:02:23.879> actions<00:02:23.909> yes<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
consequences of my actions yes and I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.589 
consequences of my actions yes and I
guess<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> characters<00:02:26.459> yes<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.510> I'm

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
guess the characters yes and so if I'm

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.030 
guess the characters yes and so if I'm
not<00:02:27.720> gonna<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:28.019> either<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.290> those<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.769> still

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
not gonna do either of those is it still

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.530 
not gonna do either of those is it still
worth<00:02:29.190> recommending<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.819> think<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> good

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
worth recommending I think it's a good

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.270 
worth recommending I think it's a good
game<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:30.989> it's<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.170> game<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:31.860> gonna<00:02:32.010> stick

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
game I think it's a game I'm gonna stick

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.670 
game I think it's a game I'm gonna stick
with<00:02:32.310> until<00:02:32.730> which<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.330> freak<00:02:33.510> comes<00:02:33.720> out<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.319> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
with until which a freak comes out so I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.110 
with until which a freak comes out so I
said<00:02:35.400> look<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.970> worth<00:02:36.090> checking

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
said look I think it's worth checking

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.369 
said look I think it's worth checking
it's<00:02:36.510> probably<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> best

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
it's probably the but it's the best

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.170 
it's probably the but it's the best
thing<00:02:37.530> buy<00:02:37.680> we've<00:02:37.890> done<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.129> a<00:02:38.220> long<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:39.120> so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
thing buy we've done in a long time so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.960 
thing buy we've done in a long time so
so<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.049> we<00:02:40.200> call<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.280> best<00:02:41.519> genuinely

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
so that's we call so the best genuinely

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.550 
so that's we call so the best genuinely
you<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.510> best<00:02:42.690> thing<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.140> by<00:02:43.349> way<00:02:43.530> of
