00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in every kind of animal whether dogs cats 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 golden eagles or humans are almost there 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.400
 as many males as females why 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.099
 is that so 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.830
 why is not there a species 30 ? 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.800
 male and 70 percent female why 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.800
 it is always almost exactly 50 5 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.230
 good with us people from today 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.150
 Western view in monogamy 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.769
 So there is a single one 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
 reproductive partner is the rule 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.180
 you can understand that relatively there 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 as many men as women 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.660
 but they are needed for reproduction 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.210
 Let's take a look at the example 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.489
 Choice of these also live with a 50 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.739
 50 gender relationship but that 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.390
 most people die without themselves 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.120
 ever before plant have become 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.190
 almost all females only mate 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.620
 small part of the male mates with 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.330
 all female colleagues being the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.129
 most people go out empty why 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.229
 are there so many people at all? 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.299
 they are also food and resources 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.040
 But consume in the evolutionary sense 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.449
 actually fulfill no purpose because they 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.059
 do not reproduce from the viewpoint of 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.409
 Species it would be much more effective if 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 only a small part of the population 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.729
 being male and many being female 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.710
 As you are thus available to you 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.259
 much better use of available resources 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.270
 can and an inefficient 50 50 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.720
 displace populations relatively quickly 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.159
 would 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.439
 Let's imagine a walrus 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.049
 population in front of ten percent 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.060
 male and 90 percent female 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.310
 the problem is that this kind of 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.719
 distribution over many generations not 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.729
 would remain stable 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.560
 why not in the example would be 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.929
 every male on average 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.689
 thus, new females mate 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.539
 male nine times as many follow as 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.939
 a female, however, it is now the 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.990
 revolutionary meaningful sons more than 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.030
 to father daughters 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.969
 because one can assume that male 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.649
 pass on their genes nine times as often as 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.929
 female and that's what you want his 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.670
 genes are redistributed as often as possible 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.069
 adopted in one was from the male 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.539
 a mutation would occur over 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.490
 many generations away 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.130
 probably that's for example 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.749
 produce more sperm with y chromosomes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 So lets with a higher 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.979
 Probability male descendants 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.930
 To generate this mutation would be 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.790
 insanely fast spread since the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.650
 anyway, already large spread of the dna 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.300
 the monks are further strengthened 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.970
 This would be the ratio 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890
 over time back to 50 50 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 commutes with sea ​​females it would be exactly 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.340
 the same effect and you can do that too 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.120
 again other species and also on the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.620
 people transfer 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.530
 You could say that every deviation 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.740
 from the north the effects amplified the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.660
 again the normal 50 50 condition 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.610
 would produce in every situation 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 there will be few people 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.560
 automatically evolutionary sense 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.880
 to have many male succession and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.050
 thus, the relationship is back to normal 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.400
 one is the same 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010
 gender distribution maybe not 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 the most effective but the most stable 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.490
 thank you for the attention that 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.050
 Blomqvist this week your criticism 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.790
