00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.850
 together we have our dell here 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.740
 inspiron 17 rsc and there just wanted 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.459
 let me show you the possibilities 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.709
 at the device and just open it 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.410
 so he is of course always battery out 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.790
 if you work on the device and have there 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.140
 It is also a very own one 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.120
 you have to come up with a mechanism 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.670
 to lift out from behind as soon as you can 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.530
 here the two closures solved then 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.790
 we come to the maintenance flap we have 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.340
 not just two screws which we 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.630
 have to solve 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.350
 and there is something under it 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.350
 the whole technique 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.940
 he jumps me a piece right away 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 Of course that is very contrary to that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 own and have a good grip 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.280
 is that you can open 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.019
 Here you can see already we have 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.370
 here the two memory modules with 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.589
 four gigabytes each so the two 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.030
 Memory module 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.460
 we have the big 1000 here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.509
 gigabyte hard drive can be without 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 exchange problems 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.340
 So not only here after 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 you can solve the mounting frame 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 take out complete hard drive and we 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.310
 have here as you can already see one 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 mounting frame available for a second 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.789
 hard disk of course with the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.399
 corresponding connection here below 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.440
 hiding speak second hard disk resp 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.750
 a ssd in addition or similar 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.399
 no problem 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 and what else we have in addition to the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.020
 both normal hard drives is one m 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 zara slot say you can 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.990
 theoretically be here in 1000 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 gigabyte builds you another 1000 here 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 gigabyte in and here's 128 gigabyte 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.039
 ssd then you have a super fast 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.050
 system with huge memory now only 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.330
 as an example or bordeaux for two ssds 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.369
 pure if you just really extremely 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.539
 want to have everything possible 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.020
 over the device so we have here 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.860
 Neat space for hard drives 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.950
 otherwise we only have that once again 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.470
 Wlan module in the case it is an intel 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.190
 you can module here theoretically 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.289
 change 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 I really need you, man 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.910
 probably not that one 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.160
 can exchange 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.849
 but at least it's good to know what's there 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.040
 but that is there is otherwise more 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.270
 options we do not have everything 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640
 You really have to do that for others 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.599
 open complete housing and that is 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.250
 stop a measure we do not 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.310
 just want to fulfill because then 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.900
 can redeem less and you can in it 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.160
 just broken out very quickly 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.959
 Message from a screwdriver 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.970
 slips off and already that is no-go 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.099
 over and over, of course not 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 Manufacturer if you yourself somewhere 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.620
 a defect causes so much to the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.650
 car possibilities we still do 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.270
 You have to come here again and again 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.640
 must be careful and served begin 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:54.340
 and then you can just do it in the end 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.050
 press one again and screw 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 tighten 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.730
 and then sets the whole already 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.730
 again 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120
 so 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:17.070
 just as I wrote them I found us 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:19.540
 not here and now he is again 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.090
 so much to the possibilities of 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.450
 Inspiron 17 years before marriage and then until 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.450
 next time
