00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:07.410
 welcome to the cs5 the top 5 features Med Rahman what 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.060
 First of all it is interesting that this is for mom and quotes immediately 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.569
 a preview can be seen that did not exist before 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.710
 furthermore or you activate several grams 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.519
 Johann pulls her apart 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.849
 then we got out of the so-called car Sixt 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.800
 at the moment it is so that everything is now granted net if I have the Hertha 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 is there Â»press 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 then the ice-fast trains will only be between the frames 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.130
 evenly pulled apart 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.460
 furthermore, if any frames raise, for example, a square 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.910
 Now it's out, Mander 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.310
 Clemens in the case box the whole straight just does she grace the whole thing 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.630
 Of course, even if you only raise a room like that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.150
 and duplicated it 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.910
 and stretches the mouse button will earn interest 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.610
 then you see that you 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.100
 Wittfoth also implies a wonderful function 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040
 when here make this warm market bigger 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 and lay down 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.600
 from the left and Utrecht 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 and want as this warm shares that it is also an outward new 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.150
 Function and also for button pressed nonsense that this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.190
 Chr frame activated what before so that you could not move it now 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.930
 you can not move it at all no problem 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.150
 that's it 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.390
 Antonelli is not that yet 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.590
 we have another great feature 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.510
 in the corners here you can also right here you can directly 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.620
 select more targeted 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.650
 or you can click here on this 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.350
 click small diamond 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.330
 and trade Rahman the experts 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.360
 round off directly 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590
 which, of course, is what the city calls the single act 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.020
 sio 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.160
 or so 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.630
 pressed shift and old grid 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.700
 that's wrong
