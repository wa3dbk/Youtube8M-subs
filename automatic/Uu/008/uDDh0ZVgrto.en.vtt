00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
so you see sentinels about average

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.420

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
have made him a Voyager would have been

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.740 
have made him a Voyager would have been
more<00:03:40.299> cool<00:03:40.599> so<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.560> see<00:03:41.890> this<00:03:42.549> goes<00:03:43.360> into<00:03:43.629> this

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
more cool so you see this goes into this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.430 
more cool so you see this goes into this
hand<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.840> sometimes<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.930> shield<00:03:47.170> Falls

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440
