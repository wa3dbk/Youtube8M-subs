00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi, we're back to talking about 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.849
 Let's talk about literature in books because 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.889
 this is the corner of fab's tips for 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 You read more and today I want to talk about 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 a book that I loved that I found this way 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 that everyone needed to read to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.460
 understand some of the political structure 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 the western and eastern part of the structure 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 human policy and, above all, 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.199
 communism on socialism and how 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 people got wrong with some 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.200
 concepts trying to make the human being 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.050
 something that he is not the book is the one here 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.940
 george orwell critters revolution 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 joel is a British journalist already dead 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.730
 This is it, he writes very well, I have 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 some of his books but so are two 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 which are very important that I think the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.149
 fact of the two today 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 one of them is the bug revolution here 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.180
 shows the description above , and thus 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 tired of the farm to which they are 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 submitted by humans the animals of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 of the site rebel against the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 owners and took possession of the farm with 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.689
 the objective of establishing a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.439
 cooperative under the slogan 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.390
 four legs good two legs bad but 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.400
 It does not take long for some bugs 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.479
 in particular the most intelligent 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 pigs again enjoy privileges 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.270
 gradually reintroducing a system of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 oppression 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 now is inspired by the motto all 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 animals are the same but some animals are 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.939
 more equal than others 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.340
 the history of the libertarian insurrection of 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.650
 animals is restricted in order to justify 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.920
 the new tyranny and the incidents 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.189
 disappears or the force is silenced 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 bug revolution and this book here 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.470
 transcends the historical milestones of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.770
 dictatorship is in this, is that right? 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.030
 so the law has complete conviction of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 which was one of the best books ever 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.869
 written on the subject and is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.299
 interesting because it is very ironic 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.270
 not imagine and put the pigs as 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.790
 symbol of the great communist leaders 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.159
 who after taking power and discovers 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.680
 that power and perks are good and hence 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.170
 they want communism only for the rest of the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.940
 people for them is not a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.420
 with our Brazilian policy is not a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.490
 satire very well 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.670
 george an incredible sense of humor one 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.830
 easy book he is very short of a 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.720
 Very nice nice read for anyone 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.610
 is studying to enter college 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 is also in the college to understand a 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.200
 some of that world socialism and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.670
 communism because both things sometimes 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.410
 they are much more alike than we are 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.600
 thinks 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.850
 strongly recommend the revolution of the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.340
 animals and even the same author I 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.250
 I also recommend the classic 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.140
 classic 1984 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.030
 you have heard this is the book 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 inspired big brother but so has nothing 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 to watch with me 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.110
 Big Brother of us is it was the fifth 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.120
 1984 when it was written was 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.630
 so far was a future where 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.360
 all humans were observed 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.370
 he also talks a lot about communism and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.100
 this oppression of the state on the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.230
 and how all people 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.830
 would be under surveillance would have to act 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.829
 in accordance with what has been 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.660
 dominant power and you never know who you are 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.690
 what are you watching then they called 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.579
 great brother the watcher is the greatest 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 brother is different from today we talk 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.329
 Big brother, he's called a drug. 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.459
 who is inside the house logic is the 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.890
 because in the book Big Brother is 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.329
 who observes people who live 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.989
 in that community 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.430
 people is an incredible book with the end to 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.150
 half of a player so I confess that 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.640
 I stayed 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.920
 to and in the sadness so you imagine that 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.609
 that would be so real some years 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.799
 then I think you should read 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.510
 same is the story of instinct he tries 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.850
 to rebel against the society of the time 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.040
 while this great domination but he 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.440
 understands after all that there is a 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.910
 control and that sometimes who wants to 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.500
 it reveals itself is not 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.380
 Good, I'll tell the story. 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.049
 You'll see, you'll be surprised. 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.000
 Jorge or you need to read is one of the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.139
 best writers of the century in my 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.670
 opinion is not because he is a journalist 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.350
 I'm not pulling sardines for my 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.880
 side but are two classics of 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.769
 literature you need to have that you 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.600
 you need to know that you need 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.489
 less obvious I know what it's about 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.090
 give a read you will like are books 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.150
 so very nice if you read 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.669
 two entries one sitting here is worth the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.020
 to know a little more about the work of 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.820
 george ball 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.860
 these were my reading tips 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.930
 This week I hope you read it later. 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.800
 You write down here for me to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.729
 tell you if you like it and enjoy it 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.070
 share the people continue 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.530
 talking and publicizing this project 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.530
 because the important thing is that you read more
