00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 in this issue we will tell you about 8 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.470
 the wonders of nature that people are not in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.490
 able to explain 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.540
 in the first funnel to the hills mode baldy 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 sand dunes of the southern shore of the lake 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 michigan travel compilers 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 guide books are called live every turn 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 home moves a couple of meters but in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 this is nothing mysterious for a long time 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 it is known that the cause of movement is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 wind however none of the specialists yet 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 can't explain the mysterious 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 riot ability to swallow people in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 last year's six year old over 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 investor world collapsed in diameter 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
 about three meters suddenly 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.710
 formed directly below it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.480
 boy managed to get out of the sand 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 captivity needed rescue teams 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 excavators and more than three hours of time 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 second eye sugar structure rishat 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 also known as eye sahara 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 curious geological formation 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 approximately 50 meters in diameter 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.579
 which lie at the middle of the desert 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 from a height 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 the eye looks like concentric circles 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 of all shades of blue it was previously thought that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 the rishat structure emerged as a result 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 meteorite fall 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 but recent studies prove that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.180
 this is not the case in meteorites 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 craters and there are various 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 silicon compounds and in the eye sugar and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.260
 nothing like the third 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.119
 blocked rocks rocks 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.100
 located in deserts often covered 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.380
 varnish- like substance of various 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.689
 shades from light orange to black 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 ancient people scratched and varnished

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 art objects cave artists 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.600
 located around the world but no matter how 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 strange scientists still don't know 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 probably where the lacquer comes from 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.180
 coating alone scientists believe that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 substance appeared as a result of leaching 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.619
 some chemical compounds and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.869
 rock and others are sure that the varnish 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.400
 formed and sitting some dust but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 convincing evidence of such 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 there are no versions in the fourth morning nku 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.670
 the last eruption of the volcano morning nku 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 located in the southeastern part 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 Bolivia happened about 300 thousand years 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 back but a giant height of 6 kilometers to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.579
 so far scientists are surprised at satellite 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 observations, researchers found that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.810
 its underground cavities are filled with magma 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 about ten times faster than 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 similar fire-breathing mountains as a result 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.020
 hyperactivity turun that terrain in 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.819
 about 70 kilometers around the volcano 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.950
 annually becomes a couple of centimeters 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.569
 higher geomorphology most closely 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.609
 form 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.709
 watching this process judging by 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.569
 all started relatively recently but 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.749
 what was the reason for it all this 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.269
 will end until it is not clear 5 massive 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.219
 Permian extinction ecological 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.590
 disaster happened at the end of Perm 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.329
 period does not rest by a paleontologist 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.359
 the reason for which in a short time 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.400
 93 to 97 percent of all extinct 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.500
 biological species still remains 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.389
 for scientists a mystery one of the most 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.040
 popular versions says that big 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.599
 part of mortal life was destroyed in 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.790
 the result of the fall of a huge meteorite 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.560
 but weighty evidence of this is not yet 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.419
 found supporters of another theory 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.250
 suggest that the blame can be 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.319
 unique volcanic activity 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.849
 because of which caught fire in the vast 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.590
 coal deposits that in their 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.230
 the queue caused the greenhouse effect and 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.590
 sharp rise in lake temperature 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.540
 Hillier was discovered in 1802 in 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.489
 one of the australian deserts since 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.260
 scientists are unsuccessfully trying to understand what 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.810
 caused by an unusual bright pink color 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.760
 the pond killer is not the only pink 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.319
 lake in the world but if on other occasions 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.599
 glamorous shade of water due 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.040
 the presence of shrimp and microorganisms like 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.060
 in lake pink located in the state 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.799
 western australia 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.989
 or seaweed in like senegalese 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.810
 will flee by the healer does not disclose yet 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.090
 the researchers of their pink secrets here 7 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.169
 crust cracks 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.220
 from time to time in various corners 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.470
 of our planet 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.389
 huge cracks appear which 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.459
 scientists call the greatest tectonic 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.169
 paradox transformation normal 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.120
 faults must be present 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.689
 heights between scattered edges a 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.370
 there are no sudden cracks 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.290
 besides the appearance of ragged wounds on 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.659
 the earth’s surface is usually accompanied 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.430
 earthquakes but in areas of education 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.349
 mysterious seismic cracks 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.329
 activity is not observed some 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.009
 eyewitnesses cracks mark 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.840
 that at this time heard strange 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.299
 underground hum source that scientists 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.939
 also unknown yet 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.799
 8 Messina peak salinity around six 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.750
 million years ago the mediterranean sea 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.939
 dried up and more than 600 thousand years 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.859
 actually turned into this desert 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.689
 period scientists call the messianic peak 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.909
 salinity is the most likely cause 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.590
 descent and mediterranean bath 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.199
 considered blocking messages between 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.909
 sea ​​areas and Atlantic waters but what 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.910
 I summoned by experts
