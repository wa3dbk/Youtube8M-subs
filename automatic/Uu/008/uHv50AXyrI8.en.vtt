00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 God only gets through the whole 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:15.120
 right chicken eyes hello friends and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.580
 Welcome back to the new 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 follow kwik fit from leave it and that 's it 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 I left the training last week 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.050
 The fridge was empty and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.210
 I really wanted something else 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 protein-containing food may be something 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 carbohydrates has little fat all 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.179
 Minerals and nutrients I like that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 needed above all after training 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.469
 also essential amino acids that mine 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.399
 muscles grow well and are well supplied 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 and I remembered that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.000
 There used to be everything and everything 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.760
 what is really needed here are two eggs 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 and another banana that needs banana 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 you just crush it that way 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 real banana music together with the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.620
 Stir well and then a bowl 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.629
 So do you one or two phones in the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020
 principle pancake the bit smaller 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.439
 are 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.090
 the can you eat two eggs and a 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.380
 banana give about two to three 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.090
 pancakes have 20 percent protein so 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.770
 About ten to 15 grams of protein 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 we have carbohydrates through the banana 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 a lot of magnesium and I like that in the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 already said last videos 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.860
 Eight essential amino acids by the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.090
 Banana can be as essential as it already is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.939
 give says only by the food 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 be recorded 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 you need two minutes and harbor 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 rich good purpose after the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 Of course, training could do the same 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 make breakfast as a small protein 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.810
 I bombed the last one as well 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.110
 week very interesting conversation in the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.240
 Gym and that was about 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.540
 cardiac output body weight muscle percentage 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 like all to zams thick people relatively 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.799
 difficult to do sports because the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.219
 heartfirm hopefully sufficient 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.380
 the entire body with a whole body 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.060
 to supply blood and we are to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.159
 come naturally that it exactly 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.710
 so if you have a huge muscle mass 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.129
 has body as well as bodybuilders to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.550
 example that is also very harmful 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.880
 that's why the bodybuilders have 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.850
 from a certain age or from one 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.490
 certain problems can be extreme 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.200
 jog again but words on 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.640
 the treadmill like old women and of that 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 I just wanted to give you that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.360
 give information that if you 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.900
 someday it starts with some 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.570
 Substances antibiotics anabolics that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.440
 that is just as damaging in any case 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.970
 as if you are overweight so as 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.000
 obesity and hope that we with the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 information what to do then 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.260
 I wish you in any case 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.920
 Have a nice evening I hope you can 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.150
 what starts with the field of view writes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 below in the comments if you 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.960
 Of course you have any questions 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.970
 Also this dish will vary again 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.290
 You can also theoretically banana banana 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:17.590
 still apple with pure cut or even 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.890
 use both pieces with then hope 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.650
 I 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 you give in to it all 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.730
 feedback subscribes to our channel if 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.700
 you continue very many horny 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.510
 want to watch videos and see you 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.510
 next time then
