a special type of drafting pen called a

a special type of drafting pen called a
repeater<00:01:40.300> graph<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.880> rapidity<00:01:43.179> graphs

working on and the and they clog and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.620 
working on and the and they clog and
then<00:02:04.810> they<00:02:04.960> let<00:02:05.470> loose<00:02:05.829> all<00:02:06.159> at<00:02:06.340> once<00:02:06.630> we've

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
then they let loose all at once we've

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.759 
then they let loose all at once we've
spots<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.920> drops<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.759> ink<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.299> your<00:02:10.329> work<00:02:10.869> but

spots and drops of ink on your work but

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.910 
spots and drops of ink on your work but
you<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.070> try<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> find<00:02:12.640> ways<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.120> cover<00:02:13.360> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you have to try to find ways to cover up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
you have to try to find ways to cover up
I'm<00:02:14.920> using<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:15.640> using<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.290> latest

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
I'm using now using the latest

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.470 
I'm using now using the latest
equivalent<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.150> their<00:02:20.140> piteå<00:02:20.500> graph

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
equivalent of their piteå graph

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.839 
equivalent of their piteå graph
which<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:23.120> disposable<00:02:24.120> drafting<00:02:24.690> marker

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
which is the disposable drafting marker

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.630 
which is the disposable drafting marker
very<00:02:26.849> heavy<00:02:27.150> pen<00:02:27.950> she<00:02:28.950> used<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:29.549> more

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

very heavy pen she used to get some more
thicker<00:02:30.319> branches<00:02:31.319> I'm<00:02:31.680> actually<00:02:31.799> doing<00:02:32.069> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
thicker branches I'm actually doing the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.610 
thicker branches I'm actually doing the
trees<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.000> foreground<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> image<00:02:34.110> in

silhouette

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.630 

kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.850> overlapping<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.690> building<00:02:51.550> kind<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
kind of overlapping the building kind of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.490 
kind of overlapping the building kind of
the<00:02:52.730> way<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.060> building<00:02:53.450> actually<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:54.080> there's

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
the way the building actually is there's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.660 
the way the building actually is there's
a<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:55.610> beautiful<00:02:56.860> stretch<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.890> trees<00:02:58.430> in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
a really beautiful stretch of trees in

in<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.409> really<00:03:06.680> nice<00:03:06.860> way

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.390 

i'm<00:03:14.239> using<00:03:14.659> the<00:03:14.750> larger<00:03:15.200> darker<00:03:15.709> trees<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
i'm using the larger darker trees on the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.809 
i'm using the larger darker trees on the
ends<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.540> kind<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.019> device<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.819> draw

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
ends it's a kind of a device to draw

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.899 
ends it's a kind of a device to draw
your<00:03:20.030> eye<00:03:20.060> back<00:03:20.450> into<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> drawing<00:03:21.230> i<00:03:22.239> like

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
your eye back into the drawing i like

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.960 
your eye back into the drawing i like
how<00:03:25.909> these<00:03:26.150> trees<00:03:26.480> break<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.959> image<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.970> make

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
how these trees break the image up make

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.809 
how these trees break the image up make
it<00:03:29.000> look<00:03:29.180> more<00:03:29.510> natural<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:31.400> front<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.760> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
it look more natural in front of the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.490 
it look more natural in front of the
building<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.390> basically<00:03:32.629> just<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.290> row<00:03:33.470> of

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
building is basically just a row of
