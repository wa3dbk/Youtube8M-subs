00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 it's mike tyson gay hit his trip 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.070
 intimate this neighborhood in police zone and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:20.550
 torched a dumpster they also go for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:23.610
 my lighter for the wrist then as 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.240
 I told you about little games not the 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.240
 piece of rubber 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 it comes from decathlon you can 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.229
 find it for 8 or 10 euros so that's it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 so that's that little things thing 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:38.670
 to allow me to strengthen your wrists 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.289
 who are not made to order them 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.819
 on a wild girls who they are 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.159
 created forever in his stadium 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.179
 as we have all your body that 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.739
 are just on these small 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.109
 joints but you have to think 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.149
 really maximum reinforced to avoid 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.949
 all that is in 10 nitoo ski dislocation 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.959
 so I speak knowingly 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 Tendinitis on the udi of jeans at night 

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:58.109
 for a few months and I had a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.119
 also use at the wrist 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.350
 left for six months so I can 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.549
 tell you that it contained the ena in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.280
 the splints it's not practical for 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.450
 to make powers is even rather 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.980
 so there the exercises that I show you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 and that's really to be able to reinforce 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.430
 your baskets to the maximum 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 so if you are not going to ask questions 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240
 take a piece of something 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 just a room in the mouth 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.119
 and with that you will be able to do that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.189
 do exercises that I showed you 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:27.229
 so there is the better a recession says 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.820
 naji kg that you will have several 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.630
 colors I thought weapons up and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.409
 yellow or orange 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.420
 you'll see it's a weak one 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.399
 first exercise we take this like that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.009
 stuck with the foot and away from it 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.619
 Complete here we sense level 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.869
 wrists will have so first exercise 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.000
 go up and down so there you go 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.049
 to see how good it is at the level of 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.399
 wrists especially if you have any 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.780
 solutions at the united states level of 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.209
 things like that at the level neither fragile 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.770
 it's going to complicate the deal so that 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.840
 this is the first exercise the second 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.640
 exercise the second exercise so the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 same thing you always take your 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.390
 piece of rubber like this in your 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.850
 hands you sleep in front of here you have 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.560
 felt retention 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 at the troughs and you 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 go back up several times you do 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.380
 for example a series 10 have released a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.720
 second cellectis sa are you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.090
 quiet let us down so on 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.700
 okay so here you could do the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.070
 diff erent total to have different 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 tensions 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.540
 so that's the second exercise it's 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.000
 that you have third exercise so 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.810
 third exercise 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.160
 attention here and you go up there 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.830
 you will see that you have your 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.970
 wrists that work loves a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.490
 little bit but it's mostly for 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.460
 baskets so that's it that's the 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.710
 third exercise that you can have 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.120
 that you can do it for example with 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.920
 only one like that you'll be a little 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.510
 more power 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.690
 much the same thing we always take back 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.880
 in friendly the first exercise 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.170
 but if you want to stretch your 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.580
 fingers you put in tension you go 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.160
 leave believing circles of all 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.980
 shapes and you go back in the same 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.710
 same thing as the first exercise 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.220
 there you force for the second goat 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.550
 exercise 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.530
 parra was always doubling or raising a 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.060
 just be careful that you go back up the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.710
 way wrist and sign 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.970
 because it works well at the level of 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.500
 above the wrist so there you go 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 have all the muscles and ligaments 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.440
 who will work so that they can 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.900
 induce vomiting quietly same thing 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.940
 third for the third year 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.280
 exercise here always 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.300
 can you go up a little bit 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.400
 heavy to for is in tension 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.770
 and if you are going to work the same thing 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.830
 you have here all your ligaments and your 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 muscles that work so as to 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.820
 muscle if your cart why 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.860
 resume so waits once you 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.780
 did all your exercises with this 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.490
 little piece of rubber that you 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.220
 have worked my wrist one can also 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.990
 do complementary exercises so 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.580
 for example you like to points or 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.070
 injured and you can not do any 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.950
 against the mandates good you can very 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.690
 place your hands on the sides and 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.820
 try to work your pumps the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.549
 elbows closest to the body it's up to 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.790
 say here you go down and you go back 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.320
 here it build a little world that if you 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.540
 are ahead in relation to the risk a 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.220
 politely returned to the silhouette in 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.320
 upstream you really have to turn your 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.800
 body that comes from that one 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.020
 mounted 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.240
 but if you want to turn 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.520
 you put in position like that all of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.020
 following or creating something else you have a 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000
 cover fight after the structure in 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.919
 bomb shape in the vouvoyer if 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.949
 Geneva and tomorrow the engine I create a 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.330
 good sign here with defend and then 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.220
 if you are here still wanted the 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.680
 form answer but by cons you have 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.909
 a break at the level of the cash here with 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.479
 you at ligament two inches which 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.069
 spend here it's going to do a lot more 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.810
 wrong and it 'll be convenient for the body 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.090
 that here you have a better 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.280
 position and you can practice your 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.870
 accounts and reinforcements take more 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.280
 easily that it will hurt you less if 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.599
 in procession for all that for a 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.120
 word so I recall the position 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.300
 considers it right to try to get off the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.250
 more than body shots for me 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.020
 so here it's the same could do 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.110
 a lot of giving up like that that you 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.729
 would get me racing open then if by 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.360
 gold example right now you have 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.490
 really bad world if you are 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.900
 currently with tendinitis and you 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.879
 can not do reinforcements like 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.949
 that but good luck to you can 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.930
 turn completely there you'll see 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.520
 you to the etrat 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.770
 all ranges are other 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.199
 muscles that are here especially 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.400
 basically this one the one who 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.860
 is really a priority for 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.720
 orders all this part there really 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.669
 tried maximally reinforced if you 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.139
 are always rain if you have 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.090
 this one who takes but especially the 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.919
 tension behind me that's the one that 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.419
 is really important work so there 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.850
 you go to work you turn 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.199
 in round mode completely same thing of 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.600
 always balls towards the body is 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.259
 good and seems to you back to us 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.470
 so let's not hesitate to do 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.960
 this rare to these exercises there you there 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.060
 went with that more than I 'm going to you 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.389
 show on the exercise of shops or 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.389
 that he does
