00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:13.619

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.890
 The rumor was the Romario 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.899
 Yeah 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.290
 It is high speed well, but this is new 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.930
 In terms of legend categories 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 History of 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.320
 I climbed to 00:00 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.900
 In a Well three pattern card is the only Mario family of Romario 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 There are three types 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.090
 It looks like 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.800
 so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.329
 It is uniform 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.730
 Both three unlike 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.840
 Marukoi Yuuri and 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.320
 New category is 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:30.659
 Well there are 3 same players out 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.710
 Although I do not know why leave feeling like horse 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.930
 Maybe around 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 3 sheets 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.909
 It is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.430
 What sound and what 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:48.710
 I think it difficult but it also feeling Na or make a game 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:54.229
 of prima facie the heyday of the say all time legend Toka Legend system 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.229
 Kedomo'm a thing Tteyuu are Osu underground 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.690
 Naa way 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.630
 I say what I mean to distinguish put a differentiation 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.610
 But it looks interesting again 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.729
 Around Well, this time in the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.640

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.380
 It is said whether or not the Ovregendo will come out with other players 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.210

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.069
 Nankari over World mosquitoes that it is rumor 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:33.030
 Bédé Gender is nine themes 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.020
 I wonder if the bird is being thrown out 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.250
 It feels like that but it is amazing 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.860
 It means of the legend of the legend Thira Roh 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:50.070
 Nde is to say frame increases 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.490
 Is this more likely to hit a killer card than ever before ? 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.360
 If it does not change, it will be more difficult to complete than ever before 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.360
 It is 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.250
 Already 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.080
