your brush strokes what are you trying

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.060 
your brush strokes what are you trying

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it can be from something as simple as I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
it can be from something as simple as I
don't<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:42.000> much<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.600> brush

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
don't want to do much with my brush

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
don't want to do much with my brush
strokes<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.230> prefer<00:00:43.620> quiet<00:00:43.920> brush<00:00:44.309> strokes<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
strokes I prefer quiet brush strokes so

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
strokes I prefer quiet brush strokes so
that<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> painting<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> quiet<00:00:46.800> silkiness

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that the painting has a quiet silkiness

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.229 
that the painting has a quiet silkiness
about<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> boga<00:00:49.140> rose<00:00:49.320> paintings<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.239> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
about it like boga rose paintings and of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
about it like boga rose paintings and of
course<00:00:51.600> they're<00:00:51.840> absolutely<00:00:52.289> exquisite<00:00:52.920> but

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
course they're absolutely exquisite but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.319 
course they're absolutely exquisite but
they<00:00:53.219> don't<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.460> much<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> brush

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
they don't have much in the way of brush

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
they don't have much in the way of brush
strokes<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.920> brush<00:00:56.219> strokes

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
strokes or I want to have brush strokes

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200 
strokes or I want to have brush strokes
more<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.109> Schmidt<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> say

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
more like Schmidt or I was going to say

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
more like Schmidt or I was going to say
Richard<00:01:00.600> Schmidt<00:01:00.780> his<00:01:01.140> beautiful<00:01:01.500> brush

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
Richard Schmidt his beautiful brush

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
Richard Schmidt his beautiful brush
strokes<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:03.090> Rembrandt<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
strokes but really Rembrandt is what I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
strokes but really Rembrandt is what I
was<00:01:03.989> thinking<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.220> van<00:01:05.610> Gogh<00:01:05.880> where

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
was thinking of or like van Gogh where

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.770 
was thinking of or like van Gogh where
they're<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.689> bold<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.510> in<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.159> so

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
they're very bold and in like that so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.710 
they're very bold and in like that so
part<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.760> brush<00:01:14.760> strokes<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> probably

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
part one is brush strokes and probably

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
part one is brush strokes and probably
the<00:01:15.840> biggest<00:01:16.049> part<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> whole<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:16.799> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the biggest part of the whole thing is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
the biggest part of the whole thing is
your<00:01:17.490> brush<00:01:17.759> strokes<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> set<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
your brush strokes are going to set the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.730 
your brush strokes are going to set the
tone<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.640> individual<00:01:21.450> style<00:01:21.930> okay

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
tone for your individual style okay

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.340 
tone for your individual style okay
within<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:24.030> painting<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.600> there's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> lot

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
within your painting and there's a lot

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.630 
within your painting and there's a lot
of<00:01:25.470> other<00:01:25.619> elements<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.460> into

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of other elements that can go into

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.760 
of other elements that can go into
determining<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.720> style<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.290> brush<00:01:28.530> strokes

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
determining your style but brush strokes

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.719 
determining your style but brush strokes
is<00:01:28.920> definitely<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:30.060> part<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> equation

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
is definitely one part of that equation

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.740 
is definitely one part of that equation
so<00:01:32.729> um

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so um

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770 
so um
once<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.820> brush<00:01:36.150> strokes<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
once you have your brush strokes from a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.399 
once you have your brush strokes from a
style<00:01:37.170> perspective<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:39.090> maybe<00:01:39.810> even

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
style perspective down then maybe even

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.240 
style perspective down then maybe even
within<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> sub<00:01:42.630> category<00:01:43.470> underneath

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
within like a sub category underneath

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
within like a sub category underneath
that<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.759> would<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> function<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that there would be like a function of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.289 
that there would be like a function of
the<00:01:46.259> brush<00:01:46.470> strokes<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.640> example<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the brush strokes so for example in this

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
the brush strokes so for example in this
painting<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.290> wanted<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> show<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
painting here I just wanted to show you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
painting here I just wanted to show you
that<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.540> area<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that if you look at this area here

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
that if you look at this area here
obviously<00:01:52.770> there's<00:01:53.460> paint<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
obviously there's paint in here but you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
obviously there's paint in here but you
don't<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.979> same<00:01:56.219> kind<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> brush<00:01:57.299> strokes

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
don't see the same kind of brush strokes

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.459 
don't see the same kind of brush strokes
that<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.680> through<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.490> area<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that you see through this area so in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
that you see through this area so in
this<00:02:01.890> area<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:02.790> I've<00:02:02.969> done<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.420> I've<00:02:03.570> used

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
this area what I've done is I've used

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.730 
this area what I've done is I've used
thicker<00:02:04.409> paint<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.490> lights<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.740> thinner

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
thicker paint in the lights and thinner

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
thicker paint in the lights and thinner
paint<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.789> hard<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
paint it's hard to see because it's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
paint it's hard to see because it's
glare<00:02:09.989> they're<00:02:10.229> thinner<00:02:10.590> paint<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
glare they're thinner paint in the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.809 
glare they're thinner paint in the
shadow

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
shadow

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.289 
shadow
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.799> here<00:02:14.159> shadows<00:02:14.609> be<00:02:14.999> thinner

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and then like here shadows be thinner

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.690 
and then like here shadows be thinner
paint<00:02:15.569> there<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.019> then<00:02:16.590> thinner<00:02:17.099> paint<00:02:17.459> in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
paint there and then thinner paint in

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.830 
paint there and then thinner paint in
the<00:02:18.389> receding<00:02:18.959> areas<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.780> you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the receding areas here like this so you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.849 
the receding areas here like this so you
notice<00:02:22.139> the<00:02:22.200> difference<00:02:22.290> between<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
notice the difference between the

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.619 
notice the difference between the
thinner<00:02:23.069> paint<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.090> thicker<00:02:24.299> paint

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
thinner paint here and the thicker paint

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.470 
thinner paint here and the thicker paint
here<00:02:24.989> then<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.099> brushstrokes<00:02:26.969> really<00:02:27.389> is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
here then the brushstrokes really is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
here then the brushstrokes really is
what<00:02:27.629> I'm<00:02:27.749> trying<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.170> because<00:02:28.439> you<00:02:28.560> have<00:02:28.739> thin

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
what I'm trying to because you have thin

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.039 
what I'm trying to because you have thin
paint<00:02:29.189> and<00:02:29.400> still<00:02:29.639> have<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:30.120> look<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.959> a

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
paint and still have it have look of a

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.270 
paint and still have it have look of a
brushstrokes<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.859> can<00:02:31.980> have<00:02:32.069> thick

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
brushstrokes and you can have thick

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
brushstrokes and you can have thick
paint<00:02:32.579> where<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.269> all<00:02:33.480> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> smoothed

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
paint where it's all kind of smoothed

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
paint where it's all kind of smoothed
out<00:02:34.469> and<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.219> you<00:02:35.250> don't<00:02:35.609> have<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.760> really<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
out and it you don't have a really a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.270 
out and it you don't have a really a
feeling<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.719> brushstrokes<00:02:37.379> but<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.129> I'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
feeling of brushstrokes but what I'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.490 
feeling of brushstrokes but what I'm
using<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.849> brushstrokes<00:02:39.389> here<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.260> make

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
using the brushstrokes here is to make

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.800 
using the brushstrokes here is to make
these<00:02:41.219> areas<00:02:42.030> advanced<00:02:43.639> because<00:02:44.639> that's<00:02:45.480> what

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
these areas advanced because that's what

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.209 
these areas advanced because that's what
happens<00:02:46.349> when<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.680> thicker<00:02:46.919> brush

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
happens when you have thicker brush

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.449 
happens when you have thicker brush
strokes<00:02:47.489> they<00:02:47.609> pick<00:02:47.790> up<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.030> light<00:02:48.239> more<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
strokes they pick up the light more and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.490 
strokes they pick up the light more and
they<00:02:50.459> also<00:02:50.760> give<00:02:51.359> your<00:02:51.540> eye<00:02:51.599> something<00:02:52.319> in

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
they also give your eye something in

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.009 
they also give your eye something in
terms<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.639> third<00:02:54.030> dimension<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.689> kind<00:02:54.959> of

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
terms of a third dimension to kind of

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.640 
terms of a third dimension to kind of
focus<00:02:55.439> in<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.919> and<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.959> they<00:02:58.349> will<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
focus in on and so they will have a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.530 
focus in on and so they will have a
tendency<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.129> advance<00:02:59.699> these<00:02:59.939> thicker<00:03:00.209> brush

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
tendency to advance these thicker brush

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.080 
tendency to advance these thicker brush
strokes<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.989> well<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:03.439> B<00:03:04.439> as<00:03:04.620> well<00:03:05.189> as<00:03:05.430> reflect

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
strokes as well as B as well as reflect

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.869 
strokes as well as B as well as reflect
the<00:03:06.209> light<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.689> become<00:03:07.169> brighter<00:03:07.439> so<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.699> an

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
the light and become brighter so it's an

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.709 
the light and become brighter so it's an
attention-getting<00:03:09.659> device<00:03:10.049> as<00:03:10.349> well<00:03:10.859> as<00:03:10.919> a

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
attention-getting device as well as a

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.470 
attention-getting device as well as a
advise<00:03:12.719> to<00:03:13.049> UM<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.639> light<00:03:14.849> look<00:03:15.150> even

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
advise to UM to make the light look even

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.839 
advise to UM to make the light look even
brighter<00:03:15.810> than<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.259> is<00:03:16.409> because<00:03:16.829> every<00:03:17.609> one<00:03:17.759> of

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
brighter than it is because every one of

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.879 
brighter than it is because every one of
these<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.180> paint<00:03:18.479> ridges<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:19.349> give<00:03:19.769> you

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
these little paint ridges will give you

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.490 
these little paint ridges will give you
a<00:03:19.919> little<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.400> more<00:03:20.669> glare<00:03:21.239> because<00:03:22.139> most

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
a little bit more glare because most

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.369 
a little bit more glare because most
paintings<00:03:23.040> as<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:24.030> all<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.540> our<00:03:24.689> life<00:03:24.900> most

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
paintings as in all of our life most

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.259 
paintings as in all of our life most
things<00:03:25.650> are<00:03:25.859> lit<00:03:26.129> from<00:03:26.159> above<00:03:26.669> because<00:03:26.909> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
things are lit from above because the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.569 
things are lit from above because the
sun's<00:03:27.540> above<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.109> clouds<00:03:28.349> are<00:03:28.620> both<00:03:28.799> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
sun's above the clouds are both and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.369 
sun's above the clouds are both and
normally<00:03:30.299> when<00:03:30.449> you<00:03:30.569> put<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> painting<00:03:31.199> in<00:03:31.349> your

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
normally when you put a painting in your

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.759 
normally when you put a painting in your
house<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.799> put<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:31.979> light<00:03:32.220> above<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.699> so<00:03:33.769> that

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
house you put a light above it so that

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.890 
house you put a light above it so that
is<00:03:35.040> another<00:03:35.459> reason<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:36.389> anyway<00:03:36.659> I<00:03:36.720> just

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
is another reason so anyway I just

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.300 
is another reason so anyway I just
wanted<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:37.229> think<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.189> see

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
wanted you to think about that and see

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.039 
wanted you to think about that and see
how<00:03:38.340> that's<00:03:38.909> quieter<00:03:39.449> here<00:03:39.659> but<00:03:39.870> thicker

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
how that's quieter here but thicker

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.559 
how that's quieter here but thicker
brush<00:03:40.560> strokes<00:03:40.889> here<00:03:41.099> I'm<00:03:41.340> pretty<00:03:41.939> deliberate

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
brush strokes here I'm pretty deliberate

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.689 
brush strokes here I'm pretty deliberate
about<00:03:42.870> my<00:03:43.049> brush<00:03:43.349> strokes<00:03:43.680> when<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.099> paint<00:03:44.549> and

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
about my brush strokes when I paint and

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.349 
about my brush strokes when I paint and
see<00:03:44.909> how<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.540> ear<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.500> receding<00:03:47.099> area<00:03:47.819> so

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
see how this ear it's a receding area so

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.819 
see how this ear it's a receding area so
you<00:03:48.449> notice<00:03:48.659> how<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> soften<00:03:49.319> those<00:03:49.439> brush

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
you notice how I soften those brush

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.649 
you notice how I soften those brush
strokes<00:03:50.189> right<00:03:50.609> there<00:03:50.879> because<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.209> don't<00:03:51.269> want

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
strokes right there because I don't want

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.379 
strokes right there because I don't want
a<00:03:51.930> lot<00:03:52.199> of<00:03:52.470> attention<00:03:53.099> there<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.180> I'm<00:03:54.239> not

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
a lot of attention there and I'm not

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.729 
a lot of attention there and I'm not
saying<00:03:54.629> this<00:03:54.750> painting<00:03:55.169> by<00:03:55.319> any<00:03:55.469> stretch<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
saying this painting by any stretch of
