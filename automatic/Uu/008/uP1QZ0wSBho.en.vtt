00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.980 
astronomer Frederick William Herschel
Herschel<00:01:31.369> knew<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.819> prism<00:01:32.360> could<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.750> used

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
Herschel knew that a prism could be used

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.919 
Herschel knew that a prism could be used
to<00:01:33.229> break<00:01:33.440> white<00:01:33.799> light<00:01:34.100> into<00:01:34.399> colors<00:01:34.940> he

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
to break white light into colors he

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.990 
to break white light into colors he
wanted<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.319> know<00:01:36.500> whether<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.039> colors<00:01:37.490> had

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
wanted to know whether the colors had

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.680 
wanted to know whether the colors had
different<00:01:38.450> temperatures<00:01:39.159> they<00:01:40.159> did<00:01:40.520> but<00:01:41.420> then

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
different temperatures they did but then

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.779 
different temperatures they did but then
Herschel<00:01:42.259> measured<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.709> empty<00:01:43.009> space<00:01:43.310> just

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
Herschel measured the empty space just

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.969 
Herschel measured the empty space just
