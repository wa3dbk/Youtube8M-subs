the goalies stripped of gear off there
you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.310> part<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> everybody<00:00:24.090> wants

about it so i think we tried to stay out
of<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.290> i<00:00:34.760> think<00:00:35.760> they're<00:00:35.880> coming<00:00:36.059> pretty

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

greece<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> trying<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> start<00:00:39.540> stuff<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
greece and trying to start stuff so I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.240 
greece and trying to start stuff so I
thought<00:00:40.290> did<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.040> job<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
thought did a pretty good job of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.910 
thought did a pretty good job of
handling<00:00:41.840> about<00:00:42.840> what's<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.649> through<00:00:43.890> your

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
handling about what's going through your

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.709 
handling about what's going through your
mind<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.700> flurries<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> take

let's go flower do a good job basically
I<00:00:56.010> mean<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.940> Budaj<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.660> tough<00:00:57.899> to

I mean I think Budaj is pretty tough to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.130 
I mean I think Budaj is pretty tough to
you<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.260> he's<00:00:58.559> fought<00:00:58.770> before<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.420> um<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you I think he's fought before so um you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.420 
you I think he's fought before so um you
know<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.620> who<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:01.980> who<00:01:02.399> would

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
know I don't know who would who would

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.789 
know I don't know who would who would
win<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.960> both<00:01:04.199> look<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.650> they're

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
win but I think both look like they're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
win but I think both look like they're
pretty<00:01:05.100> willing<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> point<00:01:08.780> yeah<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> was

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
pretty willing at that point yeah it was

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.789 
pretty willing at that point yeah it was
good<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:11.330> we<00:01:12.330> definitely<00:01:12.750> buckle<00:01:13.650> down

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
good we we definitely buckle down

good we we definitely buckle down
especially<00:01:14.100> defensively<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.030> didn't<00:01:16.020> give

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
especially defensively and didn't give

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.719 
especially defensively and didn't give
him<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.890> did<00:01:17.070> flower<00:01:17.400> made<00:01:17.580> some

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
have to do and we know that I think as

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
have to do and we know that I think as
as<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> leadership<00:02:14.500> group<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.860> mean<00:02:15.010> he<00:02:15.130> was

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
as a leadership group I mean he was

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.220 
as a leadership group I mean he was
someone<00:02:15.580> who<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.790> there<00:02:16.000> before<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.540> I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
someone who was there before and I'm

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.490 
someone who was there before and I'm
sure<00:02:17.530> we'll<00:02:17.769> probably<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.690> know<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:20.019> high

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
sure we'll probably you know on high

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.410 
sure we'll probably you know on high
demand<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:20.980> far<00:02:21.160> as<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.459> know<00:02:21.580> his<00:02:21.880> experience

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
demand as far as you know his experience

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.820 
demand as far as you know his experience
too<00:02:22.599> so<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.840> think<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.230> guys<00:02:23.380> who<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.590> coming

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
too so I think the guys who are coming

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.009 
too so I think the guys who are coming
back<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:25.000> been<00:02:25.150> there<00:02:25.330> before<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.690> think

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
back and have been there before I think

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.420 
back and have been there before I think
we<00:02:26.440> all<00:02:26.560> want<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.799> make<00:02:26.890> sure<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.220> we're<00:02:27.310> lead

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
we all want to make sure that we're lead

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:36.809 
we all want to make sure that we're lead
by<00:02:27.610> example<00:02:31.080> yeah<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.489> haven't<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:36.700> it's

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
by example yeah I haven't I think it's

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.759 
by example yeah I haven't I think it's
mixed<00:02:37.120> emotions<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:37.840> he<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.590> know<00:02:38.709> you

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
mixed emotions I think he you know you

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.350 
mixed emotions I think he you know you
don't<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.130> happen<00:02:39.459> very<00:02:39.489> often<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.150> I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
don't see that happen very often and I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.960 
don't see that happen very often and I
think<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.099> back<00:02:42.250> your<00:02:42.459> mind<00:02:42.610> you're<00:02:42.790> glad

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
think in the back your mind you're glad

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270 
think in the back your mind you're glad
that<00:02:43.209> nobody's<00:02:43.930> nobody's<00:02:44.200> hurt<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.190> know

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
that nobody's nobody's hurt and you know

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.670 
that nobody's nobody's hurt and you know
he<00:02:45.400> didn't<00:02:45.640> take<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> chance<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.680> he

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
he didn't take a chance like that so he

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.020 
he didn't take a chance like that so he
looked<00:02:47.890> pretty<00:02:48.069> willing<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.489> excited<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.910> do

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
looked pretty willing and excited to do

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.819 
looked pretty willing and excited to do
it<00:02:49.180> both<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.569> them<00:02:49.660> did<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.079> that<00:02:50.530> being<00:02:50.739> said

it both of them did but that being said

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it's probably it's probably for the best

yeah<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.650> think<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.460> think<00:03:19.390> we<00:03:19.540> really<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.200> was

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
something we really talked about your

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.610 
something we really talked about your
last<00:03:22.390> couple<00:03:22.660> days<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.930> making<00:03:23.230> sure<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.470> took

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
last couple days is making sure we took

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.830 
last couple days is making sure we took
care<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.830> things<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.220> on<00:03:24.310> end<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.940> think<00:03:25.720> we

care of things are on end and I think we

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.000 
care of things are on end and I think we
trust<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.170> we're<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.440> get<00:03:26.530> offensive

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
trust so we're going to get offensive

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.699 
trust so we're going to get offensive
chances<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.580> we<00:03:27.940> definitely<00:03:28.410> need<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.440> kind

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
chances but we definitely need to kind

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.190 
chances but we definitely need to kind
of<00:03:30.120> put<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.270> little<00:03:31.360> extra<00:03:31.480> time<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:31.990> making
