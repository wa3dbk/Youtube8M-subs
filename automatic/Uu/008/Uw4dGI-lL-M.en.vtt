interesting<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> fact<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.049> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
interesting is the fact that and it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
interesting is the fact that and it's
like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> Auld<00:01:28.950> Lance's<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like this what the Auld Lance's is that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
like this what the Auld Lance's is that
the<00:01:30.119> strong<00:01:30.360> attack<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.960> running<00:01:31.290> attack<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the strong attack the running attack and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.060 
the strong attack the running attack and
the<00:01:32.310> backstep<00:01:33.240> attack<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:34.140> hit<00:01:34.710> multiple

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the backstep attack all hit multiple

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
the backstep attack all hit multiple
times<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:36.420> shows<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> hits<00:01:37.229> once

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
times this shows you that it hits once

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.200 
times this shows you that it hits once
and<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.460> shows<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> connects

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and this actually shows that it connects

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
and this actually shows that it connects
multiple<00:01:39.570> times<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.860> said<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
multiple times now like I said that's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.350 
multiple times now like I said that's
something<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> bring<00:01:41.939> along<00:01:42.180> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069

used<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.070> slow<00:03:07.370> hitting<00:03:07.700> weapons<00:03:08.030> then

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
used to the slow hitting weapons then

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.390 
used to the slow hitting weapons then
this<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.200> definitely<00:03:09.320> something<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.100> might

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
this is definitely something you might

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.150 
this is definitely something you might
want<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.700> check<00:03:10.880> out<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.329> pro<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.650> con<00:03:12.680> -<00:03:13.010> this

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
want to check out a pro and a con - this

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.099 
want to check out a pro and a con - this
weapon<00:03:13.489> though<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.480> fact<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.840> it's

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
weapon though is the fact that it's

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.050 
weapon though is the fact that it's
backstep<00:03:15.709> it's<00:03:15.950> running<00:03:16.280> attack<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.880> it's

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
backstep it's running attack and it's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180 
backstep it's running attack and it's
strong<00:03:17.329> attack<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:18.140> actually<00:03:18.500> chain<00:03:18.799> up<00:03:19.070> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
strong attack can actually chain up and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.300 
strong attack can actually chain up and
hit<00:03:19.880> your<00:03:20.060> enemy<00:03:20.450> multiple<00:03:20.930> times<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
hit your enemy multiple times the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.759 
hit your enemy multiple times the
contour<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.790> though<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.390> if<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.320> miss<00:03:24.560> it

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
contour that though is if you miss it

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.009 
contour that though is if you miss it
then<00:03:25.370> you're<00:03:25.670> pretty<00:03:25.850> much<00:03:25.970> opening<00:03:26.600> yourself

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
then you're pretty much opening yourself

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.620 
then you're pretty much opening yourself
to<00:03:27.200> being<00:03:27.380> punished<00:03:27.829> pretty<00:03:28.310> bad<00:03:28.519> there<00:03:29.480> were

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
to being punished pretty bad there were

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.660 
to being punished pretty bad there were
a<00:03:29.660> couple<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.170> times<00:03:30.410> where<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:30.829> try<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> go<00:03:31.459> for

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
a couple of times where I try to go for

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.020 
a couple of times where I try to go for
those<00:03:31.790> moves<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:33.109> enemy<00:03:33.410> predicted<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.280> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
those moves the enemy predicted it and I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.000 
those moves the enemy predicted it and I
pretty<00:03:35.299> much<00:03:35.390> lost<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> fight<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.530> that's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
pretty much lost the fight so that's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.890 
pretty much lost the fight so that's
kind<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.310> something<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.670> take<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:38.690> into

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
kind of something to take a take into

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.590 
kind of something to take a take into
consideration<00:03:39.560> these<00:03:40.430> are<00:03:40.640> more<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:41.090> picking

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
consideration these are more of picking

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.890 
consideration these are more of picking
shoes<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.260> situational<00:03:42.980> type<00:03:43.220> moves<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.180> it's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
shoes and situational type moves so it's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.390 
shoes and situational type moves so it's
definitely<00:03:45.380> not<00:03:45.590> something<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.130> want<00:03:46.340> to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
definitely not something you want to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.670 
definitely not something you want to
spam<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.660> thing<00:03:47.840> though<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.290> if<00:03:48.590> you

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
spam the one thing though is that if you

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.349 
spam the one thing though is that if you
do<00:03:48.799> connect<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.220> hit<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.640> actually<00:03:50.180> lays

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
do connect that hit it actually lays

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.479 
do connect that hit it actually lays
them<00:03:50.540> out<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.680> can<00:03:51.859> pretty<00:03:51.980> much<00:03:52.070> take<00:03:52.430> a

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
them out so you can pretty much take a

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.490 
them out so you can pretty much take a
step<00:03:52.730> back<00:03:52.940> regain<00:03:53.750> some<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.109> stamina

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
step back regain some of the stamina

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.710 
step back regain some of the stamina
because<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:55.010> does<00:03:55.220> use<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.579> lot<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> stamina<00:03:56.329> if

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
because it does use a lot of stamina if

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.840 
because it does use a lot of stamina if
you're<00:03:56.930> gonna<00:03:57.079> use<00:03:57.260> those<00:03:57.440> moves<00:03:57.709> regain<00:03:58.609> some

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
you're gonna use those moves regain some

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.970 
you're gonna use those moves regain some
of<00:03:58.880> your<00:03:59.030> stamina<00:03:59.269> and<00:03:59.630> pretty<00:04:00.109> much<00:04:00.260> get

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
of your stamina and pretty much get

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.230 
of your stamina and pretty much get
ready<00:04:01.220> when<00:04:01.640> he<00:04:01.760> gets<00:04:01.970> up

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
ready when he gets up

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.640 
ready when he gets up
in<00:04:03.300> one<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.110> fights<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.380> you're<00:04:04.560> gonna

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
in one of the fights that you're gonna

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.170 
in one of the fights that you're gonna
see<00:04:04.890> actually<00:04:05.960> you're<00:04:06.960> gonna<00:04:07.050> see<00:04:07.350> me<00:04:07.590> being

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
see actually you're gonna see me being

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.610 
see actually you're gonna see me being
predicted<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.330> go<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.020> running<00:04:10.320> attack

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
predicted I go in for the running attack

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.160 
predicted I go in for the running attack
he<00:04:11.130> was<00:04:11.250> able<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.520> dodge<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.030> get<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.930> couple

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
he was able to dodge it get in a couple

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.050 
he was able to dodge it get in a couple
of<00:04:13.260> hits<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.710> little<00:04:14.310> bit<00:04:14.430> later<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
of hits a little bit later on in the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.430 
of hits a little bit later on in the
fight<00:04:15.240> though<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> use<00:04:15.690> them<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.200> my<00:04:16.320> advantage

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
fight though I use them to my advantage

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.130 
fight though I use them to my advantage
where<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.310> try<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.700> fake<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.330> try<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.660> go<00:04:18.840> for

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
where I try to fake it I try to go for

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.100 
where I try to fake it I try to go for
the<00:04:19.170> run<00:04:19.770> attack<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:20.850> at<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.450> end<00:04:21.480> of<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.930> I

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
the run attack but at the end of it I

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.140 
the run attack but at the end of it I
actually<00:04:22.290> looked<00:04:22.980> back<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.760> left<00:04:23.940> stick

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
actually looked back on the left stick

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.990 
actually looked back on the left stick
and<00:04:24.650> walked<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.070> by<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.490> time<00:04:26.520> he<00:04:26.880> was

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and walked up and by that time he was

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.370 
and walked up and by that time he was
already<00:04:27.060> dodging<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.780> because<00:04:28.110> he<00:04:28.290> was

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
already dodging it because he was

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.510 
already dodging it because he was
predicting<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:28.980> was<00:04:29.130> gonna<00:04:29.220> do<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
predicting that I was gonna do the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.420 
predicting that I was gonna do the
running<00:04:29.790> motion<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:31.020> pretty<00:04:31.830> much<00:04:31.920> walked<00:04:32.160> up

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
running motion I pretty much walked up

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.670 
running motion I pretty much walked up
on<00:04:32.580> him<00:04:32.610> mid<00:04:33.150> dodge<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.750> was<00:04:34.170> able<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.440> do<00:04:34.650> a

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
on him mid dodge and was able to do a

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.250 
on him mid dodge and was able to do a
couple<00:04:34.950> of<00:04:35.160> hits<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.520> think<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.150> won<00:04:36.510> when<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:36.960> did

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
couple of hits I think I won when I did

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.900 
couple of hits I think I won when I did
that<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:37.680> I'm<00:04:37.890> not<00:04:38.010> too<00:04:38.190> sure<00:04:38.220> because<00:04:38.730> it's

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
that but I'm not too sure because it's

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.760 
that but I'm not too sure because it's
been<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> while<00:04:39.420> since<00:04:39.900> I've<00:04:40.200> actually<00:04:40.230> took

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
been a while since I've actually took

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.340 
been a while since I've actually took
this<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.010> PvP<00:04:41.540> one<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.750> techniques<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.230> I

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
this to PvP one of the techniques that I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.470 
this to PvP one of the techniques that I
