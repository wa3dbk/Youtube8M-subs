and I thought with the ipad would be
even<00:01:53.140> better<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.650> but<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.490> turns<00:01:54.820> out

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
even better for that but it turns out

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.810 
even better for that but it turns out
