00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 And then you talk to me . 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.289
 back here with step wolves in japan 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.689
 the suzuka team we started here with 30 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.840
 bring as much speed as possible 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 that on this line went to parties and that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.300
 keeps the seventh gear closing of the rs 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 the closer to the craziest curve 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.600
 make putting rs open between bringing the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 frustration in the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.850
 our most boring and technical part of the 53 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.320
 what a camacho that does not pass in a march 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 brings the third to have a little 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 motor brake keeps the fourth all this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 session and complicated curves 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 for you to have a little more inflation 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 without running out of the engine 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.359
 here you try to stained the car more 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.280
 possible into the line and the curve 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.719
 places the fifth gear that has this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.129
 quick turn that had a little foot 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.049
 care about these reminds you that the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.760
 left that she learned occurs 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.740
 Hurt you in the cold 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.430
 here you will have a curve that a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.350
 here in second gear that is has 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 to do as much as possible on the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 within the curve always much 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.330
 attraction that comes with another exception 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.310
 of curves here is a straight curve here 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.680
 open as much as possible leading to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.869
 for the 3rd march that has ever put 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.299
 Get your foot off the accelerator here. 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.799
 always keep the car always bigger 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.009
 attraction is possible that now comes the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 of the 130r here places the nun's balance 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.659
 forward 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.350
 already a strong event of the event follows 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.710
 so after the 230 r here already arrives at 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 320 birth to 30 r reduces to second 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 on here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.509
 care with the traction here keeps the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 second gear uses a little zebra 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.000
 here on the inside here just the law 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.940
 break the rs here we have a loop 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.350
 in a link here 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.770
 at 30 and 21 30 I want 36 are dangerous or 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:18.950
 the profit I am crazy high of low 36 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.560
 here is the back bean a quick turn but 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 You can download more if I make one. 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.860
 little one doing only r think never in the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.050
 I think I should ask for a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.140
 tenth of the 10 in the students what in him that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:38.360
 I think it 's too early but the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.860
 important here is that setap is here 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.320
 I'll show you here it has 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.810
 some peculiarities here in this step 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.660
 It's to start here. We have one more at 42 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.120
 had the high-speed curves that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.770
 Here we prefer to put a little more 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.690
 angle of the rear wing is john 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.410
 enough can put 5 2 in the race 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.210
 it was 47 small high we have many curves 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.040
 high speed so I want 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.680
 let him come out and bring me to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.670
 as accurate as possible. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.480
 balance 6 10 6 10 because we have here 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.040
 several various traction sessions here 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.020
 very important then reduce slightly 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 balance in the rear for me to have 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.670
 more force at the time of the turn 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.870
 here we have a different suspension here 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.080
 316 10 is preferred to put three because 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.880
 the higher I put the suspension 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.230
 in the front it will be different 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.390
 I do not want him in front skirt does not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.840
 You do not want to too. 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.360
 They try to reduce some of the time 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.890
 Then I put 6 because to have 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.530
 more force in the lead than the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 agility and especially because of the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.209
 front exit that has circuit here 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.220
 Basque since there are very large swings 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.950
 this one paying in the trio team at 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.040
 rating but if it is in the race you 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.880
 It makes these adjustments where we bring one 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.670
 little more than tensile strength and wear 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.400
 slightly smaller tire 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.819
 so this is it there more videos, step and go 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.710
 I do not know what I'm going to do now. 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.760
 receive suggestions here for this track here 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.940
 I told you there 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.940
 It is to have a good day and thanks for some there
