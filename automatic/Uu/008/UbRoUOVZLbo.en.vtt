I've had to learn to adapt to you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
I've had to learn to adapt to you
because<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.960> weren't<00:00:55.530> athletes<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.190> some

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
because they weren't athletes at some

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420 
because they weren't athletes at some
point<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.660> someone<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.430> like

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
point or is you know someone like a like

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
point or is you know someone like a like
Brian<00:00:59.789> minor<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.359> grant<00:01:00.629> by<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> face<00:01:01.050> mask

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
Brian minor I can grant by the face mask

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
Brian minor I can grant by the face mask
and<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.710> Sonya<00:01:02.340> messin<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.690> right

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and be like Sonya messin up right right

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and be like Sonya messin up right right
and<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:04.860> okay<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.950> puts<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in a better place mentally because you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.210 
in a better place mentally because you
know<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> commit<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.010> something

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
know you know how to commit to something

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
know you know how to commit to something
you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.790> definitely<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.840> kind

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you know there was definitely some kind

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.520 
you know there was definitely some kind
of<00:01:13.590> grind<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.670> being<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.150> gymnast<00:01:15.810> even<00:01:16.080> when

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of grind to being a gymnast even when

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.999 
of grind to being a gymnast even when
you<00:01:16.619> were<00:01:16.770> younger<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.770> there's<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you were younger so there's that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
you were younger so there's that
advantage<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.689> we

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
advantage but I think as to how we

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
advantage but I think as to how we
respond<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> weight<00:01:22.560> training<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
respond to weight training that's just

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.420 
respond to weight training that's just
you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.840> very

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
you know that's going to be very

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.679 
you know that's going to be very
dependent<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.460> person<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> person<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
dependent on person to person and I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.819 
dependent on person to person and I
recall<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.229> first<00:01:28.439> started<00:01:28.680> weight

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
recall when i first started weight

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
recall when i first started weight
training<00:01:28.860> mean<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> few<00:01:30.150> buddies<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.750> took

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
training mean a few buddies we all took

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
training mean a few buddies we all took
it<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> same<00:01:31.680> time<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.180> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it up at the same time and you know it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
it up at the same time and you know it's
funny<00:01:33.509> cuz<00:01:33.840> i'm<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> only<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.880> stayed

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
funny cuz i'm the only one that stayed

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
funny cuz i'm the only one that stayed
yeah<00:01:36.689> i<00:01:36.900> stayed<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.229> track<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> i<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.890> cuz<00:01:38.040> i

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
yeah i stayed on track and i think cuz i

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
yeah i stayed on track and i think cuz i
got<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.640> positive<00:01:38.880> reinforcement<00:01:39.780> from

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
got so much positive reinforcement from

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
got so much positive reinforcement from
it<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.619> actually<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.150> one

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it I'm actually the what was only one

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.609 
it I'm actually the what was only one
that<00:01:42.540> made<00:01:42.720> any<00:01:43.040> significant<00:01:44.040> gains<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.520> 16<00:01:45.619> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that made any significant gains at 16 so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
that made any significant gains at 16 so
I<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.000> even<00:01:48.180> more

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
I do think that and you know even more

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929

if i can get a pound right that would be

awesome things like wooden already and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.490 
awesome things like wooden already and
it's<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:51.920> much<00:02:52.070> harder<00:02:52.100> for<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.580> girl<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500

offseason I think that's going to depend
on<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:27.080> few<00:03:28.070> things<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.610> come<00:03:28.790> down<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
on a few things that come down to the

and<00:03:43.409> where<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:44.519> some<00:03:44.760> people<00:03:45.239> who<00:03:45.360> can

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and where is there some people who can

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.059 
and where is there some people who can
touch<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.079> electric<00:03:46.409> fence<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.860> they'll

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
touch the electric fence and they'll

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.979 
touch the electric fence and they'll
touch<00:03:47.219> it<00:03:47.400> again<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.030> doesn't<00:03:48.689> faze<00:03:48.959> me

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
touch it again it just doesn't faze me

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.630 
touch it again it just doesn't faze me
you<00:03:49.319> know<00:03:49.439> great<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:50.250> there's<00:03:50.489> other

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
you know great and then there's other

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.069 
you know great and then there's other
people<00:03:51.000> who<00:03:51.090> touch<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.569> fence<00:03:51.719> and<00:03:51.989> they're

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
people who touch that fence and they're

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.750 
people who touch that fence and they're
just<00:03:52.319> in<00:03:52.469> shell<00:03:52.769> shock<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.310> they're<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.640> I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
just in shell shock and they're like I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.509 
just in shell shock and they're like I
can't<00:03:54.390> do<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.719> again<00:03:55.079> for<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.560> year<00:03:56.340> at<00:03:56.489> least

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
can't do that again for a year at least

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.990 
can't do that again for a year at least
yeah<00:03:56.939> and<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:58.739> course<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.189> depends<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.519> what

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
yeah and of course it depends on what

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.199 
yeah and of course it depends on what
approach<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.480> took<00:04:00.689> but<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.129> honest<00:04:02.459> with

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
approach you took but to be honest with

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.479 
approach you took but to be honest with
some<00:04:03.510> people<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.079> going<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.409> be<00:04:04.489> so

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
some people it's just going to be so

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.690 
some people it's just going to be so
he's<00:04:05.640> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.849> be<00:04:06.629> moderately<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.670> be<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
he's going to be moderately to be a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.789 
he's going to be moderately to be a
little<00:04:08.819> bit<00:04:08.970> more<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> rough<00:04:10.290> path<00:04:10.530> you

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
little bit more to be a rough path you

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.559 
little bit more to be a rough path you
know<00:04:10.889> for<00:04:11.280> example<00:04:11.340> Helms<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.269> good<00:04:12.480> example

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
know for example Helms is a good example

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.289 
know for example Helms is a good example
that<00:04:12.930> regardless<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.769> how<00:04:14.400> we've<00:04:15.060> gotten

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
that regardless of how we've gotten

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.729 
that regardless of how we've gotten
better<00:04:15.420> at<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.199> him<00:04:16.380> it's<00:04:16.530> still<00:04:16.709> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
better at it but for him it's still a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.529 
better at it but for him it's still a
little<00:04:16.859> rougher<00:04:17.250> than<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.789> example<00:04:17.820> Bridal

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
little rougher than for example Bridal

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.449 
little rougher than for example Bridal
illness<00:04:18.810> was<00:04:19.019> another<00:04:19.229> guy<00:04:19.440> who<00:04:19.500> who<00:04:20.250> gets

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
illness was another guy who who gets

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.620 
illness was another guy who who gets
blamed<00:04:21.410> relatively<00:04:22.410> easily<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.849> he's<00:04:24.509> able

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
blamed relatively easily and he's able

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.839 
blamed relatively easily and he's able
to<00:04:24.780> maintain<00:04:25.139> 10<00:04:25.860> pounds<00:04:26.160> over<00:04:26.250> contest<00:04:26.699> wait

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
to maintain 10 pounds over contest wait

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.070 
to maintain 10 pounds over contest wait
it's<00:04:27.150> nothing<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:29.220> yeah<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.330> depends<00:04:30.660> on<00:04:30.810> where

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it's nothing so yeah it depends on where

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.719 
it's nothing so yeah it depends on where
you<00:04:31.199> are<00:04:31.320> where<00:04:31.710> are<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.009> mentally<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.699> know

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
you are where are you mentally you know

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.460 
you are where are you mentally you know
just<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.120> week<00:04:33.389> or<00:04:33.509> two<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.780> because<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.169> want

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
just a week or two that because I want

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.210 
just a week or two that because I want
why<00:04:34.800> don't<00:04:35.009> get<00:04:35.419> naturally<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.949> don't<00:04:37.949> know<00:04:38.130> if

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
why don't get naturally I don't know if

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.689 
why don't get naturally I don't know if
I<00:04:38.310> could<00:04:38.580> get<00:04:38.910> much<00:04:39.120> bigger<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:41.430> probably

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
I could get much bigger you probably

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.749 
I could get much bigger you probably
can't<00:04:41.910> go<00:04:42.060> down<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.570> much<00:04:43.289> bigger<00:04:43.560> bigger<00:04:44.490> on

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
can't go down that much bigger bigger on

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.339 
can't go down that much bigger bigger on
stage<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:45.539> know<00:04:45.599> I'm<00:04:45.900> only<00:04:45.990> gonna<00:04:46.199> get

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
stage like I know I'm only gonna get

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.680 
stage like I know I'm only gonna get
smaller<00:04:46.620> from<00:04:46.830> here<00:04:46.979> well<00:04:47.160> however<00:04:47.970> if<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.630> took

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
smaller from here well however if I took

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.580 
smaller from here well however if I took
two<00:04:49.260> years<00:04:49.289> of<00:04:49.919> really<00:04:50.490> trying<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.300> make<00:04:52.260> lean

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
two years of really trying to make lean

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.300 
two years of really trying to make lean
gains<00:04:52.889> would<00:04:53.849> I<00:04:53.880> even<00:04:54.180> at<00:04:55.050> my<00:04:55.260> age<00:04:55.289> but<00:04:56.099> it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
gains would I even at my age but it

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.240 
gains would I even at my age but it
would<00:04:56.729> not<00:04:56.849> show<00:04:57.180> up<00:04:57.210> on<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.630> scale<00:04:58.250> it's

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
would not show up on the scale it's

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.879 
would not show up on the scale it's
right<00:04:59.729> it's<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.599> almost<00:05:01.050> like<00:05:01.349> when<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.680> go

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
right it's it's almost like when I go

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.420 
right it's it's almost like when I go
back<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.370> see<00:05:02.659> pictures<00:05:03.659> of<00:05:04.430> bodybuilders

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
back and I see pictures of bodybuilders

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.560 
back and I see pictures of bodybuilders
have<00:05:05.550> been<00:05:05.639> doing<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:05.909> forever<00:05:06.060> their<00:05:06.360> stage

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
have been doing it forever their stage

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.570 
have been doing it forever their stage
weights<00:05:06.900> well<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.380> took<00:05:07.500> me<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> same<00:05:07.949> right

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
weights well it took me the same right

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.270 
weights well it took me the same right
but<00:05:09.030> they<00:05:09.539> look<00:05:09.810> totally<00:05:10.320> different<00:05:10.680> it's

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
but they look totally different it's

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.469 
but they look totally different it's
almost<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.729> point<00:05:11.820> where<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.270> looks<00:05:12.389> like

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
almost to the point where it looks like

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.360 
almost to the point where it looks like
muscle<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.650> know<00:05:13.740> they<00:05:13.860> say<00:05:13.889> you<00:05:14.039> can't

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
muscle you know they say you can't

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.580 
muscle you know they say you can't
change<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.060> shape<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.449> muscle<00:05:15.659> it<00:05:16.260> almost

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
change the shape of a muscle it almost

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.550 
change the shape of a muscle it almost
looks<00:05:17.010> like<00:05:17.099> muscle<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:18.240> could<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.409> almost

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
looks like muscle is I could it almost

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.020 
looks like muscle is I could it almost
looks<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:19.889> it's<00:05:20.099> changing<00:05:20.520> shape<00:05:20.760> and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
looks like it's changing shape and

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.360 
looks like it's changing shape and
things<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.930> look<00:05:22.199> that<00:05:22.440> much<00:05:22.680> more<00:05:22.979> more

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
things just look that much more more

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.719 
things just look that much more more
dense<00:05:23.960> separations<00:05:24.960> way<00:05:25.199> better<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.280> there's

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
dense separations way better so there's

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.770 
dense separations way better so there's
a<00:05:26.789> lot<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.060> things<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.630> you<00:05:27.780> cannot<00:05:28.280> quantify

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
a lot of things that you cannot quantify

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.029 
a lot of things that you cannot quantify
that<00:05:30.780> will<00:05:30.990> take<00:05:31.199> place<00:05:31.229> with<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> good

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
that will take place with a good

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.430 
that will take place with a good
offseason<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.720> gain<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> pound<00:05:34.169> or<00:05:34.380> two

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
offseason so if you gain a pound or two

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.290 
offseason so if you gain a pound or two
on<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.800> scale<00:05:35.070> or<00:05:35.340> what<00:05:35.699> do<00:05:35.849> for<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.060> can<00:05:36.180> do

on the scale or what do for you can do

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.480

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
but if you don't you probably still made

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.080
