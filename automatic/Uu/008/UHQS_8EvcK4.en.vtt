 melchior so i radiation for it 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 general operation 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 both internally and externally and not only 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 from klaas scripting but also from 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 direction 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 study with your head why they 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 once in a while 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 sinti and manganese who his father is very 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 are small is really only started 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 stretched and I now will the century 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.880
 say to the message 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.010
 and i think i'm quite myself 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.450
 mcs character so now we actually come 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.680
 into the space of the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.110
 order managers 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.360
 where he is all files from a to z 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.650
 be prepared to be followed 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 And then we actually are up 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.060
 We plan those kinds of all operation 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.540
 down as the following on our differences 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.540
 machines 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.790
 here we went to the desk my father 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.150
 sitting at his desk here is mine 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.580
 father 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.780
 the founder of the whole 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.780
 company 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.510
 then they stepped it around 78 with one 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.550
 You own your own business at the printing office 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.860
 Gido when Klaas is a piece together 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.229
 that has grown until we have 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.660
 have to move to the location here now 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.720
 were we had a double surface 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.830
 since 2000 and 6 are the first two 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.770
 soaked daughters in the bag and in 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.869
 2009 is during the cream when we come 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.460
 life to the beepers continue so from the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.380
 prepress that after the actually the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.030
 send files within the client 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.740
 and here tomorrow then the files busy 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.090
 prepared to end up at the press 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.100
 to be able to get 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.009
 koenie she found work for the content of 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.899
 a number of specific customers both from 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.300
 brochures and your website a 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.000
 such more quietly 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.710
 more and more have the printing needs 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.680
 Multimedia is becoming one 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.410
 everything comes together the people 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.970
 are also more common and brochures 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.900
 can view people who are going something 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.280
 Search 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.280
 yes that can also be searched on the internet 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.170
 salamiya then come to us 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.230
 a whole g5 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.890
 a large space where the core is the heart 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.260
 from our company 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.420
 You actually start the 8 color press 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.860
 they might be a bit shorter 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.930
 go see that is a bit of a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.910
 our group's showpiece here 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.400
 we print directly on both sides of 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.680
 the paper but of course a huge bee 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 the advantage at 90 angles as fast 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.610
 which you of course go to 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.069
 the customers can better prices 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.959
 and which also makes you competitive 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.640
 note the market was an evolution that 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.230
 very fast hearing loss 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.269
 her car suddenly became a busier competitor 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.549
 because if you don't put up with it 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.209
 last of materials is available 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.410
 then simply competing out of the maxi 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.630
 not expecting that they went 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.730
 to take over 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.500
 sure if not then leah thys was for sure 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 a surprise the first question was of 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.190
 is the printing world or is it 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.870
 graphic sector by extension one 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.120
 sector where time wants to commit me 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.130
 where I enter my group and have it there 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.760
 I decide very quickly yes, I think 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.060
 quite a challenge here my generation 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.180
 transfer it is very important that 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.030
 all parties are open to each other because 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.500
 too often I hear the older ones 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.299
 generation say we have to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.840
 to leave it to the children 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.600
 leave 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.690
 until that time comes and then 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.060
 you notice that the generation is struggling 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.470
 has to let me go with that is good 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.510
 must say I had n't gone either 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.420
 expected in the successful but then one side 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.579
 I am glad your talia is I branch 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.079
 can work with less stress and 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.450
 that's the ultimate responsibility 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.099
 I do not notice that I can transfer 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.780
 to say well to you that problem too 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.690
 third problem with the customer or the country 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.010
 in which paid or also winning what does 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.010
 it's for any new ship 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.230
 Annex a small business where the 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.600
 family capital actually always 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.400
 has been used to new ones 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.430
 investments to make money earns 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.739
 and then put that money back into your company 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.810
 while the big companies of course 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.250
 must appeal to banks in order to 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.690
 to make investments 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.460
 yes we are on the good contacts with you 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.940
 offices of 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.190
 so they are St Peter's deliveries to the 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.730
 found good people very passionate then 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.370
 excavated and so on and that you are taken in 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.510
 The council then asked them to compete for it 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.710
 guide and how are to full 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.710
 satisfaction under put done 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.470
 we are going to have built over 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.689
 now we want to continue and start work 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.889
 In many cases, a second generation is the 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.770
 generation 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.039
 company really can folio large pieces 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.960
 through the generations then usually 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.879
 the decline, but he still says 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.300
 and that I do not know what we are now for 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.919
 and we stand and in recent years horse now 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.110
 here exactly a further hour comes to corner 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.180
 and we hope to 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.680
 to continue to do that 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.539
 voila i hope you are a better one 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.610
 have gained insight into the graphic 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.560
 production process and in our printing company 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.560
 more specifically until the next time
