00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.960
 hello and welcome to spar and case 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.760
 in this video we are going to 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.830
 show how to test the resistance of 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.409
 your washing machine for reasons 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.939
 security do not forget before 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.759
 intervention to unplug your 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.470
 appliance electrically you need 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.599
 a measuring device and a 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.749
 screwdriver to perform the control of 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.429
 the washing machine resistance remove the 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:34.020
 side panel of the washing machine 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.020
 to access the resistance 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.280
 set your meter to the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 position man m 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
 measure between the terminals of 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 resistance 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.790
 the value must also be between 20 and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.790
 30 men 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.680
 you do not have measuring devices 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.140
 test the resistance with a cord 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.549
 power supply by connecting it live 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.740
 on a socket with earth 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.310
 connect the earth to the earth for this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.950
 surgery 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.350
 fill the drum with water and check 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 if the water to heat unplug your 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.679
 electrical appliance mans then fill 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.679
 the drum with water 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.190
 remove the connectors from the resistor 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 then 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.460
 plug in the power cord 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.710
 pay attention to the colors of the wires 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.140
 connect the live cable to a 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.140
 socket with earth 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.950
 if the electrical installation is implemented 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.890
 defect or if the resistance does not heat 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.170
 not this one is defective disconnect 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.540
 the cord and check the temperature of 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.700
 the water test of the resistance probe 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.050
 the probe can also be tested with water m 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.480
 between each of these terminals 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.440
 this value must vary according to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.330
 the temperature 0 men indicates a 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 probe in short circuit so it's 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.450
 defective a value to infinity 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:38.800
 indicates one are broken defective 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.800
 also tested the probe to man m 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.900
 between each of these bounds the value 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.360
 expected is a measure of several 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.690
 dozens of men's pounds according to the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.990
 designs here the probe is in good condition 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.990
 walking 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.610
 the resistance of your washing machine and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
 may be defective if there is one 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.710
 startup problem also the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.620
 disjunctive washing machine there is a problem 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.930
 of temperature of the machine there is a 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.120
 washing quality problem there is a 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.380
 persistent odor despite maintenance 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.800
 regular of the device see you soon on this
