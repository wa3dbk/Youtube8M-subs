00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.570
 hello everyone how are chabán 07 and 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.619
 good in this video I'm going to teach 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:26.950
 how to install the band and cani program 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.950
 Fraps program to seize the games 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.850
 well first let's go with the bank 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.550
 then the links to download the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.240
 programs I'm going to leave the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.120
 video description 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.239
 the quality lights up 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.660
 it's simple it takes a little while where the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.650
 price 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.870
 well here does not run in the bar or with the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.510
 nominal forward then someone 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.690
 introductions 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 and the content we go to the step of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 content 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 what we do is copy 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.870
 and we stick it 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.810
 where without giving him the game 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.250
 in this case I have 64 bits and it's going to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.400
 appear in x86 program files 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.310
 They are fanning lead somewhere else if you are going 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.980
 to seem repetitive program 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.850
 the bandit and watch them beat the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.409
 this is going to come out because he says employ 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.130
 Place copies 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.710
 another runs copy examples good 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 find out the step 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.590
 here what you have to know if 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.960
 they have 32-bit Windows 64 windows 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.750
 for that is simple bad start team and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.909
 click with the right button on 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.570
 properties and this type of system is 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.600
 operating 64 children in my case some 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.920
 appears 32 if you want to know with windows 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.080
 xp go home is displayed on my pc click 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 with the right button itself back and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 says if he has 64 32 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 in case you have 64 as I have you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.580
 that double click on x64 puts that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.960
 if you accept if you are on the site 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.740
 bit 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.330
 click on this 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.490
 let's step 4 double click to file 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.500
 install not run as half or 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.450
 production does not work so we give it 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.780
 a double click this 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.600
 good 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.960
 that would be all because step 5 is not what 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 I almost never do it and it does not work, it does not bother me 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.620
 we open the fan program 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 if we do not go near him 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.780
 and if you have this kind of data, it 's because 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.879
 you're cracked and he's not going to tell you 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.110
 this is a version of one thing by the 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.870
 style 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.620
 Well now I'm going to show you how 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.050
 configure this program 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.750
 only has f8 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.000
 I put this here where they want 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 the numbers of the tracks appear 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.680
 second 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.969
 this as you set it to record 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.950
 he configured it with efe 9 and this that 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:32.900
 there, the most important thing, what I do is 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.780
 three sets youtube 720 p and one 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.470
 modification to that configuration and what 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.790
 I put original size 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.299
 I leave it at 30 fps 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.790
 and I put 100 to have the best 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.819
 quality 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.969
 and well this would be all for 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.159
 Bogota this is all area like this 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.680
 way in which I have configured the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.930
 band and here to which he recorded all the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.109
 idea 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.109
 well I'm going to make this one and go 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.430
 the easy frappier just open it 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.500
 car is already registered this not that 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.780
 believe that there is no case or nothing the only 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.780
 that do a click here 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.720
 and ready you have the frap this is coming 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.849
 Cracked does not need to clark 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.110
 crack or anything so and can record 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.810
 all the minutes you want 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.030
 the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.810
 the secret in this sentence given that a 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.480
 much they told me that gives the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.570
 I have a friend in the clan that with band and 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.220
 that they can not record since van dyck 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.500
 an is heavier than tracks 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.060
 if you have good pc foresee with van 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.790
 dyck to the great advantage that has van 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.120
 dyck at birth that fraps the size of 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.270
 videos if a contrast video weighs 10 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.940
 gigas with band and here it starts at 3 or 4 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.330
 I use van licán because it has the almost 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.389
 Exactly the same quality as apps 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.430
 and much better for me because they weigh less 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:17.100
 the days so 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.340
 that's why I use more indicate that 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.220
 back but they indicate it is much heavier 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.660
 If you do not have a machine, it's not going to do 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.380
 if you have a computer more or 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.650
 less use fraps 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.110
 and the secret of so that it does not give so much 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:39.870
 the great difficulty 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:43.110
 and here they put 120 fps and here they take the 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.600
 full and put it in jal 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.610
 and good here if they want to activate or 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.580
 deactivate the microphone you so that 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.130
 the microphone was recorded no and that would be 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.890
 everything more than that is nothing if they have it 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.310
 this configuration on several machines 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.330
 that are not 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.280
 too powerful it will good to 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.900
 be able to record your video and stuff like that 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.430
 that the one that 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.700
 so 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.870
 well that would be all 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.450
 If you have any questions ask me 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.450
 why suffered things in winning 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.510
 I like my page and the page 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:31.180
 of the clan that two are several 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.360
 and well I hope that 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.400
 that works and anything comment 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.930
 in the videos and the Sirionos and if they have 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.780
 some doubt 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.600
 I believe that 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.260
 soon I will make a video of 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.590
 how to learn did the video on in the 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:53.350
 sony vegas for everyone to see so 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.920
 anything wait a little while 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.250
 I want to finish the video is good until 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.090
 then 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.090
 greetings to all
