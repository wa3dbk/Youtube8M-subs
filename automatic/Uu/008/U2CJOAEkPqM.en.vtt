the chord so for instance let's listen
to<00:01:56.950> our<00:01:56.979> D<00:01:57.189> minor<00:01:57.340> seven<00:01:57.789> again<00:01:58.829> our<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:01.090> North

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
to our D minor seven again our for North

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.630 
to our D minor seven again our for North
the<00:02:01.539> four<00:02:01.780> notes<00:02:02.079> in<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> chord<00:02:02.530> our<00:02:02.829> D<00:02:05.640> now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the four notes in the chord our D now

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.910 
the four notes in the chord our D now
the<00:02:06.700> D<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.989> lot<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.229> ways<00:02:08.530> are

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
the D in the a and a lot of ways are

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.120 
the D in the a and a lot of ways are
expendable<00:02:10.290> especially<00:02:11.290> as<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> guitarist<00:02:11.799> as

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
expendable especially as a guitarist as

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.000 
expendable especially as a guitarist as
a<00:02:12.160> guitarist<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.170> old<00:02:14.290> saying<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.799> jazz

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
a guitarist this the old saying in jazz

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.559 
a guitarist this the old saying in jazz
never<00:02:15.370> worry<00:02:15.579> about<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.880> root<00:02:16.090> because<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
never worry about the root because the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.630 
never worry about the root because the
bassist<00:02:16.959> has<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.220> play<00:02:18.519> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
bassist has it so you just play the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.309 
bassist has it so you just play the
parts<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> chord<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.329> you<00:02:19.450> want<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
parts of the chord that you want and the

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.830 
parts of the chord that you want and the
bassist<00:02:20.709> will<00:02:20.829> get<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.069> D<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> fifth<00:02:22.630> is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
bassist will get the D and the fifth is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.930 
bassist will get the D and the fifth is
always<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.470> most<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.220> most<00:02:24.579> expendable

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
always the most the the most expendable

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.580 
always the most the the most expendable
part<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> chord<00:02:25.810> unless<00:02:26.230> we're<00:02:26.470> playing

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
part of the chord unless we're playing

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.770 
part of the chord unless we're playing
something<00:02:27.040> where<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> fifth<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.700> altered<00:02:28.120> so

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
something where the fifth is altered so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.240 
something where the fifth is altered so
for<00:02:29.019> instance<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:29.440> we're<00:02:29.560> playing<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.860> two<00:02:30.010> five

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
for instance if we're playing a two five

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.759 
for instance if we're playing a two five
one<00:02:30.430> progression<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.120> minor<00:02:37.470> well<00:02:38.470> then<00:02:38.620> we

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
one progression and minor well then we

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.620 
one progression and minor well then we
have<00:02:38.799> an<00:02:39.010> alter<00:02:39.280> v<00:02:39.579> on<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.940> first<00:02:40.150> chord<00:02:40.480> on

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
have an alter v on that first chord on

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.390 
have an alter v on that first chord on
the<00:02:40.660> two<00:02:40.930> which<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.290> generally<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.769> minor<00:02:42.010> seven

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
the two which is generally a minor seven

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.129 
the two which is generally a minor seven
flat<00:02:42.430> five<00:02:42.639> so<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.269> would<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> d<00:02:43.780> minor<00:02:43.989> 7

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
flat five so this would be a d minor 7

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.309 
flat five so this would be a d minor 7
flat<00:02:44.440> 5<00:02:45.209> then<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.480> five<00:02:46.720> becomes<00:02:47.139> really

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
flat 5 then that five becomes really

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.009 
flat 5 then that five becomes really
important<00:02:47.859> but<00:02:48.579> anytime<00:02:49.389> we're<00:02:49.720> playing<00:02:49.900> in

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
important but anytime we're playing in

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.870 
important but anytime we're playing in
major<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.500> five<00:02:50.769> really<00:02:51.160> isn't<00:02:51.400> important

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
major that five really isn't important

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.819 
major that five really isn't important
in<00:02:52.000> fact<00:02:52.269> when<00:02:52.690> we're<00:02:52.810> soloing<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.380> flat<00:02:53.620> that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
in fact when we're soloing we flat that

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.900 
in fact when we're soloing we flat that
five<00:02:54.100> all<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.430> time<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> blue<00:02:55.569> note<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.530> as

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
five all the time as a blue note so as

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.930 
five all the time as a blue note so as
someone<00:02:57.910> who's<00:02:58.120> copping<00:02:59.430> or<00:03:00.430> even<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:00.760> someone

someone who's copping or even as someone
who's<00:03:01.120> soloing<00:03:01.569> don't<00:03:01.930> worry<00:03:02.109> about<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
who's soloing don't worry about the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.780 
who's soloing don't worry about the
fifth<00:03:02.650> your<00:03:02.859> most<00:03:03.010> important<00:03:03.430> notes<00:03:03.639> are

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
fifth your most important notes are

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.849 
fifth your most important notes are
always<00:03:03.940> your<00:03:04.329> third<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.660> your<00:03:04.690> seventh<00:03:05.139> so

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
always your third in your seventh so

let's<00:03:06.040> start<00:03:06.280> out<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.579> D<00:03:06.700> minor<00:03:06.940> 7<00:03:07.380> what

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
let's start out with the D minor 7 what

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.110 
let's start out with the D minor 7 what
are<00:03:08.470> our<00:03:08.500> guide<00:03:08.799> tones<00:03:09.160> for<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.579> if<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:09.970> take

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
are our guide tones for that if we take

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.680 
are our guide tones for that if we take
a<00:03:10.180> look<00:03:10.450> deep<00:03:11.079> F<00:03:11.440> mean<00:03:11.829> see<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:13.239> 3rd<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
a look deep F mean see the 3rd and the
