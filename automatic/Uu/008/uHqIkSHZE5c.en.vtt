00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
it's close to mine to my body because a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.910 
it's close to mine to my body because a
lot<00:01:01.970> of<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.120> places<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.690> go<00:01:02.900> into<00:01:03.140> there's

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
lot of the places that I go into there's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.380 
lot of the places that I go into there's
a<00:01:03.950> lot<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.220> brush<00:01:04.520> and<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:04.820> want<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.119> try<00:01:05.330> to

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
a lot of brush and I want to try to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.219 
a lot of brush and I want to try to
limit<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.910> hang-ups<00:01:08.390> as<00:01:08.630> much<00:01:08.810> as<00:01:08.990> possible

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
limit the hang-ups as much as possible

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.270 
limit the hang-ups as much as possible
so<00:01:09.800> I<00:01:10.640> find<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.630> I'm<00:01:11.930> I'm<00:01:12.380> leaning<00:01:13.070> more

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
so I find that that I'm I'm leaning more

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.710 
so I find that that I'm I'm leaning more
and<00:01:13.340> more<00:01:13.610> toward<00:01:14.360> context<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.580> know<00:01:17.270> it's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
and more toward context and I know it's

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
and more toward context and I know it's
it's<00:01:18.320> not<00:01:18.410> traditional<00:01:18.770> that's<00:01:19.490> frowned<00:01:19.729> upon

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
it's not traditional that's frowned upon

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's not traditional that's frowned upon
in<00:01:20.300> certain<00:01:20.570> places<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.610> want<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.670> give<00:01:23.090> you

in certain places so I want to give you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.059 
in certain places so I want to give you
my<00:01:25.060> opinion<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:27.350> course<00:01:27.410> that's<00:01:27.740> what<00:01:27.890> little

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
my opinion of course that's what little

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.200 
my opinion of course that's what little
talks<00:01:28.340> are<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.940> my<00:01:29.149> opinion<00:01:30.130> why<00:01:31.130> I'm<00:01:31.610> leaning

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
talks are is my opinion why I'm leaning

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.710 
talks are is my opinion why I'm leaning
more<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.450> more<00:01:32.660> toward<00:01:33.140> X<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.910> main<00:01:35.149> thing<00:01:35.450> is

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
more and more toward X the main thing is

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.840 
more and more toward X the main thing is
in<00:01:35.990> my<00:01:36.979> area<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.819> is<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.330> humid<00:01:38.660> that<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:39.850> sweat

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
in my area it is so humid that I sweat

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.719 
in my area it is so humid that I sweat
like<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.209> pig<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.899> leather<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.860> mean<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.520> will

like a pig and leather I mean I will

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.240 
like a pig and leather I mean I will
have<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.209> just<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.780> little<00:01:45.259> bit<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.679> it<00:01:46.130> will

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
have it on just a little bit and it will

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.120 
have it on just a little bit and it will
be<00:01:46.369> completely<00:01:46.850> sucked<00:01:48.039> from<00:01:49.039> sweat<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:51.130> I

use high carbon steel either oh one or
two<00:01:56.270> 95<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.679> means<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.069> my<00:01:58.250> blade<00:01:58.580> is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
two 95 so that means that my blade is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.359 
two 95 so that means that my blade is
sitting<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.479> wet<00:01:59.810> leather<00:02:00.110> most<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.160> time

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
sitting in wet leather most of the time

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.839 
sitting in wet leather most of the time
there<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.789> summer<00:02:02.890> late<00:02:03.890> spring<00:02:04.429> early

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
there in the summer late spring early

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.990 
there in the summer late spring early
fall<00:02:05.950> time<00:02:06.950> periods<00:02:07.840> excuse<00:02:08.840> me<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.310> prefer

fall time periods excuse me so I prefer

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.460 
fall time periods excuse me so I prefer
I<00:02:11.569> find<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.980> context<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.959> better

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
I find that the context is is a better

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.080 
I find that the context is is a better
product<00:02:16.130> because<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:18.069> also<00:02:19.090> when

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
product because of that also when

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.050 
product because of that also when
leather<00:02:20.360> gets<00:02:20.750> wet<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.580> your<00:02:22.730> belt

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
leather gets wet if it's in your belt

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.570 
leather gets wet if it's in your belt
and<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.900> have<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> knife<00:02:24.470> out<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.099> you're

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
and you have a knife out and you're

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.250 
and you have a knife out and you're
bending<00:02:25.819> over<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.390> doing<00:02:26.540> tasks<00:02:26.959> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
bending over and doing tasks and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.140 
bending over and doing tasks and
whatever<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.340> start<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.700> put<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> knife

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
whatever and you start to put the knife

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.510 
whatever and you start to put the knife
back

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
back

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.880 
back
and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.210> be<00:02:30.300> very<00:02:30.630> careful<00:02:31.170> because

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and you have to be very careful because

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.450 
and you have to be very careful because
remember<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.540> cut<00:02:36.680> okay<00:02:37.680> remember<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:40.460> it's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
remember the cut okay remember that it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.540 
remember the cut okay remember that it's
better<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.820> finger<00:02:42.300> than<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> stomach<00:02:42.990> okay<00:02:43.830> so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
better a finger than a stomach okay so

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.510 
better a finger than a stomach okay so
I'm<00:02:44.880> finding<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.960> trust<00:02:46.830> context

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
I'm finding that that I trust context

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.770 
I'm finding that that I trust context
more<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.150> can<00:02:51.150> pull<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.570> knife

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
more because I can I can pull the knife

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.800
