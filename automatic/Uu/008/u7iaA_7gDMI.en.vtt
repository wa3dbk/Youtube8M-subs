that these shelves

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.740 
that these shelves
go<00:00:45.230> from<00:00:45.590> here<00:00:45.700> to<00:00:46.700> here<00:00:47.060> and<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:47.390> believe<00:00:47.600> it

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
go from here to here and I believe it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.620

is<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.760> wasn't<00:02:38.000> utilizing<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.230> space<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:41.030> I

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
is I wasn't utilizing the space that I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.770 
is I wasn't utilizing the space that I
have<00:02:41.590> at<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.830> top<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.310> shelf<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.239> up<00:02:44.569> here

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
have at the top of the shelf so up here

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.470 
have at the top of the shelf so up here
I<00:02:44.840> had<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> bunch<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.560> curses<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.489> different

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I had a bunch of curses and different

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.170 
I had a bunch of curses and different
things<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.530> didn't<00:02:49.459> want<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.670> keep<00:02:49.790> buying

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
things and I didn't want to keep buying

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.930 
things and I didn't want to keep buying
more<00:02:50.569> shelves<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> realized<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.489> should

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
more shelves so I realized that I should

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.350 
more shelves so I realized that I should
go<00:02:53.540> ahead<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.170> put<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.550> know<00:02:55.670> these<00:02:55.970> boots

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
go ahead and put you know these boots

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.560 
go ahead and put you know these boots
that<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.959> up<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.120> someone<00:02:59.120> actually

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
that I have up here and someone actually

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.040 
that I have up here and someone actually
suggested<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.380> put<00:03:00.800> magazines<00:03:01.930> inside<00:03:02.930> of

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
suggested that I put magazines inside of

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.449 
suggested that I put magazines inside of
the<00:03:03.110> boot<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.680> they<00:03:03.800> stand<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.190> straight

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
the boot so that they stand up straight

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.130 
the boot so that they stand up straight
which<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:05.420> was<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:05.900> great<00:03:06.019> idea

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
which I think was a really great idea

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.199 
which I think was a really great idea
because<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.950> was<00:03:06.980> actually<00:03:07.280> about<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.760> go<00:03:08.030> buy

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
because I was actually about to go buy

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.350 
because I was actually about to go buy
boot<00:03:08.989> holders<00:03:09.709> or<00:03:09.950> something<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.819> stand<00:03:11.030> boots

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
boot holders or something to stand boots

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.790 
boot holders or something to stand boots
up<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.470> here<00:03:12.890> on<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.730> very<00:03:13.970> end<00:03:14.800> the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
up and so here on the very end the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.259 
up and so here on the very end the
shelving<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.640> look<00:03:16.790> exactly<00:03:16.970> like

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
top of each other and they go perfectly

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.970

with the other shelving and it looks
like<00:03:43.220> one<00:03:44.230> continuous<00:03:45.230> wall<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:46.519> shelving

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
like one continuous wall the shelving

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.970 
like one continuous wall the shelving
that<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.810> know<00:03:47.930> we<00:03:48.170> wound<00:03:48.410> up<00:03:48.530> buying<00:03:48.769> this

thinking that we're gonna be able to fit

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.289 
thinking that we're gonna be able to fit
more<00:03:50.420> shoes<00:03:50.989> into<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.609> actually<00:03:52.760> wound

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
more shoes into it and it actually wound

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.630 
more shoes into it and it actually wound
up<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.959> know<00:03:54.079> only<00:03:54.410> being<00:03:54.709> on<00:03:54.829> fit<00:03:55.070> one<00:03:55.340> shoe

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
up you know only being on fit one shoe

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.030 
up you know only being on fit one shoe
in<00:03:55.850> each<00:03:56.000> small<00:03:56.420> hole<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.230> went<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.769> ahead

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
in each small hole so I went on ahead

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.240 
in each small hole so I went on ahead
and<00:03:58.430> put<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.030> right<00:03:59.269> there<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.380> have<00:04:00.890> one

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and put that right there so I have one

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.300 
and put that right there so I have one
continuous<00:04:02.060> wall<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:03.019> shoes<00:04:03.290> hopefully<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
continuous wall of shoes hopefully I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.550 
continuous wall of shoes hopefully I
will<00:04:04.670> not<00:04:04.820> be<00:04:05.030> expanding<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.840> shoe<00:04:06.049> wall<00:04:06.290> any

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
will not be expanding the shoe wall any

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.840 
will not be expanding the shoe wall any
further<00:04:08.049> before<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.350> believe<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.920> had<00:04:10.100> like<00:04:10.250> 75

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
further before I believe I had like 75

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.449 
further before I believe I had like 75
pairs<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.329> shoes<00:04:11.510> right<00:04:11.870> now<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.859> think<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.280> is

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
pairs of shoes right now I think this is

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.740 
pairs of shoes right now I think this is
somewhere<00:04:13.880> around<00:04:14.709> 200<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:16.539> counted<00:04:17.539> them<00:04:17.630> a

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
somewhere around 200 I counted them a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.880 
somewhere around 200 I counted them a
little<00:04:17.959> while<00:04:18.079> ago<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.620> forgotten

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
little while ago and I have forgotten

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.210 
little while ago and I have forgotten
how<00:04:19.220> much<00:04:19.400> how<00:04:19.820> many<00:04:20.060> shoes<00:04:20.269> that<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.539> have<00:04:20.750> here

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
how much how many shoes that I have here

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.590 
how much how many shoes that I have here
and<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.280> know<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:22.910> didn't<00:04:23.270> take<00:04:23.390> any

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
and I know I didn't take any

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.240 
and I know I didn't take any
measurements<00:04:23.930> before<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.650> bought<00:04:24.830> any<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:25.160> the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
measurements before I bought any of the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.370 
measurements before I bought any of the
shoe<00:04:25.430> shelves<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:26.120> basically<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.600> started

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
shoe shelves I basically just started

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.529 
shoe shelves I basically just started
out<00:04:27.470> with<00:04:27.590> one<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.160> then<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.760> wound<00:04:29.090> up<00:04:29.240> going

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
out with one and then I wound up going

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.279 
out with one and then I wound up going
back<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.840> getting<00:04:29.930> on

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
back and getting on

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.339 
back and getting on
another<00:04:30.439> one<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:32.360> just<00:04:32.689> kind<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.110> turned
