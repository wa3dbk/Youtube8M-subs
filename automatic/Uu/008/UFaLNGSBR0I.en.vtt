V<00:03:05.700> loggers<00:03:06.060> atlas<00:03:06.540> rider<00:03:07.370> now<00:03:08.370> he<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.760> actually

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.010 

I<00:03:11.810> believe<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:13.070> first<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:14.090> first<00:03:14.390> or<00:03:14.600> second

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
I believe the first the first or second

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.330 
I believe the first the first or second
motorcycle<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.590> longer<00:03:15.890> than<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.250> ever<00:03:16.280> saw

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
motorcycle be longer than I ever saw

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.390 
motorcycle be longer than I ever saw
apparently<00:03:19.840> not<00:03:20.840> only<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:23.120> he<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.780> to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
apparently not only is he going to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800 
apparently not only is he going to
travel<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.700> entire<00:03:25.730> length<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
travel the entire length of the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.350 
travel the entire length of the
pan-american<00:03:27.500> highway<00:03:27.920> down<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.120> tip<00:03:29.330> of

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
South America or something he is for no

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.940 
South America or something he is for no
reason<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.780> really<00:03:36.140> see<00:03:36.410> going

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
reason that I can really see going

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.450 
reason that I can really see going
driving<00:03:37.700> up<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.210> Chicago<00:03:38.830> Confed<00:03:39.830> coming<00:03:40.220> back

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
driving up to Chicago Confed coming back

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.560 
driving up to Chicago Confed coming back
as<00:03:40.730> if<00:03:41.270> as<00:03:41.450> if<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.170> trip<00:03:42.440> wasn't<00:03:42.650> long<00:03:43.010> enough

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
as if as if the trip wasn't long enough

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.420 
as if as if the trip wasn't long enough
so<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.600> mean<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.350> pretty<00:03:45.380> hardcore<00:03:48.430> even

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
so I mean that is pretty hardcore even

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.060 
so I mean that is pretty hardcore even
though<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.640> know<00:03:49.970> honestly<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:51.080> would<00:03:51.920> have

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
though you know honestly I would have

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.600 
though you know honestly I would have
preferred<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.700> he<00:03:53.030> kept<00:03:53.330> his<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:55.130> know<00:03:55.190> safe

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
preferred that he kept his you know safe

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.850 
preferred that he kept his you know safe
to<00:03:55.790> 650<00:03:56.420> instead<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.050> what<00:03:57.380> does<00:03:57.470> he<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
to 650 instead of what does he have the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.140 
to 650 instead of what does he have the
kill<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:59.920> just<00:04:00.920> for<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.220> sake<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.910> know

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.130 

yes<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:07.340> new<00:04:07.550> bike<00:04:07.820> was<00:04:08.300> probably<00:04:08.900> better

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
yes the the new bike was probably better

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.530 
yes the the new bike was probably better
especially<00:04:10.040> if<00:04:10.520> he<00:04:10.640> goes<00:04:10.850> into<00:04:11.060> some<00:04:11.330> rugged

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
especially if he goes into some rugged

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.840 
especially if he goes into some rugged
terrain<00:04:12.880> but<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:13.970> mean<00:04:14.180> who<00:04:14.510> actually<00:04:15.489> who<00:04:16.489> but

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
terrain but I mean who actually who but

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.550 
terrain but I mean who actually who but
a<00:04:16.880> motorcycle<00:04:17.570> v<00:04:17.690> lager<00:04:17.900> would<00:04:18.200> be<00:04:18.320> dumb

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
a motorcycle v lager would be dumb

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.759 
a motorcycle v lager would be dumb
enough<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:19.430> travel<00:04:19.700> great<00:04:20.030> distances<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:21.530> a

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
enough to travel great distances on a

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.800 
enough to travel great distances on a
completely<00:04:22.400> uncomfortable<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.480> unpractical

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
completely uncomfortable and unpractical

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.980 
completely uncomfortable and unpractical
sport<00:04:24.470> bike<00:04:24.790> that's<00:04:25.790> what<00:04:25.970> makes<00:04:26.210> us<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.690> great

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
sport bike that's what makes us so great

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.210 
sport bike that's what makes us so great
I<00:04:27.320> think

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
I think

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.540 
I think
whoa<00:04:29.760> whoa<00:04:30.650> anyway<00:04:31.650> that's<00:04:32.190> some<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
whoa whoa anyway that's some of the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.750 
whoa whoa anyway that's some of the
stuff<00:04:33.030> I've<00:04:33.180> missed<00:04:33.420> out<00:04:33.630> on

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.600 

it<00:04:36.330> feels<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:36.780> good<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:37.320> be<00:04:37.710> back<00:04:38.010> out<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
it feels so good to be back out in the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.280 
it feels so good to be back out in the
daylight<00:04:38.790> I've<00:04:39.210> read<00:04:39.570> about<00:04:39.720> every<00:04:40.080> day<00:04:40.230> but

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
daylight I've read about every day but

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.140 
daylight I've read about every day but
it's<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:41.700> in<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.000> middle<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.330> night<00:04:42.540> and

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
it's it's in the middle of the night and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.660 
it's it's in the middle of the night and
then<00:04:45.150> I'll<00:04:45.270> be<00:04:45.390> honest<00:04:45.780> daya<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.680> did<00:04:47.280> squid<00:04:47.640> a

then I'll be honest daya I did squid a

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.490 
then I'll be honest daya I did squid a
couple<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.060> times<00:04:48.180> I've<00:04:48.840> always<00:04:49.110> had<00:04:49.350> my

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
couple of times I've always had my

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.320 
couple of times I've always had my
helmet<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.950> course<00:04:50.900> but<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.430> did<00:04:53.430> go<00:04:53.760> jacket

i think it is only fair that I admit

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.920 
i think it is only fair that I admit
that<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.600> this<00:05:01.260> have<00:05:01.530> done<00:05:01.770> this<00:05:02.300> anyway<00:05:03.300> I've

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
that I this have done this anyway I've
