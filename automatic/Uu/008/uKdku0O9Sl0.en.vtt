00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.910
 Party and seasonal flowers with a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.910
 design of darío cárdenas welcome 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.030
 we open today's closet to answer 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.740
 the question that is being used that 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.349

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.360
 fashion today then I will tell you they are 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.940
 fashion botanical prints 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.280
 art prints and fashion are the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.710
 blocks of color the black and white the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.690
 geometry and some military details and 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 Kimonos are fashionable as a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.650
 homage to oriental philosophy in the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.600
 trend of botanical printing 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.640
 we choose those garments that they have in 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.710
 the background foliage and leaves as if 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.540
 you were seeing vegetation what 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.430
 you can wear on skirts in dresses or in 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.620
 shirts and if you are a little more 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.030
 risky or risky then choose 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.190
 the pineapple print that is the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.080
 stamping of the moment in the trend 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.180
 sports if you are going to choose those 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.430
 garments that look like they're taken out of the gym 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.409
 but be elaborated on fabrics a little 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.760
 more sophisticated is to say a sweatshirt 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.100
 but that comes in a kind of 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.810
 polyester a champagne type shirt 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.210
 but that comes elaborated in one more fabric 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 silky or a shirt but that you see it 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.140
 and it seems much more sophisticated than the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.479
 what do you use for the gym the same thing 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.910
 you can do with the arm trend and use 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.440
 those garments that look like the soldier who 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.280
 they look like exits from a military regiment 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.960
 but who are 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.940
 for you to use them can be a 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.979
 Camouflage pants a jacket with a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.810
 road with a military detail or 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.390
 any garment that is in that tone 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.280
 military green and another trend today is the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.900
 art and that means when you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.880
 you look at the garment it's as if you had a 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.860
 fine artwork that was painted by hand 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.909
 or that is dotted as if the painter 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.909
 I would have used that garment 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.860
