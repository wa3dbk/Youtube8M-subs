 dear welcome back friends want to know 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 the secrets for a perfect home 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.030
 organized we discover together 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 today we have invited you to our friend 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.650
 elena who will explain some techniques to us 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 of basic sewing such as how 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.130
 mending a sock 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.130
 thanks daniela we can start 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.790
 usually when you pierce a sock and yes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 hurry to repair the hole one uses a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 fixed point 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 that is, many small ones are made with the thread 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.450
 dashes to join the edges of the hole that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.420
 the problem has been created which is the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.140
 the point where the sock is pierced is that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 where the light rubs against the shoe and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.350
 so if there is a seam detected 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.079
 that thing at the point where the light 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.210
 touches the shoe from a great annoyance to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.840
 this one uses a point that is called 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 just weaving and that is a little bit 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 secret of the grandmothers to run it you will have 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.229
 need a new wood is this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.960
 object here is found in the haberdasheries e 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.229
 it is cheap and very very useful because there 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 keeps the edges of the sock open and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:34.110
 so you can do this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:37.950
 here we go then we take more needle and thread 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 or less than the color of the sock more or less 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 take a long guided tour e 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 struck lake yes 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.770
 and then make a knot at the bottom of the stitch 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.869
 weaving as the name implies 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:05.470
 mending it would be more correct is precisely 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.470
 a weave with warp and weft 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.790
 improves strung lake so that the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:19.220
 nodino remains inside the sock 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.480
 do a dot anyway to stop the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.060
 wire 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 and then perform a series of frattini 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.940
 you simply have to throw points 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.030
 from one side of the hole 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.239
 these points will be close to each other 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.750
 they will be closed and the hole will be less 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.190
 transparent we say at the end you will have 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 a whole series of passing bars 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.930
 above the hole at this point we have 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.180
 made the weft of our seam 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.700
 we must make the warp and then we pass 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.459
 with the needle above and below each individual 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.670
 point in order to create a true e 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.930
 own weaving in alternating step 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.430
 over a thread and under firm when 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.430
 he came to the other side 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.720
 I go back and do the opposite 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.060
 where I had passed over it passed under and 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:31.430
 vice versa when you have finished 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:37.780
 given a dot book they gave so for 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.780
 close the seam 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.200
 and cut the thread and voila the sock e 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.390
 sheltered 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.390
 thanks to everyone for the next good job
