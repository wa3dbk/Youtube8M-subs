now so that's why you can see it's such
an<00:02:06.360> easy<00:02:06.600> recipe<00:02:06.950> I'm<00:02:07.950> putting<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.670> my<00:02:08.759> food

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
an easy recipe I'm putting into my food

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.160 
an easy recipe I'm putting into my food
processor<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:11.150> while<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
processor and while it is about the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.480 
processor and while it is about the
process<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.890> add<00:02:14.070> some<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
process I'm going to add some of the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.150 
process I'm going to add some of the
water<00:02:14.670> about<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.209> quarter<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.690> cup

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160

you know enough water until it goes into
like<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> doughy<00:02:22.260> sort<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.130> texture<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.970> this

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
like a doughy sort of texture like this

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.220 
like a doughy sort of texture like this
and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.500> easy<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.860> roll<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.160> balls
