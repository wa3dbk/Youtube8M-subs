00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello to all his friends and welcome 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.529
 you on this video then today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 it will be a mix between what's new 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.220
 a program of the week of the gr tv 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.830
 I have a few things to tell you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 so we start right away with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 conventions actually this year not the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 less than I know for the moment 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 so I had announced there is a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.250
 moment on twitter and all I was going 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.990
 that I will surely be at the paris games 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 weekend 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 unfortunately I will not be able to be there 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 simply because the fees 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.510
 accommodation plus the cost of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 moving over the square instead 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.420
 in the beach and an accreditation for 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.059
 have it but the traveling expenses 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 more accommodation it costs me too much 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.930
 for a day cg it's part of my 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.410
 means for now I can not get it to myself 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 to permit 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 on the other hand where it's cool is that I 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.539
 go to tgs in toulouse game show car 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 this is for those who smoke a little 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.800
 the lives our moderator 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 one of the moderators on the gaming group 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.870
 if he lodges me with mr of april too 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.719
 for those who know short so I 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.640
 will be at the DGS logically the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.700
 two days so there if you can come 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 there you will see it is sure and certain 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 both days it is not sure yet 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.360
 but I 'll be at least saturday for sure 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 and certain 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.600
 but here, but logically, both 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.610
 days it will be manageable since 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.409
 this is where we are, so here we go 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.740
 so there will be just the move to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 to do by train and places to pay or 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 suddenly there is less accommodation 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.540
 at ten already has nothing to do it costs 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.470
 a lot because for the paris games 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.689
 weekend he had to keep a little bit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.729
 the cheapest hotels it was 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.740
 75 euros next to what I can pay 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.229
 by car otherwise faceted and boring I 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.700
 will be there by train and suddenly at the turn of the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 door of versailles I think it's 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.990
 the hotels is a sick thing so 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.119
 75 ball just to sleep a night in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.280
 a hotel no i can not afford it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.290
 to pay that unfortunately 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 so here I am not at the paris games 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 sorry week I hope to do everything for there 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 attack next by cons it will be at 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.939
 tgs and may give others until 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 there but I'll talk about it again in a 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.729
 other video 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.770
 so before moving on to the program of the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.020
 week of the stream 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.480
 I wanted to talk to you something if you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.470
 you may be from there 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.960
 zik from the art of music be 2 step 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.980
 electro or even more classical music 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.170
 and you want a little bit of 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.040
 make yourself known to do to do 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.630
 listen to your music to the world know 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.370
 that I'm looking for all the time in 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.460
 makes people who can send me 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.620
 music so of course you'll have so 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.970
 the music is in my videos cmc 6.9 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.190
 I love him so much for a video since 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.570
 often when I make videos in 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.060
 general is the music that fished 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.740
 since my the general idea I lai the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 realization I can do it to you 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.010
 are still mine music at the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.380
 music is very very complicated at this 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.460
 that our musics free of right that we 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.260
 can put on monetized videos 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.730
 it's very very hard to find 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.720
 so in fact that's why at each 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.790
 times his opinion of blood but video on 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.110
 often find the same songs so 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.430
 I already had keynes is who made me 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.180
 music and have always been very 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.650
 I'm sorry to apologize 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.920
 it's not that I'm the viroquois I 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.240
 keep with me there he stays but have 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.170
 always several musicians 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.280
 other people who are doing 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 music for you it's always this 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.500
 always cool so of course me I put 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.140
 whenever I think about it 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.550
 general I think the name and the eurl if 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.100
 you have a youtube link a link from 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.020
 site to anything in the video is 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.730
 also in the description of the video 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.959
 so that's if you want to do 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.070
 share a little bit your music 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.640
 take you to do a little bit more 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.739
 know 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.080
 listen send me a mail blow to 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.690
 contact @ sir nvidia points like 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.739
 and we can we can discuss it 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.270
 will be able to see a little bit of what is happening 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.860
 so I'm not saying that I take all 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.860
 the songs you're going to give me that's going 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.090
 maybe not like me maybe not 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.959
 to be to the taste of what I want it 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.480
 do not put in my videos 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.100
 but do not hesitate to send some if 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.900
 you see one but do not send me even 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.720
 kind of yeah I would be interested for 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.830
 do send me direct troyes of 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.090
 three songs that I can listen to 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.830
 right now it's useless to 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.379
 to send me an email without the songs 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.879
 So here you go, but always make mans 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.390
 that it's songs that gives the 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.980
 potato 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.209
 in fact you see what I see these 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.769
 songs that give the smile when you 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.390
 listening you were many cases the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.099
 video tumors you noticed it in 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.480
 general that it is to do is to 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.459
 give the artois good mood 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 cause a little bit there the good 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.910
 mood of people and suddenly if I 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.400
 wait for a song that makes you depress 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.660
 on mounting and all it will not me it 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.989

 not the little promo or little stuff 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.130

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.460
 take a ride it's really really 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.720
 really classy we have fun all the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.210
 little old school and sweet to be able to 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.010
 give a little encouragement from 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.539
 costs of 3 I think that's a game 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.889
 that I will lead perhaps to the end 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.139

 it will be a wrong z and if I die 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.529
 will see we will do other things on 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:43.009
 minecraft it will stay from minecraft is 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:44.389
 so Sunday, November 3 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.819
 so it's still to be confirmed because 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.239
 dark that confirms that to me but logically 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:53.089
 is 17:00 midnight of stream so 

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:55.219
 stream area in the company of daft 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:57.979
 for not knowing each other at once 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:59.749
 get to know him where we will be in 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.729
 did we see a little concept 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.499
 in fact he is strong at certain games 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.360
 I'm pretty good at other games 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:07.550
 and suddenly we will do a little trick 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.919
 like that is to say that we will do the 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.139
 daddy lepreau and us but the guy who 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.939
 know the game and noob so that will be 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.589
 me the guy he knows game will be for 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.659
 minecraft but he knows very very little 

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:19.039
 the game he starts there on minecraft and we 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:20.809
 can be reversed like this several 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.979
 times I think about games like him by 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:24.139
 example he can do it on quake 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.449
 although I know almost nothing about 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.099
 all so suddenly it will be him the guy 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.419
 who handles well on quake and me the noob 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.249
 so at the break it will be a small 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.899
 evening like that fun where we will exchange 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.979
 like that games we will also do other 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:35.269
 games because for seven hours of the 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:37.309
 We will have enough to do 

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:38.689
 so here is the little program 

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:40.529
 from the week until Sunday 3 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.819
 November 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:42.779
 so I hope you like it 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:45.119
