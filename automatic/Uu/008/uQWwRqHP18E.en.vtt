00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.799
 the group 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.670
 Save me, I'm here to show you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.860
 you a tutorial wanted neguim mice 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 Come on, let's see this machine. 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.690
 will take it out now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.580
 He aimed the grenade at that spot there. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 He's doing well. The grenade is going to launch. 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.050
 grenades and will get the face bomb law 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.050
 were kill 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.040
 the second tip he's gonna give us 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.199
 here today it 's just from here there's actually it 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.540
 will show where the grenade will fall 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.950
 You can see where he threw it at that time. 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.820
 she fell 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 then the guy has scoring there will die 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.739
 now there's this one here that 's fine 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.200
 I do not think that for those who already fight 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.750
 this is nothing new 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.560
 here we are seeing a northern face 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.530
 or in the housing by a pump pump pump 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.470
 died 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 we have this other one here you come 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 It 's interesting here, I think it's 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.090
 did not remember right in and here and here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 From here on, oh man, did you get the guy? 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 we have the other that is another I think there are 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.349
 a choice at a time, see you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 showing where it is taking shot there 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.179
 so already knowing it still took a shot 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 there can be up here now will 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.740
 I think it's a sport that 's a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 granada 'la olla' threw the grenade and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.130
 Cuba 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.220
 got the player down there and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.679
 showed where the boy was on the TV where 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.649
 he was in the boxes and the grenade 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.140
 fell well on his side saw then tip 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.690
 cool then the other is that I think you 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.590
 have already seen another video lesson but it is 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 similar is the same as shooting a license 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 then will show a guy is there is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.959
 normal for the world to stay so I stayed until 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.780
 Where do I know who is the one not to talk? 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.250
 it was plowing so that's where the ball comes from 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.599
 so is it folks hope 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.599
 I liked it, worth another
