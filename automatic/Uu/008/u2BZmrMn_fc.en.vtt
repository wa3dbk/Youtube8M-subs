00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.460
 Now everyone if I put the hair 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 darker and I also cut it is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 a super long story I can only 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.059
 say that in less than two days I've had 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 the hair three colors purple black and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 now this one I have a little damaged but 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.199
 well I'll tell you in a video or what 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 that is if it interests but good a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.920
 disaster and if you ask me if I 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.090
 I liked secular I do not like it but I think 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.130
 that was necessary because the color that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 I had at least the sun when there 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.020
 stuck the light was too orange and 9 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 and I did not look good with him it did not seem 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.350
 elegant I did not like how it was 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 so ma I did not want to put color 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 of hair and has gone through three phases 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.970
 which I do not recommend any once 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.250
 said this to tell you that in this video os 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 I bring a vintage set of clothes that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.180
 I bought on the trail you know that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.130
 I have a little obsession with the trail 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.040
 and buy me blouses for a euro or 50 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.050
 cents and nothing I hope that I marry you to see 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.660
 the video the first thing that I bought in the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.310
 trace were these levi's are the 501 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 They are the same as those I have shot 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.869
 high that yes I did not buy them long because 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.680
 they sold them long and I cut them 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.120
 it goes super well 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 and I recommend you if you are interested 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.230
 with this kind of pants before going 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 to the malasaÃ±a stores that are 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.950
 actually in court because it I 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.870
 I already recommend a thousand times to go to the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.240
 trace because stores can you 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.310
 cost the pants thirty euros and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 here you are worth ten and we went to the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.820
 blouses I bought six blouses not all 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 the things that I am going to teach you are 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.460
 vintage there is everything and good the first 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 which is a signal is this is from ryanair 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.790
 he took a lot last season 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 The only thing I do not like very much is the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.440
 neck surely I put it in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.300
 but good is that for one euro is super 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 well it's long sleeve and now with the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.140
 slight that you just taught tucked by 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
 inside and some military boots I think that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.780
 it looks great 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.000
 and the other thing you have seen me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.619
 I put in my previous make up pro video 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 team and many like you or at least 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.640
 how hard in comments and is this blue 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.780
 I do not know what the prints are if I 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 I'm telling the truth, it's not super good 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.520
 It is also long sleeve and I love it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 I wear it less or put on jeans 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 claritos and some sneakers or with some 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.390
 plays that I bought that are not juvara 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.430
 they are new bar 11 they are fake but good 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.060
 they like it equally and it also cost me a 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.220
 euro 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 This is one of the most extravagant 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.720
 I have put it on and my friends say 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.459
 which is a small child's pajamas or 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.770
 will design very old but good to me 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.170
 love it and I think if you can combine it 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.000
 can be super good is to say that no 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.440
 I think that everyone likes this 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.540
 type of clothes but good you know 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.519
 what is my style I am very strange do not you 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 My defined sample I like a little 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.120
 everything and the truth is that I like these 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.610
 things and that's why he keeps them 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.430
 well the blouse in question is this one has 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.130
 planes and dots and stripes I think it's a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.950
 I love it I think it's perfect too 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.239
 I would also put it with one with 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.060
 some pants of the car he got 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.400
 inside with a tube skirt or with a few 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.500
 jeans then finally the ones that I 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 they liked a euro is this land this 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.299
 new super simple is pretty short 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.400
 that I really like has a little 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.519
 detail in what is the area of the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
 buttons and the neck is very simple and the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.830
 fabric is super soft the truth is that I 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.900
 he has 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.720
 I liked the touch and then it has 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.350
 some details very nice buttons 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 They are golden and well this blouse with a 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.580
 skirt life because then to get out of 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.650
 party with pants so more 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.860
 arranged or a tube skirt or ones 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.200
 jeans and I think it looks good these 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.060
 two that I 'm going to show you cost me 50 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.190
 cents each one of them does not 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.020
 I like it too much but if I did not take it 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.450
 the other one did not cost me 50 cents and the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.010
 another one that I liked so nothing 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.350
 I'm going to teach the one I like a little bit 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.270
 less is very old lady is worth not me 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.560
 mate and I reiterate and say there is no other 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.950
 world was a like that kind of garments 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 that one is this 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.310
 It's pretty weird but good to the best 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.680
 I can combine it with something so that 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.480
 Like it, but I'm not going to 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.989
 promise to wear it because I do not know if it's going 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.849
 to like how it looks but I bought it 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.550
 because I liked this shirt but 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.410
 designed now this shirt in question 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.450
 it cost me 50 cents like the other one and 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.870
 that I bought the other one as I said and 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.139
 is this seems to me beautiful I think that as 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.810
 a brown jeans pants 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.540
 mild even put some inside 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.669
 boots that I will look super good and for 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.190
 at least I liked the 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.290
 vintage clothing has already finished I feel if 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.110
 I have repeated a word but good 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.360
 the following are two mango things I 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.490
 I do not know if you're like me not 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.440
 I had nothing of mac and you always have to 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.540
 have something I thought about water when I won 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.550
 my first salary sure I bought 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.070
 a thousand other things other things nothing is 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.540
 return although very much and nothing after 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.419
 of Christmas they gave me some money 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.129
 and as I have enough clothes as you see 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.929
 I decided to treat myself and I decided to 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.580
 two visits of tuesday leave super 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:57.110
 excited about the book store that the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.399
 people are watching me from the face of 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.419
 happiness because they are two things 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.860
 makeup that can be a little 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.569
 materialist but the truth is that I 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.189
 I was very excited because I did not have 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.979
 nothing more and always had made me very 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.719
 seriously buy me something and one of them is 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.300
 a lipstick like I think you can 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:15.619
 imagine is a color jobs in question is 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.349
 the one that had that is a crim sin and is a 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:20.089
 perfect color I like very much 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.519
 is the one that I'm wearing right now is super 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.199
 creamy and durability I think it's 

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.839
 pretty good but I can not tell you that 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.509
 last longer than others that I have minor 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.990
 price and other brands and the other thing that I 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.580
 I bought from Marc was this blusher that 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.309
 I had heard a lot of this package 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.289
 is the ginger lee of mac but when I 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.029
 I bought it at the stand I did not notice 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.469
 the name and I noticed the color I liked 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.259
 and then I realized it was this 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.540
 tone the color of rouge is a color 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.960
 Brown 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.419
 unless controlled for example 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.130
 and the truth is that it is super nice but 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.069
 it's really good for me, you can see it there 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.020
 I hope you see it and it's very good and I 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.940
 love as I have told you many times 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.289
 half strong I do not like to apply them 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.539
 what is the area of the manzanitas 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.240
 because having a round face, I think 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.229
 it accentuates me that way and I like it more 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 apply it 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.580
 by the cheekbones or by the contour and what 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.500
 last makeup that I bought was 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.970
 of the brand slick of the schleck brand 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.069
 I only have a lipstick I had never tried 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.280
 no type of blush or shade or 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.289
 nothing and I really liked this face 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.840
 force is a feat that contains 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.849
 blusher outline the illuminator is in the 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.680
 medium tone so the computer is going 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.030
 a bit dark but it's like the 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.410
 outline of the like was that I came 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.690
 pretty clear by now you do not know no I 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.900
 liked and good are these colors are 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.039
 perfect for me I love I know 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.840
 This is the outline that I know I have 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.820
 right now put the illuminator and the 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.009
 blusher in question good I hope that 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.100
 you liked this young man and a little thing 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.430
 plus 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.780
 you remember the michael video 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.820
 obsession that I made myself a makeup that 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.190
 It was a shadow open the eyelashes 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.380
 inferiors that I told you that he was interested 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.630
 I was uploading it I do not know where this video is 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.640
 So I'm up and I'll go if 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.410
 He took time to record it and to return 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.420
 to upload it again or if I will not try 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.010
 upload another look but good to forgive me 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.840
 for not uploading it but it's not what 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.700
 I do not know where I put it because 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.830
 As I told you I had not recorded but I do not know 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.380
 where I kept it so I'm sorry 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.390
 and soon you will have an outfit
