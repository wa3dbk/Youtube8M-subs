in this GoPro tips and tricks video

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.930 
in this GoPro tips and tricks video
we're<00:00:07.330> gonna<00:00:07.420> be<00:00:07.559> unboxing<00:00:08.559> the<00:00:08.889> polar<00:00:09.340> pro

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
we're gonna be unboxing the polar pro

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.109 
we're gonna be unboxing the polar pro
neutral<00:00:10.660> density<00:00:11.640> filters<00:00:12.640> so<00:00:13.630> these<00:00:14.410> are

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.119 
neutral density filters so these are

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.279 
neutral density filters so these are
very<00:00:16.119> cruel<00:00:16.390> neutral<00:00:16.630> density<00:00:16.750> filters<00:00:17.140> and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
very cruel neutral density filters and

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.089 
very cruel neutral density filters and
they're<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> little<00:00:17.529> bit<00:00:17.710> different<00:00:17.740> than<00:00:18.039> the

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
they're a little bit different than the

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.790 
they're a little bit different than the
ones<00:00:18.250> we<00:00:18.369> looked<00:00:18.550> at<00:00:18.670> before<00:00:18.789> on<00:00:19.450> this<00:00:20.380> site<00:00:20.650> if

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
ones we looked at before on this site if

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.600 
ones we looked at before on this site if
you<00:00:20.860> go<00:00:20.920> check<00:00:21.130> out<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.280> video<00:00:21.430> description

density<00:00:24.730> filters<00:00:25.150> for<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.449> hero3<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.890> ones

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
density filters for the hero3 these ones

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.200 
density filters for the hero3 these ones
are<00:00:27.520> for<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.789> hero<00:00:28.090> 3<00:00:28.300> or<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.900> hero<00:00:29.170> 3<00:00:29.380> plus

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
are for the hero 3 or the hero 3 plus

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.880 
are for the hero 3 or the hero 3 plus
when<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.359> in<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.990> frame<00:00:32.349> so<00:00:32.590> these<00:00:32.710> actually

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
when it's in the frame so these actually

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.630 
when it's in the frame so these actually
just<00:00:33.070> push<00:00:33.430> right<00:00:33.850> on<00:00:34.090> top<00:00:34.570> of<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:34.960> lens

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
just push right on top of the lens

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.829 
just push right on top of the lens
instead<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.729> clipping<00:00:36.940> on<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.449> waterproof

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
instead of clipping on to the waterproof

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.860 
instead of clipping on to the waterproof
housing<00:00:38.019> this<00:00:38.319> is<00:00:38.530> really<00:00:39.269> really<00:00:40.269> cool<00:00:40.539> if

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
housing this is really really cool if

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.569 
housing this is really really cool if
you're<00:00:41.050> gonna<00:00:41.319> be<00:00:41.530> flying<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.039> airplane<00:00:42.460> your

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
you're gonna be flying the airplane your

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.549 
you're gonna be flying the airplane your
kill<00:00:42.729> pro<00:00:43.030> on<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.269> drone<00:00:43.600> say<00:00:44.139> something<00:00:44.469> like

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
kill pro on a drone say something like

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.119 
kill pro on a drone say something like
the<00:00:44.739> DJI<00:00:45.129> phantom<00:00:45.699> because<00:00:46.629> what<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.499> means<00:00:47.799> is

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
the DJI phantom because what it means is

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.160 
the DJI phantom because what it means is
by<00:00:48.399> giving<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.269> neutral<00:00:49.659> density<00:00:49.690> filter

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
by giving the neutral density filter

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.349 
by giving the neutral density filter
lengthens<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.219> shutter<00:00:51.579> speed<00:00:51.909> so<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.179> gives

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
lengthens the shutter speed so it gives

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.989 
lengthens the shutter speed so it gives
you<00:00:52.479> a<00:00:52.510> longer<00:00:52.859> shutter<00:00:53.859> speed<00:00:54.249> and<00:00:54.489> what<00:00:54.789> that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
you a longer shutter speed and what that

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.329 
you a longer shutter speed and what that
does<00:00:55.209> it<00:00:55.420> gets<00:00:55.690> rid<00:00:55.959> of<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.440> jello<00:00:56.859> effect

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
does it gets rid of the jello effect

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.479 
does it gets rid of the jello effect
that's<00:00:57.579> very<00:00:57.999> common<00:00:58.600> with<00:00:58.809> drones<00:00:59.679> so<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.309> you

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
that's very common with drones so if you

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.280 
that's very common with drones so if you
don't<00:01:00.699> have<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.600> really<00:01:02.589> good<00:01:04.290> stabilization

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
don't have a really good stabilization

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.290 
don't have a really good stabilization
system<00:01:05.770> for<00:01:05.979> your<00:01:06.100> drone<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.909> may<00:01:07.030> get<00:01:07.180> that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
system for your drone you may get that

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.510 
system for your drone you may get that
jello<00:01:07.600> effect<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.890> some<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.220> rotor

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
jello effect because some of that rotor

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.430 
jello effect because some of that rotor
motions<00:01:10.450> being<00:01:10.630> transmitted<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.050> your<00:01:11.170> camera

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
motions being transmitted to your camera

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.570 
motions being transmitted to your camera
and<00:01:11.590> putting<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.070> these<00:01:12.160> neutral<00:01:12.430> density

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
and putting one of these neutral density

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.830 
and putting one of these neutral density
filters<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.510> your<00:01:13.570> GoPro<00:01:14.560> will<00:01:15.250> solve<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:15.940> if

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
filters on your GoPro will solve that if

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.660 
filters on your GoPro will solve that if
you<00:01:17.020> want<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.230> see<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.650> video<00:01:17.980> where<00:01:18.520> they

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
you want to see the video where they

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.980 
you want to see the video where they
show<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.000> off<00:01:19.120> you<00:01:19.270> can<00:01:19.390> check<00:01:19.540> out<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.810> link

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
show that off you can check out the link

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.780 
show that off you can check out the link
in<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.170> description<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.860> their<00:01:21.010> tests<00:01:21.430> with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
in the description to their tests with

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.390 
in the description to their tests with
this<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.300> effete<00:01:22.750> on<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> drone<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.250> then

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
this on effete on a drone and then

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.370 
this on effete on a drone and then
without<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.270> quite<00:01:25.540> amazing<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
without it and it's quite amazing the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.810 
without it and it's quite amazing the
difference<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:28.330> ahead<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.630> open<00:01:28.900> this<00:01:28.990> up<00:01:29.140> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
difference go ahead and open this up and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.430 
difference go ahead and open this up and
there<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:32.110> filter<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.600> also<00:01:34.720> give<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.410> a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
there is the filter it also give you a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.100 
there is the filter it also give you a
little<00:01:35.800> plastic<00:01:36.220> bag<00:01:38.460> alright<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.580> little

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
little plastic bag alright a little

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.290 
little plastic bag alright a little
microfiber<00:01:41.110> cloth<00:01:41.470> bag<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:42.640> keep<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> filter

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
microfiber cloth bag to keep the filter

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.050 
microfiber cloth bag to keep the filter
in<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.630> keep<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.050> from<00:01:44.260> getting<00:01:44.320> scratched

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
in and keep it from getting scratched

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.399 
in and keep it from getting scratched
one<00:01:46.060> thing<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.300> note<00:01:46.450> here<00:01:46.480> guys<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:47.020> these<00:01:47.200> are

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
one thing to note here guys is these are

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.680 
one thing to note here guys is these are
glass<00:01:48.190> filters<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.480> they<00:01:49.630> are<00:01:49.840> pretty<00:01:50.590> fragile

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
glass filters so they are pretty fragile

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.210 
glass filters so they are pretty fragile
don't<00:01:52.690> treat<00:01:53.110> them<00:01:53.350> like<00:01:53.380> your<00:01:53.770> rest<00:01:53.980> of<00:01:54.070> your

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
don't treat them like your rest of your

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.530 
don't treat them like your rest of your
GoPro<00:01:54.520> stuff<00:01:54.730> or<00:01:54.940> he's<00:01:55.060> kind<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.240> throw<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.450> in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
GoPro stuff or he's kind of throw it in

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.960 
GoPro stuff or he's kind of throw it in
your<00:01:55.630> bag<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.280> hope<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.520> doesn't<00:01:57.820> break

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
your bag and hope that doesn't break

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.190 
your bag and hope that doesn't break
because<00:01:58.120> most<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.600> GoPro<00:01:58.810> stuff<00:01:59.020> is

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
because most of the GoPro stuff is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070 
because most of the GoPro stuff is
pretty<00:01:59.470> indestructible<00:02:00.070> these<00:02:00.490> are<00:02:01.080> high

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
pretty indestructible these are high
