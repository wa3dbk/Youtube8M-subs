Mike what he means to do is be careful
of<00:01:43.460> his<00:01:43.580> speed<00:01:43.910> control<00:01:44.360> got<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.080> little<00:01:45.260> bit

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
of his speed control got a little bit

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.110 
of his speed control got a little bit
fast<00:01:45.770> his<00:01:46.070> last<00:01:46.250> couple<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.670> shots<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.060> the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120

get<00:01:49.310> back<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.610> pocket<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.120> i<00:01:50.150> think<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.660> fall

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
get back to pocket so i think this fall

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.560 
get back to pocket so i think this fall
will<00:01:50.990> be<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.110> little<00:01:51.320> bit<00:01:51.500> slower<00:01:55.150> was<00:01:56.150> but<00:01:56.479> it

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
will be a little bit slower was but it

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.330 
will be a little bit slower was but it
left<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> tempting<00:01:57.229> well<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.619> very<00:01:57.890> good<00:01:58.100> shot

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
left the tempting well a very good shot

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.920 
left the tempting well a very good shot
for<00:01:58.580> Normie<00:01:58.850> sorta<00:01:59.060> shakes<00:01:59.330> his<00:01:59.479> head<00:01:59.660> thought

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
for Normie sorta shakes his head thought

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.010 
for Normie sorta shakes his head thought

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
that would take care of the 10 pin but

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.359 
that would take care of the 10 pin but
Lisa's<00:02:03.020> back<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.560> pocket<00:02:06.130> we'll<00:02:07.130> take<00:02:07.310> a

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369
