 i

 i 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.440
 welcome and welcome to the gei channel 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.570
 My point today is Miguel GÃ¡lvez and today 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.309
 we come with a new boxing and its 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.500
 corresponding analysis of a 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.770
 pc component in this case we have a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.099
 knox brand sink the 300 h 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.529
 the hammer series of nox this 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.480
 heatsink comes equipped with a fan 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.699
 12 centimeters 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.070
 what produces a sound level of 21 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.410
 decibels and a power of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.570
 cooling the heatsink of course 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 135 Watt 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.050
 here will go the features 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.220
 dissipator techniques in the part 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 back of the box 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.000
 forgiveness on one side and the back 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.000
 the assembly instructions 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 good view the box we are going to take out what 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.130
 inside we practice the lid 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.130
 higher 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 because not victory 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.000
 and the first thing with what we are 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.370
 is with the assembly manual and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 very good heatsink characteristics 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.340
 similar because they came in laxe 100 that what 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.340
 we analyzed recently 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 Here is a part of the support 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 anchor to install the motherboard 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.859
 and these two wires and you are that then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.859
 we will say to visible 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.229
 here we have the syringe with the paste 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.800
 thermal for the installation of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.800
 heatsink 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.590
 and the other part of the mounting system 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.539
 this all this we're going to really 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.539
 interesting that is our heatsink 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.180
 As you can see it has a pretty design 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.190
 attractive and here we have the two at 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.190
 brecitos the three that before 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.560
 the riveted wiring the nylon with 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.560
 extreme fields a rubber protection 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.390
 and fan with protection too 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.120
 silicone to prevent vibrations and its 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.819
 corresponding noise 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 and here we see the emblem top 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.260
 from the hammer series 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.010
 and what I had told you all at 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.010
 little man are 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.920
 in case you want putting it like this 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.990
 another fan thus increasing the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.420
 cooling power and the flow of 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.420
 air through the response radiator 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.210
 well I've seen all this let's go 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.579
 well this is the base and we will move on to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.860
 see it in more detail here we have the 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.470
 total fan of 12 centimeters that 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.450
 we said with the silicone cover 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.170
 to make it quieter and that we 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.330
 transmit vibration 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.330
 the base to connect the cpu 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.350
 the top hummer emblem of the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.350
 nox hammer series the three people 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.350
 double 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.480
 and in the back we see the radiator 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.519
 of aluminum 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.099
 as I said before as it is usually 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.409
 I leave the analysis link in the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.840
 description of the video you already know that 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.940
 you can leave a like comments so much 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.330
 on youtube as in the post of analysis 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.299
 and I hope to have soon by 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.379
 here both on the channel and on the web 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.860
 I leave you with a plan of all the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.019
 content of the box and I say goodbye and the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.829
 gÃ¡lvez so that my point is many 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.829
 thanks and best regards
