00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello to all youtube eros good here you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.950
 I bring a video of the home page 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.620
 and you know well the pv refers to not 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.420
 understand too much 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.950
 let's see everyone you know how to record 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.020
 playstation3 and if you do not know 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.820
 there are many tutorials go to look for 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.009
 there this video is to show you 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.900
 record play station2 that there is none 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.000
 or at least in Spanish to none 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.099
 because I was killing myself to look for it and I had 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.860
 I discover it for myself or my to 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.570
 see this cable here good here are 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.399
 with battery power this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.070
 cable is the computer that you can 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.920
 see there worth is this here and then 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.380
 there is the stack of components the top one 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.660
 goes to the consoles and the one below goes to the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.060
 TV 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.630
 we'll see 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:55.420
 the bottom row clear that is the TV 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.460
 this is from here it's worth these three 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.070
 someone's cables and you just have to 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.830
 worry about how you can know which 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.160
 it is this very easy, it is the same 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.890
 the same entry and exit as the 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.850
 colors white and yellow red 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 play 2 and play 3 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.780
 so then you have to do 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.630
 when you have the play 2 in front 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.840
 yours with the red cable 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 Once you get the white and yellow commanded 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.800
 dais to system configuration 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 we give him 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.120
 in configuring in controlling the age in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
 system configuration you will see that you 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.590
 it puts rgv surely you have it in the rgp 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.040
 and you have to change it to what it says 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.480
 here next 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.220
 you give him and we give him back is worth 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.720
 is changed that was the fundamental thing that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.680
 you had to do after this that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.350
 you have to do 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.479
 you come here behind the play 2 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.480
 you remove the only cable that you have to 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.630
 have that is the one with the yellow red and 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.910
 and white that is plugged behind the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.240
 console and as the component cables already 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.880
 are plugged into the TV you only have 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.720
 that change this cable here this from 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.039
 here that is the one that is connected to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.050
 to the console 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.180
 then we have here 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.180
 we plugged it in quietly 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.500
 is already plugged in and now we take the 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.860
 command we change the port of the ub to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.410
 components 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.540
 and so much tachÃ¡n on TV at least 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.910
 you see now they see the problem that people 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 it will say but it can be aggravated or it can not be 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.300
 record balls what interests me 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.200
 it is clear that you can record for that 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.370
 I'm going to give you to capture 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.370
 we are going to capture him 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.020
 and you can see how it looks here and in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.740
 TV is also seen in both and god 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.740
 let's see 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.390
 You see moves and sounds 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.750
 to see the volume at full 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.810
 if not the knives you hear 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.209
 or not 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.819
 I'll do the show as if it 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.890
 it is recorded I can do the demonstration with 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.300
 this same because so that it does not lengthen 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.520
 a lot of the video but my channel is good 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.000
 videos of the play 2 so if 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.470
 you are interested in seeing the quality of the graphic 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.150
 you just have to get to me 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.209
 channel and look for the games that go up 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.209
 play 2 and if still not up none 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.209
 well 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 I say subscribe, it's me that you make me a 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.379
 please, so it's worth four nonsense 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.590
 from the buttons and we're going to stop the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.359
 video is worth we give to turn off the TV 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 keep watching and I 've told you it looks 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.859

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.060
 tele and will be recording calm 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:56.110
 so it has come here with the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.750
 other videos we give 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.750
 we enlarge the image we give to the play 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.519
 as you can see yes it has been recorded 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.519
