little video showing you how to make a
halter<00:00:04.259> there's<00:00:05.220> two<00:00:05.460> different<00:00:05.640> kinds<00:00:05.910> of

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
halter there's two different kinds of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.410 
halter there's two different kinds of
halters<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.960> first<00:00:07.230> kind<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.910> original

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
halters the first kind is the original

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
loop it under this channel right way

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.470 
loop it under this channel right way
it's<00:00:29.380> kind<00:00:29.620> of<00:00:29.650> weird<00:00:29.860> cuz<00:00:30.070> pop<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:30.490> worst<00:00:30.730> it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
just looks like this so in order to make

business take a little bit of string let

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.520 
business take a little bit of string let
it<00:00:46.720> out<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:48.250> see<00:00:48.460> how<00:00:48.580> this<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.790> coming<00:00:49.059> apart

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it out make see how this is coming apart

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.290 
it out make see how this is coming apart
that<00:00:50.530> won't<00:00:50.830> be<00:00:50.920> helpful<00:00:51.489> later<00:00:51.520> on<00:00:52.000> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
that won't be helpful later on and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.280 
that won't be helpful later on and
making<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.960> halter<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.460> just<00:00:54.820> tie<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.660> little

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
making the halter so I just tie a little

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.690 
making the halter so I just tie a little
tiny<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:57.730> there<00:00:58.239> and<00:01:01.380> hope<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.710> then<00:01:03.370> it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
tiny not there and hope and then it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.260 
tiny not there and hope and then it
won't<00:01:03.910> unravel<00:01:04.119> anymore<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.400> cut<00:01:06.700> not<00:01:06.970> too

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
won't unravel anymore and I cut not too

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.090 
won't unravel anymore and I cut not too
much<00:01:07.479> not<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:09.369> little<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.960> about<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:11.830> much

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
much not too little so about this much

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.320 
much not too little so about this much
is<00:01:12.250> good<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.220> do<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.520> same<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:16.000> tie<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> knot

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
is good and I do the same and tie a knot

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
is good and I do the same and tie a knot
in<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.020> end<00:01:17.259> too

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.139 

and<00:01:23.969> now<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.290> started<00:01:26.090> tell<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
and now we can get started tell the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.359 
and now we can get started tell the
horse<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.469> safe<00:01:28.740> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
horse so that you can see it's safe but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.569 
horse so that you can see it's safe but
not<00:01:29.700> completely<00:01:30.149> like<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> it'll<00:01:31.049> mess<00:01:31.200> up

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
not completely like this it'll mess up

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.110 
not completely like this it'll mess up
so<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.970> about<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:35.000> loop<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.180> over<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.710> chin

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
so just about this loop it over the chin

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.399 
so just about this loop it over the chin
cross<00:01:40.120> over<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.690> strings

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.899 

and<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.710> behind<00:01:46.860> ears

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
and go behind ears

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.529 
and go behind ears
is<00:01:49.240> high<00:01:49.509> enough<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.909> want<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.210> halter

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
is high enough I don't want the halter

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.510 
is high enough I don't want the halter
too<00:01:52.689> loose<00:01:52.929> or<00:01:53.200> too<00:01:53.289> tight<00:01:53.469> because<00:01:54.039> you<00:01:54.310> want

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
too loose or too tight because you want

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.849 
too loose or too tight because you want
it<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.759> be<00:01:54.999> able<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.569> slip<00:01:55.810> on<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.350> off<00:01:56.469> of<00:01:56.710> this

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
it to be able to slip on and off of this

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.580 
it to be able to slip on and off of this
horse<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.789> other<00:01:58.420> horses<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.869> just<00:02:02.229> doubled

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
horse and other horses and just doubled

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.389 
horse and other horses and just doubled
on<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.799> like<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:04.859> just<00:02:05.859> cut<00:02:06.130> off<00:02:06.219> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
on it like that I just cut off the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.890 
on it like that I just cut off the
extras

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.570 

and<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.980> flips<00:02:13.430> off<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:15.580> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
and it flips off just like that and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.759 
and it flips off just like that and
there<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.239> have<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:18.129> put<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.680> have

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769

there you have it put it on all you have
to<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.150> take<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> little<00:02:23.390> piece<00:02:23.690> it's<00:02:24.440> almost

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
to do take a little piece it's almost

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710 
to do take a little piece it's almost
like<00:02:25.069> you're<00:02:25.459> ranking<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.569> you're

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
like you're ranking with like you're

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.009 
like you're ranking with like you're
making<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.829> you<00:02:28.040> don't<00:02:28.329> cross<00:02:29.329> it<00:02:29.360> over<00:02:29.629> as

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
making it but you don't cross it over as

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.830 
making it but you don't cross it over as
we<00:02:30.170> did<00:02:30.319> before<00:02:30.349> but<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.459> take<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.940> flip<00:02:32.690> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
we did before but then take this flip it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.100 
we did before but then take this flip it
over<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.349> put<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.069> behind<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:34.840> hope<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
over and put it behind here hope that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.760 
over and put it behind here hope that
helps<00:02:36.440> you
