 effectively anxious and anxious are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 these candidates that we had the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.520
 opportunity to share with many 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 country but for several of them the task 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 to get to this point has not been 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.640
 easy two of them are my panama and my 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.640
 Argentina here a little of its history 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.070
 behind the glamor the smiles and 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.780
 suits of lights from the same universe 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.719
 there are stories of sacrifice and commitment 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.189
 of dreamers like miss panama and mass 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.320
 Argentina that despite the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.930
 difficulties have insisted on 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.549
 represent your country in style 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.869
 I think a lot of people would like 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.840
 to be living what I am living 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.430
 and that's why I want to give my maximum and show 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 to people what I always say yes 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.110
 you can and yes you could 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.390
 Valentina Ferrer was crowned in the reign 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.460
 of miss argentina with responsibility 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.679
 of traveling to the universal contest of the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.100
 beauty but without the necessary support 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.840
 of your organization I do not say it is like 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 criticism of my country far from it and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.350
 please I want to represent the best 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.789
 form and really show what are the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.190
 Argentines but I found myself alone and that 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.960
 fight and that preparation I had to 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.470
 have was very difficult 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.330
 miss panama me max and hollywood is 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.580
 fanatic of the target shooting and the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.159
 policy is willing to take the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.440
 title of the most beautiful woman 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.180
 challenges of his reign began from 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.509
 the day he decided to compete for the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.540
 crown of your country facing strong 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.479
 reviews I was not one of the favorites 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.380
 and enter between the six then and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.820
 then win that but if from where 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.040
 where because they did not see but then not 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.470
 they realize that how are the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 girls really but she's clear 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 the reason that prevents many countries 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.920
 of Latin America win the miss crown 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.790
 universe or what he believes is that he does 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.460
 more needed to be able to have more queens or 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.900
 miss universes 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.180
 it is support that not luckily for my 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.140
 argentina appeared those who herself 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.540
 call this group of Venezuelans 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.420
 composed of professor of oratory 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 makeup designer catwalk and up 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.430
 canvas representative will see his dream of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.280
 become miss universe is realized 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.010
 it's true that these two women already 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.010
 they are worthy winners representing 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.410
 the fighter woman who breaks schemes and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.410
 that magnifies itself before obstacles
