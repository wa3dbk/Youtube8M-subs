00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.980
 hello guys hello guys today 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.690
 I want to reply too, I have everything 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.820
 what happened here on the tube of 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.310
 Recently later precisely an output 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.710
 I would be unhappy about someone 's boyfriend 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.439
 youtuber just very famous here on the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.480
 tube I tell you that I these two youtuber 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.310
 so I follow them two youtuber not this one 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.890
 youtuber follow her and her boyfriend 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.589
 that I would like to emphasize that he in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 reality is a bit the shadow in my opinion of her 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.909
 in spite of charity he did not do me 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.329
 nothing bad indeed I follow their videos 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:37.430
 more out of curiosity to see how far 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.810
 they push themselves rather than in short for 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.580
 besides because then in short theirs 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.300
 content 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.320
 that is, what content they have 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.450
 show what you do there to do the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.040
 shopping etc. there can be a video of the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.270
 genre but when it starts to do it all 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.210
 days seasons with the same things 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.740
 etc. a person in my opinion gets tired 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.890
 plus you can tell by what you do it 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.370
 just for my interest, of course 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.930
 anyway 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
 the other thing that makes me think that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.950
 actually these things are done 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.710
 more for interest than for real 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.619
 passion is the answer given later 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.689
 then to the accusations that nadia maria tempest 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.549
 has raised about the joke 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.280
 unhappy that now in fact just there 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.039
 I'll say just why this thing goes to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.560
 answer go and answer that it was one 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.170
 beaten and who thanks being 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.439
 reached 15 thousand subscribers to 15 thousand 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.750
 followers some pure presumption that is 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.569
 you answer a criticism he says later 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.000
 green is like saying that I don't care so much 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.520
 I 15 thousand people who follow me 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.429
 what the fuck do I care 6 15 thousand people 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.270
 who follow you I have three thousand and 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.340
 maybe 2,900 hate me I don't know but who 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 cares i mean i'm not going to say 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.799
 to make unhappy jokes and about people who 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.780
 not even know or to wish and then to 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.610
 deny that he wished death a 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.500
 certain people just because they 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.119
 they did it with teo with yours 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.149
 girlfriend when you are you 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.049
 decided to expose your kiss is as if 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.700
 me and like i just wanted comments 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.380
 positive under my videos that I have 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.380
 very few subscribers I mean ie not 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.970
 is that all of you are great inscriptions ed 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.480
 indeed, we too are arriving 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.160
 critical 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 I always try to answer with the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.389
 smile to throw it on the laugh do not know 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.599
 maybe I change a person's mind 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:29.349
 but I mean as much as you can 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.130
 say why I do n't like races you 're ugly 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.500
 and an ugly nose what you want 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 I sincerely don't come to wish you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.200
 death even if you wish me death 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.609
 precisely because I don't know why 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.190
 youtube is not real life 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.989
 there is so much more then it was said 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.569
 much more comes from them also behind them 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.239
 youtube that even themselves 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.950
 they probably don't show but how 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.569
 there is so much more than positive there is also 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.169
 much more negative in my opinion is 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.130
 much more than a1 there is so much more 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.710
 not 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.920
 in the light of the sun in my opinion to each 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.100
 so a person who does this sort of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.470
 joke or I'd like to organize 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420
 a trip to chernobyl with all the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.140
 haters all those people there 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.810
 they hate only me and mine to come back 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.650
 little stars I and my fiancÃ©e a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.710
 makes me think that a kind of of 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.200
 veiling ie in a veiled and non-veiled manner 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.480
 we say so with direct on wishes 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.980
 however someone died who later came to me 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.780
 to say no, however, I did not wish 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.750
 wished no one death 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 now it's not like we're all stupid though 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.230
 one says such a thing comes back not 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.870
 only two start at 20 and come back alone 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.090
 the 2 what it means that the other thing 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.840
 they do remain the ones playing vamo 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.520
 no dolls there is definitely bad things 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.290
 wish me otherwise you did not wish to go to 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.850
 chernobyl no that you wouldn't have 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.560
 organized a trip to chernobyl 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.110
 would have wished I have decided to say of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.640
 to face a journey to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.720
 disneyland i know i mean i mean of 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.780
 What are we talking about 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.970
 anyway i don't know not 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.430
 I don't like this thing what I mean 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.549
 however, I wanted to tell you how 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.690
 I think above all because in my opinion it is 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.580
 at this point I repeat it is not 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.480
 more a thing a matter of passion 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.400
 to show to talk about products 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.610
 so spontaneously etc. but it is 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.430
 really just a matter of 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.260
 interest fundamentally this certain 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.090
 is that everyone does what he wants ie 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.250
 until however they are not affected 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 other people or at least not happen 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.580
 facts like this I would not miss 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.840
 the story said sincerely 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.490
 however, given that it is not 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.740
 I find a correct thing I wanted too 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.210
 say say my everything here here then 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.220
 I repeat, everyone is free to do that 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.460
 who wants to follow whoever wants too 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.320
 he follows them again but not not 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.000
 approve certain things account here 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.240
 I close here now I do not remember if I had 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.150
 other to say 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.560
 well so this is a little bit how much 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.599
 don't let me know what you do 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.530
 think 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.800
 obviously here there is also to say this 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.360
 what when you have so many 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.460
 registered so many people among 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.289
 Quotation marks that follow you is easy 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.690
 actually fall then be 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.069
 judged is absolutely happened to 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.389
 they could happen to me could 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.960
 happen to anyone even if I do 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.860
 I repeat, I don't have so many so many 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.680
 people following me 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.210
 but then not to admit then the error la 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.310
 slip that was made in my opinion 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.750
 actually implies and makes us understand 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.770
 how certain people really are 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.620
 they live in a world of their own 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.090
 and here I close girls I send you a 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.979
 let me know what you kiss 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.319
 think i hope i've told you everything about 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.090
 having made me understand why not 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.440
 it was definitely a scheduled video 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.680
 and see you next time 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.680
 Hello
