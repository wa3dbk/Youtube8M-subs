mean the facilities here are fantastic
it<00:00:23.630> was<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.050> bit<00:00:24.200> of<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.410> was<00:00:25.010> a<00:00:25.040> bit<00:00:25.190> of<00:00:25.280> a

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
it was a bit of a was a bit of a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.120 
it was a bit of a was a bit of a
no-brainer<00:00:25.730> for<00:00:25.910> me<00:00:26.120> so<00:00:26.590> it<00:00:27.590> kind<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.890> had<00:00:28.010> to

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
no-brainer for me so it kind of had to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.299

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
be Muslim chance I think it's really

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.190 
be Muslim chance I think it's really
important<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.850> sort<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.210> go<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.960> placement

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
put together very very well I don't know

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.460 
put together very very well I don't know
well<00:02:32.890> structured<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.690> with<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.989> clarity

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
well structured and and with the clarity

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.750 
well structured and and with the clarity
to<00:02:35.530> most<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.950> them<00:02:36.040> which<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.640> really

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to most of them which is really really

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.380 
to most of them which is really really
good<00:02:38.610> unfortunate<00:02:39.610> enough<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.820> begin<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.270> die

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
good unfortunate enough to begin to die

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.520 
good unfortunate enough to begin to die
so<00:02:40.600> not<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.050> not<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.260> trend<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:43.260> course<00:02:44.260> it's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so not really not a trend of course it's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
so not really not a trend of course it's
just<00:02:44.590> been<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.550> good<00:02:46.030> they've

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just been really really good they've

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.570 
just been really really good they've
kind<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> pushed<00:02:46.989> pushed<00:02:47.680> me<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.519> think

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
kind of pushed pushed me and I think

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.240 
kind of pushed pushed me and I think
that's<00:02:48.880> that's<00:02:49.300> ultimately<00:02:49.750> what's<00:02:50.650> kept<00:02:51.160> my

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that's that's ultimately what's kept my

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.830 
that's that's ultimately what's kept my
work<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.670> really<00:02:51.850> high<00:02:52.060> standard

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
work so really high standard

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.259 
work so really high standard
I'm<00:02:52.989> sad<00:02:53.260> I'm<00:02:53.500> sad<00:02:53.709> really<00:02:54.070> it's<00:02:54.880> gone<00:02:55.030> really
