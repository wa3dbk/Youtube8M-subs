00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.120
 what a carnal fart they are 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.589
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.999
 video I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:14.119
 put a helicopter attack inside 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.369
 your garage like that is inside your garage 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.439
 let's put this little helicopter 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.390
 that is very very chunky for you 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.119
 Take pictures like the ones I 'm taking 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.810
 me so that you presume it to your friends 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.070
 ok the trick is very complicated but 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.109
 I'm going to explain, let's start with 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.150
 the tutorial the first thing that you have to 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.920
 obviously doing is getting one of 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.100
 you will find these helicopters 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.410
 you usually find it here not here 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.270
 in this location you always find one 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.440
 of these helicopters or simply 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.570
 call pegasus and if he brings it to you if 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.489
 You have bought it as a result or you're going to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.679
 give the location of this helicopter 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.960
 then you have to come to this part of the 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.100
 map here is the sea that we are going to 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.989
 put inside a building like that is 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.079
 inside a building let's do this 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.600
 little trick ok channels this trick is 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.479
 well very complicated is your 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.180
 it's hard to do so is that if you 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.940
 do you take a picture send me the because 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 the truth is well fucking complicated ok 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.020
 what we are going to do as you can see 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.810
 very slowly we will be flying very 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
 slowly let's fly here and we're going 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 to put here inside this little bit 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.200
 as of this space between the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.719
 building and what we are going to do 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 just as you can see is to be in 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.429
 the middle and we will try as you can 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.590
 see the camera it looks like it's like 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.380
 played then let's fly up 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.630
 suddenly you suddenly fly towards 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 up and as you can see then you can 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.469
 fly inside what has been this 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.270
 building now we're going to go to the part 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.799
 from the center with a lot of attention here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.649
 because it is also very complicated 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.450
 get in the center part of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.860
 building and as you can see you are going to fly 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.890
 down and suddenly because like 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.679
 you can see you are outside the map we are 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.470
 flying out of what is the map of 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.810
 gta ok every time you can see everything towards 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 up people cars of all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.260
 buildings the houses you can see everything 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.870
 down here we are practically 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.810
 flying below the gta map now what 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.820
 what we are going to do is go to this location 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.280
 this is the most important location 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.950
 you have to get to this location here 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.780
 exactly where is this activity and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.570
 what we are going to do when we arrive in 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.640
 is this location what we are going to 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.240
 to do is simply to go around 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.550
 be flying see the minimap we are going to 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.930
 be flying in the activity and suddenly 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.340
 like we're going to give it down 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.110
 down down down 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.660
 little by little little by little 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.130
 spinning around and suddenly as you can 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.540
 watch 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.250
 I am already inside this garage and I got 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.390
 what the helicopter has been 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.510
 this garage 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.790
 so it's carnal and here's a little 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.610
 trick also or sometimes it appears in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.280
 this house in this house is not mine 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.070
 obviously sometimes they appear here or 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.230
 sometimes it appears inside your garage I 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.850
 appeared I did this trick twice and 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.360
 the first time it appears inside of me 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.710
 garage but like that as it is very 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.510
 on the shore and I'm going to teach you 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.060
 I was very on the shore and suddenly the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.000
 I find it disappeared as they can 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.100
 see inside my garage I also got 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.810
 to the bar at the time I got off you I got off 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.390
 on the wrong side and the elect left 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.910
 but but as you can see then here 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.750
 we are again the trick is really cool 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.670
 if you want to do it and louis and if you could 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.050
 do it just send me a picture myself 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.390
 I'll put it there on the page of the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.340
 facebook to see that you see little 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.440
 mother you can invite your friends 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.590
 presume you have a helicopter 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.270
 inside your garage the helicopter does not 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.630
 you can save once I tell you I do not know 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.630
 you can save 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.159
 if you leave this garage 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.349
 automatically the helicopter 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.489
 disappears but good nice me with 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.140
