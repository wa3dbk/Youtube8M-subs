we<00:00:05.640> begin<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> series<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.779> measurements

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
we begin with a series of measurements

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.870 
we begin with a series of measurements
to<00:00:07.470> make<00:00:07.620> sure<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.130> tub<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.490> able<00:00:08.760> to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
to make sure that the tub is able to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.470 
to make sure that the tub is able to
undergo<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.510> conversion<00:00:11.300> after<00:00:12.300> we've

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
undergo the conversion after we've

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.270 
undergo the conversion after we've
determined<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> tub<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.440> able<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> undergo

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
determined the tub is able to undergo

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010 
determined the tub is able to undergo
the<00:00:14.429> conversion<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.120> begin<00:00:15.360> our<00:00:15.389> measurements

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the conversion we begin our measurements

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:29.870 
the conversion we begin our measurements
in<00:00:16.170> marking<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> tub

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.910 

we<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:30.510> templates<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.200> mark<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.530> tub<00:00:31.740> for

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
we use templates to mark the tub for

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.460 
we use templates to mark the tub for
cutting<00:00:35.240> then<00:00:36.240> we<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> caliper<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.290> mark

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
cutting then we use a caliper to mark

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.200 
cutting then we use a caliper to mark
the<00:00:37.590> flat<00:00:37.830> tub<00:00:38.100> floor<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:38.850> sure<00:00:39.060> it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the flat tub floor to make sure it's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
the flat tub floor to make sure it's
parallel<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> outside<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.470> tub

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
parallel with the outside of the tub

00:00:40.620 --> 00:01:07.600 
parallel with the outside of the tub
wall

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.250 

the<00:01:08.610> sections<00:01:09.060> cut<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.720> removed<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the sections cut out and removed for the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.990 
the sections cut out and removed for the
tub

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.580 

then<00:01:19.780> we<00:01:19.960> prepare<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.470> top<00:01:20.680> wall<00:01:20.890> end<00:01:21.130> plugs

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
then we prepare the top wall end plugs

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.380 
then we prepare the top wall end plugs
we<00:01:23.590> trace<00:01:23.830> each<00:01:24.010> tub<00:01:24.310> contour<00:01:24.820> onto<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.150> two

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
we trace each tub contour onto a two

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.150 
we trace each tub contour onto a two
inch<00:01:25.570> thick<00:01:25.630> block<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.350> cut<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.620> contour<00:01:27.010> out

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
inch thick block and cut the contour out

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.310 
inch thick block and cut the contour out
grating<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.880> floods

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.360 

next<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:32.410> place<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.770> end<00:01:32.920> plugs<00:01:33.160> into

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
next we place the end plugs into

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:41.310 
next we place the end plugs into
position<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.150> secure<00:01:34.210> them<00:01:34.690> into<00:01:34.810> place<00:01:40.320> now

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
position and secure them into place now

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
position and secure them into place now
we<00:01:41.380> begin<00:01:41.650> measuring<00:01:41.979> our<00:01:42.310> end<00:01:42.490> caps<00:01:44.160> we<00:01:45.160> use<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
we begin measuring our end caps we use a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.040 
we begin measuring our end caps we use a
special<00:01:45.700> marking<00:01:46.210> tool<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.600> mark<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.930> end

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
special marking tool to mark the end

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.880 
special marking tool to mark the end
caps<00:01:47.320> half<00:01:47.680> an<00:01:47.860> inch<00:01:48.010> proud<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.490> tub<00:01:48.700> wall

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
caps half an inch proud of the tub wall

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.290 
caps half an inch proud of the tub wall
then<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.009> cut<00:01:51.190> out<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.340> end<00:01:51.580> caps<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:58.119> use<00:01:58.270> a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
then we cut out the end caps we use a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.389 
then we cut out the end caps we use a
router<00:01:58.600> with<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.930> 3/8<00:01:59.410> round<00:01:59.710> over<00:01:59.950> bit<00:01:59.979> to

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
router with a 3/8 round over bit to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.830 
router with a 3/8 round over bit to
finish<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> end<00:02:00.940> caps<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> smooth

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
finish the end caps with a smooth

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.440 
finish the end caps with a smooth
rounded<00:02:02.500> finish<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.759> secure<00:02:07.090> them<00:02:07.210> into

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
rounded finish then we secure them into

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
rounded finish then we secure them into
our<00:02:07.479> end<00:02:07.750> plugs<00:02:16.050> next<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.170> cut<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> support<00:02:17.770> for

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
our end plugs next we cut a support for

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.570 
our end plugs next we cut a support for
a<00:02:18.040> threshold

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
a threshold

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
a threshold
we<00:02:20.330> use<00:02:20.480> our<00:02:20.600> ramp<00:02:20.840> sample<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.320> figure<00:02:21.560> out<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
we use our ramp sample to figure out the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.740 
we use our ramp sample to figure out the
location<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.490> threshold<00:02:22.880> support<00:02:23.450> needs<00:02:23.660> to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
location that threshold support needs to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:38.020 
location that threshold support needs to
be<00:02:23.840> secured

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300 

once<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.050> determined<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:39.920> screw<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
once that is determined we screw the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.450 
once that is determined we screw the
sport<00:02:40.640> into<00:02:40.790> place

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.160 

using<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.580> ramp<00:02:44.760> guide<00:02:44.970> again<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.720> determine

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
using the ramp guide again we determine

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:55.830 
using the ramp guide again we determine
the<00:02:46.230> remaining<00:02:46.470> threshold<00:02:47.070> support<00:02:47.430> guides

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.140 

finally<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:57.040> caulk<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.489> set<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.819> non-skid

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
finally we caulk the set the non-skid

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.440 
finally we caulk the set the non-skid
threshold<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:03.130> appear<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.849> our<00:03:03.970> support

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.280 

finally<00:03:13.819> we<00:03:13.970> clean<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.390> caulk<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.599> surfaces

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
finally we clean and caulk the surfaces

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:29.480 
finally we clean and caulk the surfaces
to<00:03:15.560> create<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.980> waterproof<00:03:16.490> seal
