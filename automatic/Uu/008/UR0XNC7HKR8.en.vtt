to<00:04:15.750> be<00:04:15.840> an<00:04:15.930> earlier<00:04:16.169> build<00:04:16.409> but<00:04:16.709> I'm<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.459> know

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
to be an earlier build but I'm you know

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.250 
to be an earlier build but I'm you know
I<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.789> what<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.060> find<00:04:18.180> out<00:04:18.479> how<00:04:18.810> kind<00:04:19.169> of

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
I see what I can find out how kind of

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.080 
I see what I can find out how kind of
maybe<00:04:19.440> different<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.430> next<00:04:20.459> build<00:04:20.849> will<00:04:21.000> be

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
maybe different the next build will be

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.820 
maybe different the next build will be
all<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.329> final<00:04:21.630> build<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.680> also

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
all the final build and it's also

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.080 
all the final build and it's also
probably<00:04:23.219> going<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.490> an<00:04:23.550> opportunity<00:04:23.849> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
probably going to be an opportunity to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.430 
probably going to be an opportunity to
play<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.450> game<00:04:24.599> at<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> end<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.080> sep<00:04:25.260> tember

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
play the game at the end of sep tember

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200 
play the game at the end of sep tember
or<00:04:25.710> early<00:04:26.039> october<00:04:26.099> egg

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
or early october egg

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.180 
or early october egg
which<00:04:27.750> will<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.259> more<00:04:28.500> complete<00:04:28.889> version
