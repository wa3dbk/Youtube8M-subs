00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
might look like what are the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.180 
might look like what are the
opportunities<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190

that<00:01:32.310> comes<00:01:32.670> primarily<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.260> high

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
that comes primarily from a very high

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.500

fairly flexible cost base and there's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.100 
fairly flexible cost base and there's
also<00:01:40.370> some<00:01:41.370> excitements<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> market<00:01:42.960> due

markets have been depressed for quite
some<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.330> there<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.630> potential<00:01:48.990> if

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
some time so there is potential if

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
some time so there is potential if

European and US construction markets

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.870 
European and US construction markets
come<00:01:51.660> back<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> normal<00:01:52.260> levels<00:01:52.530> again<00:01:52.620> I<00:01:53.070> think

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
come back to normal levels again I think

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.050 
come back to normal levels again I think
