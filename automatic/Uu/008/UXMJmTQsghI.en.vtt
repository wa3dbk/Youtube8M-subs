00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
old the teams in my opinion are the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
old the teams in my opinion are the
Miami<00:00:24.090> Heat<00:00:24.300> yes<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:25.140> lost<00:00:25.439> last<00:00:25.590> year<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
Miami Heat yes they lost last year but I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.620 
Miami Heat yes they lost last year but I
think<00:00:26.369> they're<00:00:26.490> bigger<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.029> better<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.480> every

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
think they're bigger and better in every

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
think they're bigger and better in every
position<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.769> center<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> center

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
position the center they have the center

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
position the center they have the center
back<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.199> point<00:00:31.470> guard<00:00:31.679> they

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
back up now and the point guard they

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
back up now and the point guard they
have<00:00:31.949> point<00:00:32.279> guard<00:00:32.489> back<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.660> think

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
have point guard back up now and I think

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840 
have point guard back up now and I think
they<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.170> possibly<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.579> got

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
they could possibly do it they just got

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
they could possibly do it they just got
to<00:00:36.059> control<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:37.500> winning<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to control when they're winning a lot I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700
