00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.570
 today we want to show them I was 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.939
 how to make an onion easy and fast 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.460
 even small cuts into cubes or 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.360
 first we have to strip the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.789
 peel onions 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.149
 to do this, take a small knife 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:33.509
 cuts down some of the root and 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.509
 on top 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.600
 you should be careful that first 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.050
 onion skin is not too thin 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.109
 because if you gave afterwards they will 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:56.729
 Like leather and you can not bite 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:01.440
 So take a little more generous 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.440
 and you have more of it and so 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.890
 to cut onions 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.549
 a thin knife with a thin one 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.080
 sound because the thin blade is better 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.049
 through service through the onions 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.690
 goes through and you have it easier 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:22.210
 then it is important to make sure that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.700
 To make a claw in jargon 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.740
 it's called can not make you look 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.680
 you cut your thumb 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.810
 behind and the fingers forward and on 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 the leadership of the fingers you cut the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.610
 first cut the flood and the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 let the roots together so that the teeth 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.520
 then something does not fall apart 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 turn once 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 twice transversely cut under enemies 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.200
 downward 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.960
 depending on how thin the slices are 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 the onion cubes are finer or 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.140
 coarser, for example, for a fine sauce 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.570
 I would be very nice for one 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:13.130
 Goulash or ragout is what you can do 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:14.990
 quiet the first left to the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.540
 there are two onion strips 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.790
 possibilities once the possibility 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.640
 that you are long on the onion 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.239
 then cuts one gets long stripes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.760
 which are more stable or you cut 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.820
 then you get across to the onion 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.270
 strip with shorter fibers then 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.680
 when cooking or stewing apart 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.170
 fall for example at a goulash 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.840
 you do not have the following after that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.200
 whole onion but only 1 onion 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.360
 must the sauce then bind us 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.390
 start now with those of syria the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 once fall apart and halve 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.880
 then and also well suited for 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.880
 example rumpsteak with onions and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.970
 mushrooms because you can not get on the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:14.150
 long onions must prove the 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:19.130
 onions just add to the taste 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:27.320
 the other variant is the root 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:29.900
 They already cut away the long to achieve that 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.480
 is in things such as onion soup 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.890
 better suited to it afterwards 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.739
 still the onion can recognize and how 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.060
 always said to pay attention to the claw 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.070
 the fingers stay home 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.680
 so now we have a syria here 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.950
 then even while you are still cooking 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.950
 stay
