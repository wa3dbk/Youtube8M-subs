00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to come up now what I'm thinking of is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380 
to come up now what I'm thinking of is
an<00:00:22.080> incentive<00:00:22.769> based<00:00:23.010> algorithm<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.269> know

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
an incentive based algorithm you know

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.779 
an incentive based algorithm you know
you<00:00:24.449> start<00:00:24.840> off<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> pack<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.800> calls<00:00:26.220> 5k

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you start off with the pack it calls 5k

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
you start off with the pack it calls 5k
bc<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:27.990> let<00:00:28.109> me<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> Emerald

say<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.390> five<00:00:36.690> percent<00:00:37.079> chance<00:00:37.380> right

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
say you have a five percent chance right

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
say you have a five percent chance right
now<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> open<00:00:38.640> those<00:00:38.790> packs<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:39.809> an

dope<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> percentage<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
dope with a percentage because if you

opening the packs it would have to be
different<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.759> example<00:01:24.360> five<00:01:24.930> percent

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.609 
chance with 5000 BC how about 20,000 bc
it's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.880> thirty<00:01:30.150> percent<00:01:30.540> chance<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it's a thirty percent chance not just

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's a thirty percent chance not just
for<00:01:31.799> times<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.490> would<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.610> twenty

incentive-based<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.130> incentive<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.939> that

incentive-based the incentive is that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pack the higher the chance it is but not

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.620

2<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.470> pointless<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:50.909> exponential

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

2 that's pointless but in an exponential
form<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.530> say<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:53.009> fifty<00:01:53.430> percent<00:01:53.790> more

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
form let's say you go fifty percent more
VC<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.110> 75<00:01:55.710> percent<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> chance

when<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.360> seventy-five<00:01:57.990> percent<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
mean a seventy-five percent growth so if

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840 
mean a seventy-five percent growth so if
you<00:02:04.320> spend<00:02:04.619> an<00:02:04.710> extra<00:02:04.829> fifty<00:02:05.310> percent<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> you

you spend an extra fifty percent of you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
you spend an extra fifty percent of you
see<00:02:06.060> maybe<00:02:06.600> an<00:02:06.780> extra<00:02:07.079> 75<00:02:07.530> percent<00:02:08.009> growth<00:02:08.250> in

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
see maybe an extra 75 percent growth in

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
see maybe an extra 75 percent growth in
the<00:02:08.640> chance<00:02:08.970> i<00:02:09.209> noticed<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> little<00:02:09.840> bit

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the chance i noticed a little bit

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
the chance i noticed a little bit
complicated<00:02:10.289> guys<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> really<00:02:11.730> look

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
complicated guys but if you really look

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.860 
complicated guys but if you really look
into<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.540> kind<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
into it it kind of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.930 
into it it kind of
makes<00:02:13.019> sense<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.890> incentive<00:02:14.610> based

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
makes sense it's incentive based

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
makes sense it's incentive based
algorithm<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.349> look<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.709> FIFA<00:02:17.129> for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
algorithm now if you look at FIFA for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.149 
algorithm now if you look at FIFA for
example<00:02:17.730> FIFA<00:02:18.060> 15<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.959> doesn't<00:02:19.409> use<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.650> idea

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
example FIFA 15 it doesn't use the idea

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.039 
example FIFA 15 it doesn't use the idea
down<00:02:20.370> talking<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
down talking about right now but it

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.039 
down talking about right now but it
vaguely<00:02:22.819> barely<00:02:23.819> uses<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> overall<00:02:24.840> concept

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
vaguely barely uses the overall concept

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.559 
vaguely barely uses the overall concept
and<00:02:25.650> people<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.549> can<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.540> can

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
and people what you can do is you can

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.720 
and people what you can do is you can
buy<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> gold<00:02:28.230> pack<00:02:28.470> right<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.769> gold<00:02:29.129> pack<00:02:29.310> costs

buy a gold pack right a gold pack costs
100<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.269> its<00:02:30.420> currency<00:02:30.780> instead<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.799> can<00:02:31.980> buy

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
100 of its currency instead you can buy

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.369 
100 of its currency instead you can buy

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
maybe 2k isn't ready for a full change
but<00:02:43.950> maybe<00:02:44.159> try<00:02:44.489> using<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.239> pack<00:02:45.510> or

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
but maybe try using this for a pack or

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.839 
but maybe try using this for a pack or
two<00:02:45.870> maybe<00:02:46.049> giving<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.920> try<00:02:47.129> giving<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
two maybe giving it a try giving it a

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.150 
two maybe giving it a try giving it a
little<00:02:48.120> bit<00:02:48.299> about<00:02:48.540> beta<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.650> guys<00:02:49.769> set

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
little bit about beta as you guys set

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.770 
little bit about beta as you guys set
something<00:02:50.609> before<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.090> sell<00:02:51.359> whether<00:02:51.599> or

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
something before you can sell whether or

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
something before you can sell whether or
not<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.079> works<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.950> honest<00:02:53.280> guys<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.819> was

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
not it works now to be honest guys I was

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.789 
not it works now to be honest guys I was
just<00:02:54.120> thinking<00:02:54.569> about<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.989> stuff<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.530> it

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
just thinking about this stuff and it

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.559 
just thinking about this stuff and it
just<00:02:55.829> hit<00:02:56.160> me<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.489> idea<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.120> didn't<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.540> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
just hit me this idea I didn't see it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.360 
just hit me this idea I didn't see it
anywhere<00:02:57.959> else<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.709> know<00:02:59.099> where<00:02:59.280> you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
anywhere else so you know where you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.789 
anywhere else so you know where you
heard<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.670> first<00:02:59.909> right<00:03:00.239> here<00:03:00.780> today<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.680> you

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
heard it first right here today so you

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.740 
heard it first right here today so you
guys<00:03:01.920> should<00:03:02.069> let<00:03:02.220> LD<00:03:02.730> andrade<00:03:03.120> no<00:03:03.420> I'll

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
guys should let LD andrade no I'll

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.080 
guys should let LD andrade no I'll
linked<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.379> video<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.069> who<00:03:05.459> knows<00:03:05.700> we

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
linked up this video and who knows we

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.390 
linked up this video and who knows we
might<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.780> an<00:03:06.900> idea<00:03:07.230> at<00:03:07.409> least<00:03:07.440> similar<00:03:08.069> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
might see an idea at least similar to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.780 
might see an idea at least similar to
this<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.819> NBA<00:03:09.359> 2k15<00:03:10.049> because<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.220> opinion<00:03:11.340> I

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
this in NBA 2k15 because in my opinion I

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.190 
this in NBA 2k15 because in my opinion I
think<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:12.090> will<00:03:12.269> help<00:03:12.390> people<00:03:12.750> open<00:03:13.109> up

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
think this will help people open up

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.830 
think this will help people open up
hacks<00:03:13.470> based<00:03:13.859> on<00:03:14.099> their<00:03:14.280> VC<00:03:14.700> situation<00:03:15.450> now

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
hacks based on their VC situation now

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.720 
hacks based on their VC situation now
one<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.170> thing<00:03:16.379> I<00:03:16.859> don't<00:03:17.220> think<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.549> there

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
one more thing I don't think that there

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580 
one more thing I don't think that there
should<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> situation<00:03:18.299> where<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.319> can<00:03:19.500> make

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
should be a situation where you can make

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.650 
should be a situation where you can make
the<00:03:19.739> odds<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:20.130> hundred<00:03:20.430> percent<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the odds a hundred percent I think the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.360 
the odds a hundred percent I think the
highest<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> should<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.620> able<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.040> allow<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
highest you should be able to allow a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.729 
highest you should be able to allow a
pax<00:03:23.760> odds<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.359> be<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.750> twenty-five<00:03:25.590> percent

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
pax odds to be is twenty-five percent

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.280 
pax odds to be is twenty-five percent
that's<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.519> maxed<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.510> how<00:03:27.750> much<00:03:27.870> vc

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
that's if you maxed out of how much vc

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.020 
that's if you maxed out of how much vc
you<00:03:28.410> spend<00:03:28.769> because<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.609> make<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.819> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
you spend because if you make it a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
you spend because if you make it a
hundred<00:03:30.209> percent<00:03:30.510> where<00:03:31.169> you<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.410> spend<00:03:31.680> so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
hundred percent where you can spend so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.619 
hundred percent where you can spend so
much<00:03:32.099> on<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> pack<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.819> want<00:03:33.180> understand

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
much on a pack and you want understand

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.809 
much on a pack and you want understand
get<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> player<00:03:34.049> at<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:35.010> point<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.609> pretty

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
get the player at that point it's pretty

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.759 
get the player at that point it's pretty
much<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.060> market<00:03:36.540> guys<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.440> know<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.739> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
much the market guys so I know it's a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.500 
much the market guys so I know it's a
little<00:03:37.980> bit<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.160> complicated<00:03:38.400> concept<00:03:38.819> but

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
little bit of a complicated concept but

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.780 
little bit of a complicated concept but
if<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:39.750> look<00:03:39.870> at<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.200> basic<00:03:40.560> idea<00:03:41.250> it's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
if you look at the basic idea it's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.699 
if you look at the basic idea it's
actually<00:03:42.209> pretty<00:03:42.299> simple<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.019> who<00:03:43.500> knows

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
actually pretty simple and who knows

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
actually pretty simple and who knows
you'll<00:03:43.949> be<00:03:43.980> pretty<00:03:44.280> cool<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> K<00:03:44.970> ends<00:03:45.419> up

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
you'll be pretty cool to K ends up

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.720 
you'll be pretty cool to K ends up
