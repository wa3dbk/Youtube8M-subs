00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.290
 today residents of several countries and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 cities literally agitated 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 the news of the powerful earthquake of Moscow and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.049
 Astana felt significant 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.320
 tremors in the Russian capital 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.940
 even about 900 people were evacuated 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 my colleague and squeezed tried 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
 to figure out how in the territories 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 non- elevated areas 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 seismic activity could occur 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 underground fluctuations noon residents 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 Astana feels countries and underground 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 vibrations and since the earthquake in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 capital, I basically can not be 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.520
 citizens take tremors for echoes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 to the nearest construction site after a few 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.510
 minutes it becomes clear that the fluctuations 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 soil be felt throughout the city and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 Means construction is not to blame 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.789
 really all the same earthquake people don't 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.470
 believe it when it was not today today 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.930
 insofar as 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.670
 This hour there is not even heard about this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 what was really requested 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.750
 passes another half an hour and through the social network 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 Astana residents learn that tremors 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 felt throughout kazakhstan for 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.870
 explanations journalists go to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 specialists and devour 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.030
 I will be 54 latitude earthquake passed 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.770
 invent territory specialists 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 bind a wave of underground oscillations 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 greatest earthquake in Okhotsk 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 sea 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 it happened at about nine forty 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.410
 four in the morning Moscow time 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.780
 the center was located at a depth of 600 meters 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.140
 the magnitude of aftershocks was 8 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.330
 and 2 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 there is a physical concept like 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.180
 resonance vibration theory 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.060
 we most cases this question is not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.500
 take into account these fluctuations 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.710
 too far they were not reflected not on 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.020
 destruction 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.150
 mine damage facilities and structures 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.460
 a wave of oscillations swept not only 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 Kazakhstan and also in Russia and Europe in 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 Moscow felt jolts of a magnitude 2 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 it scared some residents 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.369
 white-stone rescuers had them 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.110
 evacuate about 900 people in total 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.750
 the information that came 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.760
 violations of livelihood of the population do not have 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.720
 all infrastructure facilities 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.880
 normal mode 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.680
 however, experts warn 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.810
 an earthquake with the same magnitude but 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 a little closer to serious destruction would 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.410
 not escape meanwhile today 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.090
 it turned out that there is no Astana 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.070
 magnitude measuring instruments 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.170
 earthquakes when we turned to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.900
 through no one could provide data 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.640
 about body tremors aigul same
