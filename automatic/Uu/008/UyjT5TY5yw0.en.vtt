00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
going to make it a metallic black and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
going to make it a metallic black and
the<00:00:56.610> Priscilla<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the Priscilla is going to also be a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
the Priscilla is going to also be a
black<00:00:59.840> because<00:01:00.840> normally<00:01:01.199> these<00:01:01.289> cars<00:01:01.590> are

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
black because normally these cars are

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
black because normally these cars are
full<00:01:02.160> black<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
full black and they don't really have a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.690 
full black and they don't really have a
shine<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.820> full<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.450> black

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
shine so it's going to be full on black

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
shine so it's going to be full on black
the<00:01:08.700> wheels<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.810> wheels

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the wheels are going to be the wheels

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
the wheels are going to be the wheels

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
are going to stay silver because they

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.710 
are going to stay silver because they
don't<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.810> paint<00:01:13.140> their<00:01:13.380> wheels<00:01:14.720> wait

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.640 

and<00:01:23.110> they're<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.619> wheels<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.140> wheels<00:01:29.320> i

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
and they're the wheels so the wheels i

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.649 
and they're the wheels so the wheels i
was<00:01:29.799> scrolling<00:01:30.159> through<00:01:30.340> them<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.030> i

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
was scrolling through them and i

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.370 
was scrolling through them and i
couldn't<00:01:32.020> really<00:01:32.170> find<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.710> good<00:01:33.840> match<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.200> i

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
couldn't really find a good match and i

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.859 
couldn't really find a good match and i
actually<00:01:35.590> figured<00:01:36.009> out<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:37.600> something

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
actually figured out that's something

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.149 
actually figured out that's something
like<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.869> something<00:01:41.320> like<00:01:41.580> where<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.729> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
like that or something like where is it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.539 
like that or something like where is it
something<00:01:45.159> like<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.399> would<00:01:45.880> be<00:01:45.940> good<00:01:47.549> what

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
something like that would be good what
