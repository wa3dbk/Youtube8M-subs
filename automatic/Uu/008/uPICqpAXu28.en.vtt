00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
there and then the bucket to this little

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.210 
there and then the bucket to this little
action

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.580 

so<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:28.940> been<00:03:29.210> a<00:03:29.240> fun<00:03:29.480> toy<00:03:29.780> from<00:03:30.020> Michael<00:03:30.440> he's

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so it's been a fun toy from Michael he's

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.660 
so it's been a fun toy from Michael he's
enjoyed<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:33.230> seems<00:03:33.530> fairly<00:03:34.100> sturdy<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.610> me

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
enjoyed it it seems fairly sturdy to me

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.890 
enjoyed it it seems fairly sturdy to me
it<00:03:35.240> is<00:03:35.450> made<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.810> plastic<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.650> guess<00:03:36.920> after

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
it is made of plastic so I guess after

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.120 
it is made of plastic so I guess after
maybe<00:03:38.900> more<00:03:39.590> weeks<00:03:39.980> or<00:03:40.310> months<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:42.130> playing

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
maybe more weeks or months of playing

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.560 
maybe more weeks or months of playing
maybe<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.610> does<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:44.000> some<00:03:44.210> problem<00:03:44.540> with

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
maybe it does have some problem with

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.690 
maybe it does have some problem with
some<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.960> parts<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:46.070> we<00:03:46.340> haven't<00:03:46.490> had<00:03:46.640> any

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
some of the parts but we haven't had any

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.290 
some of the parts but we haven't had any
problems<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.210> far<00:03:47.240> and<00:03:48.700> we<00:03:49.700> think<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.120> good

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
problems so far and we think it's a good

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.470 
problems so far and we think it's a good
little<00:03:50.930> toy<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:52.490> looks<00:03:52.730> like<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.030> real<00:03:53.180> thing

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
little toy it looks like the real thing

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.780 
little toy it looks like the real thing
anyway<00:03:53.960> liked<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.130> saw<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.370> at<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.640> toy
