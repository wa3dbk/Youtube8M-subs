with Dino fuss at that point became
interesting<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.700> know<00:00:28.820> what<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:30.200> how<00:00:30.560> that

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
interesting to know what that how that

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.230 
interesting to know what that how that
those<00:00:31.189> feathers<00:00:31.520> could<00:00:31.669> have<00:00:31.759> influenced<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
those feathers could have influenced the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.080 
those feathers could have influenced the
appearance<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.810> it

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.240 

what<00:00:37.600> we<00:00:37.690> found<00:00:37.870> out<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.290> that<00:00:38.320> fossil

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
what we found out is that fossil

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.820 
what we found out is that fossil
fighters<00:00:39.400> they<00:00:39.700> preserve<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.500> melanin<00:00:41.500> that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
fighters they preserve the melanin that

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.290 
fighters they preserve the melanin that
is<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> pigment<00:00:42.490> that<00:00:42.520> gives<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.850> color<00:00:43.090> to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
is the pigment that gives the color to

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.300 
is the pigment that gives the color to
the<00:00:43.420> feather<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.560> way<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:44.650> I<00:00:44.860> got<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.100> I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
the feather so the way that I got it I

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.920 
the feather so the way that I got it I
got<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.790> idea<00:00:45.880> that<00:00:46.120> we<00:00:46.360> could<00:00:46.390> potentially

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
got the idea that we could potentially

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.990 
got the idea that we could potentially
use<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.860> put<00:00:48.130> colors<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.580> dinosaurs

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
use this to put colors and dinosaurs

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.910 
use this to put colors and dinosaurs
came<00:00:49.180> from<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.450> very<00:00:49.480> odd<00:00:49.809> angle<00:00:50.230> because<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.800> was

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
came from a very odd angle because I was

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.160 
came from a very odd angle because I was
actually<00:00:51.040> looking<00:00:51.220> at<00:00:51.550> fossil<00:00:51.910> squids<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.480> we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
actually looking at fossil squids and we

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.189 
actually looking at fossil squids and we
find<00:00:53.410> puzzle<00:00:53.770> squids<00:00:54.330> that<00:00:55.330> have<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.720> ink<00:00:55.930> sac

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
find puzzle squids that have the ink sac

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.590 
find puzzle squids that have the ink sac
preserved<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.940> quite<00:00:57.940> interestingly<00:00:58.180> when

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
preserved and quite interestingly when

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.750 
preserved and quite interestingly when
you<00:00:58.720> look<00:00:58.870> at<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.080> fossilized<00:00:59.800> ink<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.640> can

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
you look at this fossilized ink you can

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.610 
you look at this fossilized ink you can
actually<00:01:00.910> see<00:01:01.090> that<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.930> preserves<00:01:02.379> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
actually see that it preserves the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.400 
actually see that it preserves the
pigment<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:04.210> made<00:01:04.479> me<00:01:04.510> think<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:04.930> we

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
pigment and that made me think that we

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.490 
pigment and that made me think that we
should<00:01:05.619> be<00:01:05.650> able<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.950> find<00:01:06.660> this<00:01:07.660> pigment

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
should be able to find this pigment

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.380 
should be able to find this pigment
which<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.920> melanin<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.520> other<00:01:10.000> kinds<00:01:10.210> of

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
plumage what Rick he said when he first

plumage what Rick he said when he first
saw<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.530> thing<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:55.980> started<00:02:56.340> realizing

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
saw this thing and we started realizing

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.190 
saw this thing and we started realizing
what<00:02:56.940> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> color<00:02:57.360> patterns<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.810> hat<00:02:57.960> he

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
what kind of color patterns and hat he

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.500 
what kind of color patterns and hat he
said<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> looks<00:02:58.740> like<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> spangled<00:02:59.400> Hamburg<00:02:59.790> if

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
said it looks like a spangled Hamburg if

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
said it looks like a spangled Hamburg if
you<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.410> ng<00:03:02.220> owners<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.880> called

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you see this ng owners as it's called

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.630 
you see this ng owners as it's called
and<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> quick<00:03:05.070> look<00:03:05.130> at<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and just have a quick look at it and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.220 
and just have a quick look at it and
look<00:03:05.820> away<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.060> think<00:03:06.180> most<00:03:06.630> people<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:06.930> say

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
look away I think most people would say

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.210 
look away I think most people would say
that<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:08.010> looks<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> chicken

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.580 

this<00:03:15.220> fossil<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.640> from<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.540> latest<00:03:16.810> Jurassic

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
this fossil is from the latest Jurassic

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.000 
this fossil is from the latest Jurassic
of<00:03:17.800> rounding<00:03:18.400> Province<00:03:18.849> in<00:03:19.060> China<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.890> these

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
of rounding Province in China so these

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.740 
of rounding Province in China so these
Chinese<00:03:21.459> examples<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.090> extraordinary<00:03:22.420> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
Chinese examples are extraordinary and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.020 
Chinese examples are extraordinary and
that<00:03:23.019> many<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.410> them<00:03:23.560> do<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:24.010> an<00:03:24.340> outline<00:03:25.000> of

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
that many of them do have an outline of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.809 
that many of them do have an outline of
the<00:03:25.300> feathers<00:03:25.629> on<00:03:25.900> both<00:03:26.280> extinct<00:03:27.280> birds<00:03:27.519> and

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
the feathers on both extinct birds and

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.839 
the feathers on both extinct birds and
these<00:03:28.090> are<00:03:28.450> early<00:03:28.480> dinosaurs<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
these are early dinosaurs so the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.460 
these are early dinosaurs so the
interesting<00:03:31.060> prospect<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.349> we

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
interesting prospect of this is that we

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.710 
interesting prospect of this is that we
can<00:03:32.709> see<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.130> mountain<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.670> preserved<00:03:34.510> in

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
can see that mountain is preserved in

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.500 
can see that mountain is preserved in
all<00:03:35.200> these<00:03:35.380> fossil<00:03:35.800> feathers<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.269> rule

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
all these fossil feathers it's the rule

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.990 
all these fossil feathers it's the rule
rather<00:03:38.349> than<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.650> exception

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.330 

the<00:03:44.990> future

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
the future

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.770 
the future
in<00:03:46.370> dinosaur<00:03:46.819> paleontology<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.599> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
in dinosaur paleontology and the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
paleontology of birds and mammals will

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.660 
paleontology of birds and mammals will
be<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.900> we<00:03:51.319> we<00:03:51.769> will<00:03:51.920> probably<00:03:52.280> be<00:03:52.370> able<00:03:52.580> to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
be that we we will probably be able to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.050 
be that we we will probably be able to
reconstruct<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.450> some<00:03:53.900> detail<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.730> color

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
reconstruct in some detail the color

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.330 
reconstruct in some detail the color
that<00:03:56.930> they<00:03:57.050> had<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.260> life<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.190> like

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
that they had in life this is like

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.970 
that they had in life this is like
