00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
find that as a similar tonality as well

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.810 
find that as a similar tonality as well
there's<00:01:32.680> those<00:01:33.100> differences<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.700> course

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
there's those differences of course

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
cherry tends to be pretty bright but it

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.940

is<00:01:36.550> bright<00:01:36.850> but<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.510> still<00:01:37.780> find<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.620> it's<00:01:38.830> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
is bright but I still find it's a it's a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.100 
is bright but I still find it's a it's a
little<00:01:39.160> softer<00:01:39.910> sounding<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.510> like<00:01:40.780> you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
little softer sounding that like you

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.780 
little softer sounding that like you
know<00:01:41.230> real<00:01:41.620> hard<00:01:41.890> maple<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.430> still<00:01:42.580> in<00:01:42.700> the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
know real hard maple it's still in the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.969 
know real hard maple it's still in the
maple<00:01:43.090> family<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.410> gives<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.800> nice

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
maple family so it gives you a nice

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.100 
maple family so it gives you a nice
little<00:01:45.190> punch<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:46.300> there<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.540> some<00:01:46.720> cushion

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
little punch but there is some cushion

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.680 
little punch but there is some cushion
there<00:01:47.260> if<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.410> makes<00:01:47.710> any<00:01:47.830> sense<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:48.340> know

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
there if that makes any sense you know

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.570 
there if that makes any sense you know
okay<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.900> got<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.620> double<00:01:51.220> O<00:01:51.280> or

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
okay so you got this is a double O or

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.030 
okay so you got this is a double O or
