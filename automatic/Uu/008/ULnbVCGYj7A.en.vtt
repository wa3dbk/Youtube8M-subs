really really easy takes three tools and
I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.260> probably<00:00:43.440> pay<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.280> five<00:00:44.489> dollars

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

I think I probably pay like five dollars
total<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.420> order<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.100> very

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
total in order to do this so it was very

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
total in order to do this so it was very
easy<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> show<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.899> how

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
lash glue or liquid latex either work

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
lash glue or liquid latex either work

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because most lash glues are just liquid

stay<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.890> night<00:01:35.070> long<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> try<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> remember

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stay all night long to try to remember

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
stay all night long to try to remember
that<00:01:36.180> they're<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.560> much

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that they're there because it's much

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.230 
that they're there because it's much
easier<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.070> flick<00:01:38.340> off<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> jewel<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
easier to flick off a jewel than it is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
easier to flick off a jewel than it is
to<00:01:39.420> flick<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> whole<00:01:40.170> set<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> lashes<00:01:40.950> now

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
to flick off a whole set of lashes now

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
to flick off a whole set of lashes now
my<00:01:41.520> next<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:41.939> jewels<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
my next two jewels are going to be a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.149 
my next two jewels are going to be a
little<00:01:43.110> tiny<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.040> they're

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
little tiny bit different but they're

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.560 
little tiny bit different but they're
still<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> same<00:01:44.909> size<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
still going to be the same size of this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
still going to be the same size of this
pink<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.430> they're<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.820> like

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
pink one and they're going to be like

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
pink one and they're going to be like
this<00:01:48.090> iridescent<00:01:48.810> color<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.740> same<00:01:50.189> exact

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
this iridescent color so same exact

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
this iridescent color so same exact
process<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.320> one

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
process but I'm going to put this one

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
process but I'm going to put this one
just<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.829> tiny<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.220> higher<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.470> like<00:01:55.470> right

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
just a tiny bit higher and like right

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.929 
just a tiny bit higher and like right
above<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.820> eyebrow<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:59.100> painting<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.729> washed

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
above my eyebrow just painting it washed

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.429 
above my eyebrow just painting it washed
blue<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> back

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
blue on the back

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.929 
blue on the back
and<00:02:03.439> I'll<00:02:03.710> put<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:03.979> one<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.490> other<00:02:04.640> side

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
and I'll put this one on the other side

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.969 
and I'll put this one on the other side
in<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.360> same<00:02:05.570> place<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.850> put<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> other

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
in the same place that I put the other

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.530 
in the same place that I put the other
so<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.009> got<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> tiny<00:02:10.640> bit<00:02:10.849> of<00:02:10.940> lash<00:02:11.090> glue<00:02:11.330> on

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
so I got like a tiny bit of lash glue on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.490 
so I got like a tiny bit of lash glue on
the<00:02:11.630> side<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.989> but<00:02:12.140> I'm<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.319> going<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the side of it but I'm not going to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.809 
the side of it but I'm not going to
worry<00:02:12.620> about<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.920> because<00:02:13.040> lash<00:02:13.370> glue<00:02:13.550> dries

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
worry about that because lash glue dries

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.670 
worry about that because lash glue dries
clear<00:02:14.030> next<00:02:14.450> I'm<00:02:14.569> going<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.870> take<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.260> set<00:02:15.560> of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
clear next I'm going to take a set of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.710 
clear next I'm going to take a set of
smaller<00:02:15.980> jewels<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.610> those<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.360> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.599> go

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
smaller jewels and those are going to go

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.070 
smaller jewels and those are going to go

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
size Jules you want i'm just going to do

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.000 
size Jules you want i'm just going to do
like<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.780> three<00:02:27.080> bigger<00:02:27.290> ones<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.800> middle

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
like the three bigger ones in the middle

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.350 
like the three bigger ones in the middle
of<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.130> smaller<00:02:28.459> ones<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> edges<00:02:29.209> but

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
of the smaller ones on the edges but

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.699 
of the smaller ones on the edges but
it's<00:02:29.569> completely<00:02:29.989> up<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.500> make

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
it's completely up to you you can make

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.530 
it's completely up to you you can make
this<00:02:30.860> your<00:02:30.920> own<00:02:31.069> ones<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.760> i'm<00:02:31.849> using<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
this your own ones that i'm using on the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.690 
this your own ones that i'm using on the
edges<00:02:32.840> now<00:02:32.989> are<00:02:33.230> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.590> match<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.489> two

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
edges now are going to match the two

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030 
edges now are going to match the two
that<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.090> around<00:02:35.510> my<00:02:35.959> pink<00:02:36.200> middle<00:02:36.560> drool<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
that are around my pink middle drool so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.170 
that are around my pink middle drool so
they're<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.459> be<00:02:37.550> like<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.850> slightly

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
they're going to be like that slightly

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.809 
they're going to be like that slightly
iridescent<00:02:38.870> color<00:02:39.050> they're<00:02:39.950> called<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.430> be

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
iridescent color they're called a be

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.039 
iridescent color they're called a be
crystals<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.630> can<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.900> them<00:02:42.019> at

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
crystals and you can get them at

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.710 
crystals and you can get them at
basically<00:02:42.530> any<00:02:42.769> craft<00:02:43.069> store<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.970> now<00:02:44.180> this

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
basically any craft store so now this

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.530 
basically any craft store so now this
one<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.350> going<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.920> be<00:02:46.190> spaced<00:02:46.970> apart<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
one is just going to be spaced apart the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.350 
one is just going to be spaced apart the
same<00:02:47.690> amount<00:02:48.340> will<00:02:49.340> place<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> little

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
same amount will place just a little

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.600 
same amount will place just a little
higher<00:02:50.540> just<00:02:51.080> like<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.350> one<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> want<00:02:52.489> them

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
higher just like this one so I want them

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.479 
higher just like this one so I want them
to<00:02:52.640> go<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:53.810> sheet<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.560> around<00:02:54.980> my

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
to go in this sheet like around my

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.050 
to go in this sheet like around my
eyebrows

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690 

so<00:03:02.780> notice<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.709> about<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.250> point<00:03:04.489> when<00:03:04.670> i

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
so notice that about the point when i

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.250 
so notice that about the point when i
get<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> my<00:03:05.030> arch<00:03:05.330> i'm<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.930> start<00:03:06.110> going

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
get to my arch i'm going to start going

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.930 
get to my arch i'm going to start going
downward<00:03:06.920> again

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.180 

so<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.570> can<00:03:17.900> stop<00:03:18.140> wherever<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.590> like<00:03:18.860> or<00:03:19.130> you

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
so you can stop wherever you like or you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.920 
so you can stop wherever you like or you
can<00:03:19.370> make<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> keep<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.030> i'm<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.810> gonna

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
can make it keep going i'm just gonna
