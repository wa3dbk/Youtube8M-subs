want to put something that keeps players

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.400 
want to put something that keeps players
from<00:02:07.560> wanting<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.569> found

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
from wanting to do that I found

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
from wanting to do that I found
self<00:02:10.620> constantly<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.910> was

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
self constantly like I was

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.720 
self constantly like I was
hypersensitive<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.830> oxygen<00:02:14.310> meter<00:02:14.460> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
hypersensitive to that oxygen meter and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.580 
hypersensitive to that oxygen meter and
it<00:02:14.790> did<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.150> drain<00:02:15.630> way<00:02:15.960> faster<00:02:16.410> than<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it did actually drain way faster than I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
it did actually drain way faster than I
thought<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.920> should<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> point<00:02:17.850> where

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
thought it should be to the point where

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
thought it should be to the point where
I<00:02:18.120> found<00:02:18.300> myself<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:19.200> paying<00:02:19.500> attention<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I found myself not paying attention to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.710 
I found myself not paying attention to
the<00:02:19.980> art<00:02:20.280> with<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.820> environment<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.690> even

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the art with the environment not even

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.450 
the art with the environment not even
paying<00:02:22.110> attention<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.710> mission<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> would

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
paying attention to the mission I would

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.740 
paying attention to the mission I would
get<00:02:23.580> an<00:02:23.670> update<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> mission<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> little

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
get an update on the mission a little

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.090 
get an update on the mission a little
face<00:02:24.930> would<00:02:25.110> pop<00:02:25.290> up<00:02:25.320> at<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> bottom<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
face would pop up at the bottom and it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
face would pop up at the bottom and it
would<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.060> oh<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:27.750> god<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.140> is

saying but I couldn't because I was

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.520 
saying but I couldn't because I was
concentrating<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.810> how<00:02:33.990> long<00:02:34.320> this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530

conversation<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.910> how<00:02:36.060> much

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
conversation was going on and how much

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.650 
conversation was going on and how much
my<00:02:36.810> oxygen<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.590> draining<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.280> puts<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.060> huge

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
my oxygen was draining it puts a huge

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.720 
my oxygen was draining it puts a huge
damper<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.710> whole<00:02:40.740> game<00:02:41.430> play<00:02:41.700> experience

damper on the whole game play experience

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.080 
damper on the whole game play experience
I<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:43.230> finding<00:02:43.950> myself<00:02:44.100> running<00:02:44.730> through

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
I was finding myself running through

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.850 
I was finding myself running through
enemies<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.810> try<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> get<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.440> closest

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
enemies to try to get to the closest

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.520 
enemies to try to get to the closest
oxygen<00:02:47.400> station<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:48.570> finding<00:02:48.840> myself<00:02:49.020> just

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
oxygen station I was finding myself just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.200 
oxygen station I was finding myself just
not<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:49.980> paying<00:02:50.160> attention<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.790> what<00:02:51.060> was

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
not really paying attention to what was

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.350 
not really paying attention to what was
going<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:53.490> overall<00:02:53.970> just

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
going on and the overall just

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660 
going on and the overall just
environment<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> game<00:02:55.500> because<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.550> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
environment of the game because of that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.640 
environment of the game because of that
oxygen<00:02:57.150> refill<00:02:57.450> station<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.960> wasn't<00:02:58.170> enjoying

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
oxygen refill station I wasn't enjoying

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.290 
oxygen refill station I wasn't enjoying
killing<00:02:59.220> enemies<00:02:59.520> because<00:02:59.790> they<00:02:59.910> were<00:02:59.970> taking

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
killing enemies because they were taking

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.150 
killing enemies because they were taking
too<00:03:00.420> much<00:03:00.540> time<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:01.140> was<00:03:01.560> enjoying<00:03:01.770> exploring

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
too much time I was enjoying exploring

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.250 
too much time I was enjoying exploring
because<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.820> was<00:03:03.000> taking<00:03:03.300> too<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.570> time<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
because I was taking too much time and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.630 
because I was taking too much time and
there<00:03:05.070> was<00:03:05.280> oxygen<00:03:05.910> refill<00:03:06.330> stations<00:03:07.460> kind<00:03:08.460> of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
there was oxygen refill stations kind of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.400 
there was oxygen refill stations kind of
everywhere<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.300> weren't<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.900> close<00:03:10.110> as

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
everywhere but they weren't as close as

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.470 
everywhere but they weren't as close as
I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.710> they<00:03:10.830> should<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.460> in<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.240> game

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
I think they should be and in this game

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
I think they should be and in this game
there<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.870> very<00:03:13.230> low<00:03:13.440> gravity<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.070> can

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there is very low gravity so you can

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.680 
there is very low gravity so you can
kind<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.520> like<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.700> crackdown<00:03:15.000> jump<00:03:15.480> where

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
kind of do like a crackdown jump where

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.530 
kind of do like a crackdown jump where
you<00:03:15.990> jumping<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.040> float<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.240> lot<00:03:18.510> of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you jumping kind of float so a lot of

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.780 
you jumping kind of float so a lot of
the<00:03:18.750> levels<00:03:19.140> are<00:03:19.410> multi<00:03:19.890> level<00:03:20.280> where<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.610> are

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
the levels are multi level where you are

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.120 
the levels are multi level where you are
going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.270> be<00:03:21.420> using<00:03:22.020> these<00:03:22.350> things<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.010> glow

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
going to be using these things that glow

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
going to be using these things that glow
in<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> ground<00:03:23.640> kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> will<00:03:24.330> help<00:03:24.480> you

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
in the ground kind of will help you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.020 
in the ground kind of will help you
shoot<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.280> little<00:03:26.430> bit<00:03:26.580> more<00:03:26.730> give<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
shoot you up a little bit more give you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.190 
shoot you up a little bit more give you
some<00:03:27.209> more<00:03:27.450> air<00:03:27.780> time<00:03:28.140> or<00:03:28.500> some<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.490> know

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
some more air time or some you know

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.150 
some more air time or some you know
acceleration<00:03:31.200> pads<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.620> run<00:03:31.860> across<00:03:31.950> a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
acceleration pads you run across a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.310 
acceleration pads you run across a
message<00:03:32.670> across<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.780> know<00:03:33.870> those<00:03:34.110> are<00:03:34.230> very

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
message across you know those are very

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.199 
message across you know those are very
kind<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.709> standard<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.580> everything's<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:36.180> of

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
kind of standard so everything's kind of

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.610 
kind of standard so everything's kind of
layer<00:03:36.450> there's<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:36.900> dimension<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
layer there's more dimension to the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.750
