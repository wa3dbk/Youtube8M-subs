00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.330
 Hello 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
 welcome to photographer how 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.120
 photograph points like today 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.340
 I will tell you about the exhibition 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.320
 what is the exhibition the exhibition 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.789
 it's the amount of light that goes 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.770
 go on your sensor to make a 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.289
 properly exposed picture a 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.400
 exposure it can be a picture too 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.890
 under-exposed with not enough light 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.449
 who is she going to be a little dark or 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
 too dark sometimes it's also 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.360
 the exposure an image that is overexposed 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.490
 with too much light and clear electro 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.670
 the exhibition we will be able to act with the 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.289
 speed the diaphragm and sensitivity 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.300
 in general when one makes a catch of 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.260
 seen as here I am in front of them 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.629
 twins we will define in the first place the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.070
 sensitivity like that once the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.680
 sensitivity is set ben I do not 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.809
 not come back rarely and we can 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.570
 play with speed and premium for 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.590
 to have a correct exposure so there I 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.620
 am in manual mode 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.660
 so I defined my correct exposure 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 which is 1250th of a second for a 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.140
 sensitivity of 200 iso there we are in 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.600
 winter light and at lower but of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 sun so it's nice so here is my 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.860
 correct exposure at least I think so 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.590
 that's what says me no camera 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 I'm doing my picture here is my exhibition 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 is very much this exhibition if I 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.720
 want for example have a speed more 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.720
 slow I'm going to do the 250th I'm going 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.970
 go down to the 125th I get off a diaf 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.590
 I do my picture as I slowed my 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.580
 speed I'm more light that 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.650
 went back into the camera 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.650
 so I have an overexposed image 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.619
 so if I want to compensate for coming back 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.479
 with a slower speed in the image 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.719
 that I had everything to their exhibits 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.810
 so what am I going to do I'm going to close 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.280
 the diaphragm of diabetes or not and that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.939
 I had gone to 8 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 so here is slowing down the speed 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.319
 I compensated by closing world 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 clothes slower speed more than 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.330
 light enters I close my diaphragm 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.090
 I reduce the light coming in so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.950
 we can compensate on both we have 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.930
 also in speed priority mode or 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 priority diaphragm this is the device that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 will compensate himself with his cell 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.190
 integrated so he will measure the light 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 all alone and he will find me the good 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.879
 so manual fashion exposure I'm going 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.530
 switch to priority speed mode 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:42.290
 so here I am at the 500th 1,500th f32,200 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.109
 I'm doing my picture correctly 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.250
 exposed and if I want a speed more 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:53.450
 slow 250th you see it compensates 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.060
 himself by going to 4 5 6 3 125th 6 3 I 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.519
 do my picture and here I come a 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.049
 identical result 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.049
 so that's the show you have everything 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.030
 a lot of possibilities to play with 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.829
 so do not hesitate to use all 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.599
 possible modes manual priority speed 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.859
 priority diaphragm to play with 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.750
 the exhibition is well understand the 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.190
 operation speed diaphragm in 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.410
 setting the sensitivity before 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.579
 make your photo listened to it do not hesitate 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.980
 to leave a comment to ask me your 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.960
 questions and also register on the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.880
 site how to photograph point com 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.120
 I tell you very soon pejeta at 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.120
 meet again 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.430
 1 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.940
 but a lot
