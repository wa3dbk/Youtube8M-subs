00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.310
 of care of the blue is gone 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 to comment on things I remembered little 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.550
 in the locker room I 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.079
 say do after mans heat up in 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 a lot of stages there are big 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 changing rooms so first a room where the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 players can change themselves obviously 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 but there is another room big enough 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 the one and spacious where the players 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.759
 can do stretching one can 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.070
 take the ball make some 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.659
 juggling as everyone's 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 warm ups rise from young talent to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.750
 does not hunt leave true 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.190
 to go gradually 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 let's start with fritschi breaks 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.720
 so the guards also have to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 to prepare well and to warm up well 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.030
 a lot of jump rope already before 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 match to go up a little bit 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.850
 back up the heart the warm up hard 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 About 25 minutes I'm a little bit of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.190
 bike by had some movements and he 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.049
 already accustomed their bodies to the effort 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.540
 jump rope 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:00.390
 I think of what I know 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.390
 to say one day I isolate myself in a corner 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 from the staff cloakroom to put me in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.479
 provision of cocan warming up 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.979
 because the kids warm up and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.989
 his warm up is really needed 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.700
 to shock me to feel good 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.060
 do not we get the match the essential 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.349
 of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.040
 of warming up happens on the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.630
 course obviously hugo starts 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.290
 actually warming up from 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.300
 moment he 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.420
 he returns to the field he returns on 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.430
 the field six minutes before the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.920
 players the field players that's at 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.010
 Base racing base little change 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 of funfounded exercise without balloon and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.800
 exercises with balloon warm up 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.640
 ends twenty minutes before the start of 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.239
 match 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.530
 so there is always the risk that 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.319
 the warm-up finally is too early 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.720
 but we are caught by the organization of the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.010
 match and 20 minutes after it takes 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.230
 leaving the field is good 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 preparation to be ready for the match 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.040
 and not to snap do not get 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 hurt on an acceleration or on a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 greedy
