00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 taylor doing says welcome back to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 pokémon ruins omega in this part there 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 we find in front of the tower of the skies and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.900
 because I have to do a part that I would have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.969
 wanted to do towards the end of the ex play 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.889
 if I have to be honest but that I am in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 do today because you asked me in 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 so many and since I want 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 to satisfy you because I am too good 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 but today I wanted to do it 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 together with the other legendaries because yes 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 today we're going to get a legendary 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.599
 then let's start from the beginning 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.240
 in the final part of the delta episode 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.510
 or my part and 41 of the former play of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 ruby name that we did precisely the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.280
 final chapter in which we destroyed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 the meteorite that was about to collapse 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.340
 suhonen we got maybe almost e 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.510
 we also met from opsis 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 however that is not the only time in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 which one can meet and then capture 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.629
 or defeat yours in your opinion 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.059
 in fact the pokémon deoxys in fact gold 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 ko mandate because it also seemed to me the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.910
 bad catch for two legendary in one 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.750
 part only I would have taken importance to one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 or to the other then not sent ko but 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.840
 defeating the pokémon league for the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.619
 second time it will be possible to meet again 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 deoxys on the top of the tower of the skies 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.060
 just go and press on this 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 triangle and that stone slab 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.040
 and appeared deoxys ok then deoxys ho 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.780
 read several discussions on the internet 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 regarding this pokémon everyone 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.580
 we know the games have been 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.690
 facilitated a lot but really a 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.330
 bag 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.650
 as well as xy and therefore legendary not 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.910
 they are so difficult to invoice 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.160
 we could also see it with 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.720
 rayquaza entered type after three o 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.050
 four ultrà stamp now not me 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.900
 I remember the pokémon of which we all are 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.750
 complained is only one or deoxys that a 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.060
 level 80 and that is not so difficult 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 to capture as much as for the fact that it uses 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.570
 continuously shooting 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.369
 and yes even a fairly inmate 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.520
 annoying then to avoid doing 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.720
 very long parts I will use the only master 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.460
 ball that I have available 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 because anyway from what I read is 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.390
 also from the advice you gave me 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.920
 no other pokemon is needed 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.300
 because deoxys is the only one who gives 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120
 quite a hard time 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.160
 as for the weakening as 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 already said because of recovery and in the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.690
 capture for his hateful cap trade 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.130
 so I rely on your advice 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.170
 I entrust to what I read online 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.209
 in case there is any legendary one 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.890
 more difficult to capture later 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.630
 I will make myself a reason I will try to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.390
 take it with the ultravole with any 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.890
 other bubbles the master ball I want to use it 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.890
 for deoxys usa 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:03.560
 123 and now no, of course I wouldn't have been 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:05.540
 just don't know bad luck dell hard e 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.680
 we insert the data of deoxys inside 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.329
 of pokédex registration completed on 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.909
 DNA of a space virus has suffered 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.489
 a sudden mutation later 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.769
 at the exhibition exposure because I have 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.810
 bed exposure be has a laser beam 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.239
 this gave birth to the oc you shoot 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.040
 that the crystalline organ on his chest 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.980
 make up the brain this is not it 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.659
 I knew a psychic high one meter e 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.310
 seventy and heavy 60.8 kg sightings 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.919
 two in fact this is the second time 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.459
 that we see it we can zoom in on 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:46.220
 he to zoom it or rotate it 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.519
 this pokédex let's hear the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.519
 to 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.479
 we don't give a nickname boxes of course 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.530
 and now we're going to try the cake 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:10.959
 of the deserted skies really does 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 impression but very ok we try deoxys 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.320
 in this herb it is not exactly the best 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.829
 there are pokémon type of level 2 3 4 al 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.829
 maximum 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.849
 here's level 2 dealing with a tea 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.400
 office all 80 doesn't have to be much 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.620
 correct however who cares we try 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.889
 use a psycho launch psycho momentum 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.270
 in fact without pity wow I would never be me 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.229
 waited for it to have sent it down 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.080
 minus a stroke no I have to say no 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:49.110
 one then you must fall without mercy on 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.919
 radius more avoided the attack 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:58.159
 Oh God how it was possible he avoided 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.159
 I don't believe the attack, I don't believe it 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:11.039
 ok ok this time you die but it seems to me 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:12.690
 ok ok guys and that was all 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.639
 what I had to show you in this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.169
 part I hope I have been helpful 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.090
 at least for those who had asked me 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.639
 how to find the oc sis the second time 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.500
 and nothing in the next part there 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.669
 we will start to do this extra things 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.789
 once I promise you 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.620
 and we will head towards I don't know if maybe 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.139
 the neo alghe pauly strain to take the 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.479
 motor ship tide for this part everything 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.479
 See you next time and bye bye
