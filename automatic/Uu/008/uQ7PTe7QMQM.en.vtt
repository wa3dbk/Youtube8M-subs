recently at Google i/o 2013 we gave a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550 
recently at Google i/o 2013 we gave a
talk<00:00:14.400> called<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.269> moving<00:00:15.570> experience<00:00:15.839> which

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
talk called a moving experience which

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.519 
talk called a moving experience which
was<00:00:16.710> about<00:00:16.949> various<00:00:17.279> animation<00:00:17.820> techniques

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
was about various animation techniques

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
was about various animation techniques
and<00:00:19.529> capabilities<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.910> Android<00:00:21.359> platform

and<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.279> techniques<00:00:23.609> centered

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and a lot of these techniques centered

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
and a lot of these techniques centered
around<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> principles<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
around some of the principles of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.849 
around some of the principles of
animation<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.939> early<00:00:27.630> cartoon<00:00:28.349> animators

animation that early cartoon animators
came<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> talk<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
came up with and I want to talk about a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
came up with and I want to talk about a
couple<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.019> those<00:00:31.109> briefly<00:00:31.619> today<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
couple of those briefly today one is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.080 
couple of those briefly today one is
anticipation<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:35.090> over

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
anticipation and the other is over

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389 
anticipation and the other is over
shooting<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.600> follow-through<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> these

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
shooting or follow-through and these

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.740 
shooting or follow-through and these
techniques<00:00:38.760> along<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> host<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> other

techniques along with a host of other

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.040 
techniques along with a host of other
techniques<00:00:40.710> are<00:00:40.860> used<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.370> help<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.270> users<00:00:42.750> in

techniques are used to help the users in
their<00:00:43.320> case<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.129> viewers<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.820> cartoons

their case the viewers of these cartoons

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
their case the viewers of these cartoons
very<00:00:46.020> quickly<00:00:46.410> understand<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.399> going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
very quickly understand what was going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.560 
very quickly understand what was going
on<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> screen<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.300> very<00:00:48.480> few

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
on in the screen they had very few

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020 
on in the screen they had very few
frames<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.530> sometimes<00:00:50.280> 24<00:00:50.760> frames

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
frames to work with sometimes 24 frames

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.139 
frames to work with sometimes 24 frames
a<00:00:51.180> second<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:52.110> more<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.500> 12<00:00:53.399> frames

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a second or actually more like 12 frames

a second or actually more like 12 frames
a<00:00:54.270> second<00:00:54.600> maybe<00:00:54.719> even<00:00:55.050> eight<00:00:55.289> six<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.860> eight

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a second maybe even eight six or eight

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
a second maybe even eight six or eight
frames<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> second<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.449> wasn't<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
frames a second so there wasn't a lot of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
frames a second so there wasn't a lot of
time<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.260> any<00:00:58.379> particular<00:00:58.590> second<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
time in any particular second to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
time in any particular second to
understand<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> action<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> mean<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> actions

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
understand the action I mean the actions

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
understand the action I mean the actions
would<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.559> happen<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.129> quickly<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
would would happen really quickly and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
would would happen really quickly and
they<00:01:03.840> needed<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> users<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> locked<00:01:05.400> onto

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
they needed the users to be locked onto

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
they needed the users to be locked onto
with<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> action<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> cartoon

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
with the action in the cartoon

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
with the action in the cartoon
constantly<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:09.030> missed<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
constantly because if they missed it it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.260 
constantly because if they missed it it
was<00:01:09.600> gone<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.200> didn't<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.560> time<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
was gone and they didn't have time to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.490 
was gone and they didn't have time to
rewind<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.720> had<00:01:12.840> happened<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
rewind and see what had happened so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
rewind and see what had happened so
instead<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.920> gave<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.280> many<00:01:14.549> indications

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
instead they gave as many indications

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.440 
instead they gave as many indications
and<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.350> aids<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> user<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.790> possible<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and and aids to the user as possible to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.789 
and and aids to the user as possible to
the<00:01:18.540> viewer<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.020> possible<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.710> they

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the viewer as possible so that they

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
the viewer as possible so that they
could<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.220> clue<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.360> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
could really clue into what was going on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.320 
could really clue into what was going on
but<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> same<00:01:22.890> problems<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.150> some

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but we have the same problems to some

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
but we have the same problems to some
extent<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> user<00:01:25.170> interfaces<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:25.950> you

really<00:01:26.400> need<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.700> users<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.600> understand

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
really need the users to understand

for<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.770> application<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
for your application so that they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399 
for your application so that they
understand<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.270> flow<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.750> well<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.200> did

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
understand that flow as well as you did

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.170 
understand that flow as well as you did
when<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> wrote<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> incredibly<00:01:53.729> complex

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
when you wrote that incredibly complex

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389 
when you wrote that incredibly complex
UI<00:01:54.509> well<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.799> use<00:01:55.950> some<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
UI well if you can use some of the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.410 
UI well if you can use some of the
techniques<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.030> came<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.270> with

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
techniques that they came up with

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
techniques that they came up with
cartoons<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.590> maybe<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.159> help<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
cartoons then maybe you can help the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
cartoons then maybe you can help the
users<00:01:59.850> understand<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.380> interactions<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
users understand the interactions that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
users understand the interactions that
they're<00:02:02.250> having<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:03.149> application<00:02:03.750> as

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
they're having with your application as

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
they're having with your application as
well<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.229> help<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.560> understand<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
well and help them understand and be

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.350 
well and help them understand and be
more<00:02:06.060> productive<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.689> your<00:02:06.810> application

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
more productive with your application

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.690 
more productive with your application
the<00:02:07.420> same<00:02:07.600> time<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:09.070> sometimes<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.580> little

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
the same time so it's sometimes a little

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.310 
the same time so it's sometimes a little
bit<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.030> stretch<00:02:10.240> between<00:02:10.450> these<00:02:10.780> cartoony

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
bit of a stretch between these cartoony

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.070 
bit of a stretch between these cartoony
effects<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:12.550> maybe<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> effects<00:02:13.930> that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
effects and maybe the effects that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.330 
effects and maybe the effects that
you're<00:02:14.170> looking<00:02:14.410> for<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.680> your<00:02:14.710> application

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you're looking for in your application

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.520 
you're looking for in your application
but<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.210> possible<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.780> sort<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.140> connect

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
but it is possible to sort of connect

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.840 
but it is possible to sort of connect
these<00:02:17.590> dots<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.100> say<00:02:18.220> okay<00:02:18.460> given<00:02:18.760> this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
these dots and say okay given this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.760 
these dots and say okay given this
technique<00:02:19.300> what<00:02:19.750> they<00:02:19.840> were<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.260> how

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
technique what they were going for how

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620 
technique what they were going for how
could<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.040> actually<00:02:21.310> apply<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.210> technique

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
could we actually apply that technique

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.570 
could we actually apply that technique
if<00:02:22.810> maybe<00:02:23.230> not<00:02:23.470> make<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.740> quite<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.100> cartoony

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
if maybe not make it quite as cartoony

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.210 
if maybe not make it quite as cartoony
in<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> business<00:02:25.030> context<00:02:25.510> anyway<00:02:26.260> let's<00:02:27.070> see

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
in the business context anyway let's see

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.610 
in the business context anyway let's see
the<00:02:27.340> actual<00:02:27.670> demo<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.080> demo<00:02:29.350> here

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the actual demo so we have a demo here

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350 
the actual demo so we have a demo here
called<00:02:29.890> live<00:02:30.100> button<00:02:30.430> if<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.000> click<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
called live button if you click the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.220 
called live button if you click the
button<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:33.160> button<00:02:33.190> interacts<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.990> there's<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
button the button interacts so there's a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.840 
button the button interacts so there's a
couple<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.620> different<00:02:35.920> interesting<00:02:36.400> elements

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
couple of different interesting elements

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.000 
couple of different interesting elements
to<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.110> anticipation<00:02:38.740> where

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
to this one is the anticipation where

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.260 
to this one is the anticipation where
when<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> click<00:02:39.550> on<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.760> button<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.090> gets

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
when you click on the button it gets

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.050 
when you click on the button it gets
smaller<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.930> when<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.950> release<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> button

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
smaller and when you release the button

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.000 
smaller and when you release the button
it<00:02:43.540> doesn't<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.170> return<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.530> its<00:02:44.830> previous

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
it doesn't just return to its previous

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.100 
it doesn't just return to its previous
state<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.030> overshoots<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.870> swings

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
state but it overshoots that and swings

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.440 
state but it overshoots that and swings
back<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.160> anticipation<00:02:48.910> as<00:02:49.270> it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
back so this is the anticipation as it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.720 
back so this is the anticipation as it
presses<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.230> then<00:02:50.800> it's<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.250> overshoot

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
presses in and then it's the overshoot

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
presses in and then it's the overshoot
as<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.780> actually<00:02:53.080> comes<00:02:53.290> back<00:02:53.500> not<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
as it actually comes back not just to

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.380 
as it actually comes back not just to
its<00:02:54.280> original<00:02:54.370> position<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.090> actually

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
its original position that actually

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.479 
its original position that actually
passed<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.870> there's<00:02:56.800> some<00:02:57.070> interesting

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
passed it there's some interesting

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.060 
passed it there's some interesting
aspects<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.590> makes<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
aspects to this one is that it makes the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160 
aspects to this one is that it makes the
objects<00:03:00.640> feel<00:03:00.880> more<00:03:01.270> organic<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.050> natural

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
objects feel more organic and natural

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.830 
objects feel more organic and natural
and<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.010> also<00:03:03.160> makes<00:03:03.489> them<00:03:03.610> more<00:03:03.850> engaging<00:03:04.540> in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and it also makes them more engaging in

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.050 
and it also makes them more engaging in
general<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.350> saw<00:03:05.709> techniques<00:03:06.190> specifically

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
general I saw techniques specifically

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.510 
general I saw techniques specifically
like<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.570> on<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> game<00:03:08.500> console<00:03:08.920> years<00:03:09.250> ago

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
like this on a game console years ago

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.729 
like this on a game console years ago
and<00:03:09.730> whether<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.420> buttons<00:03:10.690> were<00:03:10.810> pressed<00:03:11.080> in

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
and whether the buttons were pressed in

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.050 
and whether the buttons were pressed in
when<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.040> clicked<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.400> them<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:12.790> actually

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
when you clicked on them or actually

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.250 
when you clicked on them or actually
popped<00:03:13.360> out<00:03:13.570> when<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.810> clicked<00:03:14.019> on<00:03:14.170> them

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
popped out when you clicked on them

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.140 
popped out when you clicked on them
actually<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:15.100> interaction<00:03:15.549> didn't<00:03:16.000> matter

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
actually that interaction didn't matter

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.729 
actually that interaction didn't matter
what<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.420> noticed<00:03:16.810> was<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.470> buttons

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
what I noticed was that the buttons

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.289 
what I noticed was that the buttons
themselves<00:03:17.860> were<00:03:18.280> much<00:03:18.549> more<00:03:18.730> engaging<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
themselves were much more engaging and

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.000 
themselves were much more engaging and
this<00:03:19.810> was<00:03:19.959> really<00:03:20.110> important<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.830> game

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
this was really important in the game

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.130 
this was really important in the game
context<00:03:21.730> where<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.390> really<00:03:22.660> want<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> whole

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
context where you really want the whole

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.960 
context where you really want the whole
experience<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.070> more<00:03:24.370> fun<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.850> engaging

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
experience to be more fun and engaging

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.539 
experience to be more fun and engaging
to<00:03:25.299> begin<00:03:25.630> with<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.620> helps<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> user<00:03:27.250> feel

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
to begin with and it helps the user feel

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.009 
to begin with and it helps the user feel
like<00:03:27.730> they're<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:27.970> interacting<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.900> the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
like they're really interacting with the

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.780 
like they're really interacting with the
machine<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.590> game<00:03:29.769> instead<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.549> just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
machine in the game instead of just

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.330 
machine in the game instead of just
clicking<00:03:31.000> buttons<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.750> user<00:03:31.930> interface<00:03:32.340> so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
clicking buttons in a user interface so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130 
clicking buttons in a user interface so
the<00:03:33.549> way<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:34.030> these<00:03:34.120> effects<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.690> very

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the way to get these effects is very

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.250 
the way to get these effects is very
simple<00:03:35.530> we'll<00:03:36.280> see<00:03:36.430> some<00:03:36.580> more<00:03:36.610> complex

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
simple we'll see some more complex

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.180 
simple we'll see some more complex
applications<00:03:38.260> these<00:03:38.410> techniques<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.040> other

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
applications these techniques and other

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.759 
applications these techniques and other
demos<00:03:39.580> but<00:03:40.030> in<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.299> particular<00:03:41.049> application

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
demos but in this particular application

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.910 
demos but in this particular application
it's<00:03:42.430> very<00:03:42.820> simple<00:03:43.120> I'm<00:03:43.450> not<00:03:43.690> actually

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
it's very simple I'm not actually

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.380 
it's very simple I'm not actually
handling<00:03:44.920> click<00:03:45.190> events<00:03:45.489> here<00:03:45.670> all<00:03:45.850> I'm<00:03:46.060> doing

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
handling click events here all I'm doing

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.080 
handling click events here all I'm doing
is<00:03:46.650> tracking<00:03:47.650> up-and-down<00:03:48.370> events<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:48.880> then

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
is tracking up-and-down events and then

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.970 
is tracking up-and-down events and then
making<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.900> button<00:03:50.110> look<00:03:50.320> differently<00:03:50.830> I'm

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
making the button look differently I'm

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.820 
making the button look differently I'm
letting<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.549> superclass<00:03:51.910> actually<00:03:52.450> track

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
letting the superclass actually track

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.110 
letting the superclass actually track
track<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.310> clicks<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.820> motion

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
track the the clicks and the motion

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.310 
track the the clicks and the motion
events<00:03:55.360> because<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.660> don't<00:03:55.840> care<00:03:56.019> about<00:03:56.110> that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
events because I don't care about that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.020 
events because I don't care about that
all<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.590> care<00:03:56.890> about<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.220> make<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.820> button

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
all I care about is make the button

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.390 
all I care about is make the button
smaller<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.600> make<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.870> button<00:03:59.220> larger<00:04:00.220> to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
smaller and make the button larger to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.729 
smaller and make the button larger to
overshoot<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.390> we<00:04:01.870> make<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.170> smaller<00:04:02.440> by

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
overshoot so we make it smaller by

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.590 
overshoot so we make it smaller by
grabbing<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.370> view<00:04:03.579> property<00:04:04.000> animator<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
grabbing a view property animator on the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.479 
grabbing a view property animator on the
button<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:05.440> say<00:04:05.590> click<00:04:05.950> my<00:04:06.100> button<00:04:06.130> dot

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
button so we say click my button dot

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.240 
button so we say click my button dot

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
animates we set the interpolator to this

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.860 
animates we set the interpolator to this

that<00:04:13.450> we<00:04:13.510> defined<00:04:13.870> above<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.650> means<00:04:14.920> that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that we defined above this means that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.320 
that we defined above this means that
we're<00:04:15.190> going<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.370> start<00:04:15.670> fast<00:04:15.910> when<00:04:16.209> they

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
we're going to start fast when they

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.280 
we're going to start fast when they
click<00:04:16.510> on<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.780> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
click on it and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.690 
click on it and
slow<00:04:17.530> down<00:04:17.710> toward<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.100> end<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.580> it's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
slow down toward the end and it's

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.890 
slow down toward the end and it's
important<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.090> start<00:04:19.390> fast<00:04:19.540> because<00:04:19.840> you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
important to start fast because you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.420 
important to start fast because you
don't<00:04:20.050> want<00:04:20.200> them<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.440> hit<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.070> button<00:04:21.220> and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
don't want them to hit the button and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.250 
don't want them to hit the button and
then<00:04:21.520> get<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:21.820> sluggish<00:04:22.630> feeling<00:04:23.020> as<00:04:23.110> it

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
then get this sluggish feeling as it

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.990 
then get this sluggish feeling as it
accelerates<00:04:23.680> into<00:04:24.130> an<00:04:24.280> animation<00:04:24.610> instead

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
accelerates into an animation instead

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.450 
accelerates into an animation instead
you<00:04:25.090> want<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.750> start<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.290> quickly<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
you want it to start really quickly and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.090 
you want it to start really quickly and
possibly<00:04:28.150> slow<00:04:28.420> down<00:04:28.600> at<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.780> ends<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.920> the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
possibly slow down at the ends but the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.790 
possibly slow down at the ends but the
the<00:04:30.310> main<00:04:30.580> element<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.090> want<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.620> actually<00:04:32.620> to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
the main element you want is actually to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.170 
the main element you want is actually to
you<00:04:33.010> wanted<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.310> start<00:04:33.580> really<00:04:33.700> quickly<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
you wanted to start really quickly and

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.490 
you wanted to start really quickly and
you<00:04:34.240> want<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.570> be<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.690> very<00:04:35.020> short<00:04:35.350> duration

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
you want it to be a very short duration

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.190 
you want it to be a very short duration
as<00:04:35.950> well<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.940> we<00:04:37.060> use<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.210> decelerate<00:04:37.870> er<00:04:37.900> here

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
as well so we use a decelerate er here

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.610 
as well so we use a decelerate er here
and<00:04:39.480> notice<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.660> actually<00:04:40.930> change<00:04:41.410> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
and notice that I actually change the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
and notice that I actually change the
duration<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.100> view<00:04:42.250> property<00:04:42.610> animator

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
duration of the view property animator

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.820 
duration of the view property animator
to<00:04:43.060> 200<00:04:43.540> instead<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:43.900> its<00:04:44.020> default<00:04:44.350> 300

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
to 200 instead of its default 300

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.260 
to 200 instead of its default 300
because<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.370> wanted<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.730> animation<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.240> be

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
because I wanted the animation to be

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.450 
because I wanted the animation to be
very<00:04:46.660> quick<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.500> we<00:04:47.590> set<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> decelerate<00:04:48.430> er

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
very quick so we set the decelerate er

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.100 
very quick so we set the decelerate er
and<00:04:48.760> then<00:04:48.910> we<00:04:49.000> simply<00:04:49.330> scaled<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.810> button<00:04:50.050> so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
and then we simply scaled the button so

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.450 
and then we simply scaled the button so
we're<00:04:50.230> going<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.380> animate<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.890> scale<00:04:51.190> make

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
we're going to animate that scale make

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.430 
we're going to animate that scale make
the<00:04:51.610> button<00:04:51.820> smaller<00:04:52.090> as<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.780> user<00:04:52.960> presses

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
the button smaller as the user presses

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.170 
the button smaller as the user presses
on<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.800> then<00:04:53.950> when<00:04:54.070> they<00:04:54.250> release<00:04:54.640> we're

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
on it and then when they release we're

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.220 
on it and then when they release we're
just<00:04:55.330> going<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.480> do<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.750> same<00:04:55.900> thing<00:04:56.110> in

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
just going to do the same thing in

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.560 
just going to do the same thing in
Reverse<00:04:56.380> we're<00:04:56.770> going<00:04:56.920> to<00:04:57.010> set<00:04:57.490> scale<00:04:57.790> X<00:04:58.240> and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
Reverse we're going to set scale X and

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.470 
Reverse we're going to set scale X and
scale<00:04:58.780> Y<00:04:58.990> animate<00:04:59.530> those<00:04:59.650> back<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.130> one<00:05:00.480> except

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
scale Y animate those back to one except

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.570 
scale Y animate those back to one except
instead<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.990> just<00:05:02.230> animating<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.220> back<00:05:03.400> to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
instead of just animating the back to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.620 
instead of just animating the back to
where<00:05:03.730> they<00:05:03.850> started<00:05:04.180> we're<00:05:04.330> going<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.510> use

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
where they started we're going to use

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.360 
where they started we're going to use
this<00:05:04.810> overshoot<00:05:05.260> interpolator<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:06.280> we

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
this overshoot interpolator that we

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.400 
this overshoot interpolator that we
defined<00:05:06.730> above<00:05:06.970> so<00:05:07.510> it'll<00:05:07.780> actually<00:05:07.870> animate

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
defined above so it'll actually animate

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.470 
defined above so it'll actually animate
past<00:05:08.740> one<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.250> then<00:05:09.370> back<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:10.120> sort<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.360> give

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
past one and then back to sort of give

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.850 
past one and then back to sort of give

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
that organic feeling of actually

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.460 
that organic feeling of actually
