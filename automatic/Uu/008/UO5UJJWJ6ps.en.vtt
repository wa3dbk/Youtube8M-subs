put a screw on this end in this end
where<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> two<00:01:36.150> high<00:01:36.329> spots<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.900> or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
where I know the two high spots are or

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
where I know the two high spots are or
where<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> boards<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.860> hitting<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
where the boards are hitting and then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
where the boards are hitting and then
I'm<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> come<00:01:39.360> behind<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.650> some

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I'm going to come behind it with some

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
I'm going to come behind it with some
shims<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.450> tricky<00:01:45.780> as

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
shims and this is a little bit tricky as

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
shims and this is a little bit tricky as
far<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.259> keeping<00:01:46.590> everything's<00:01:47.040> great<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
far as keeping everything's great you

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.240 
far as keeping everything's great you
don't<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.049> too<00:01:49.049> much<00:01:49.079> pressure<00:01:49.979> on

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
don't want to put too much pressure on

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't want to put too much pressure on
the<00:01:50.460> shims<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.299> basically

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the shims because what you're basically

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.530 
the shims because what you're basically
just<00:01:51.869> trying<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:53.009> create<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> seat<00:01:54.000> for

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
just trying to do is create a seat for

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
just trying to do is create a seat for
this<00:01:54.720> whole<00:01:55.200> thing<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.530> sit<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.070> don't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
this whole thing to sit on you don't

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550 
this whole thing to sit on you don't
want<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.869> rock<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.229> don't<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
want it to rock but you don't want to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.330 
want it to rock but you don't want to
put<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> pressure<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.520> you're

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
put some of the pressure that you're

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.649 
put some of the pressure that you're
changing<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.610> form<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> board<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
changing the form of the board so you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.899 
changing the form of the board so you
want<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> stay<00:02:04.290> nice<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.530> flat<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.790> now

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
want this to stay nice and flat so now

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.190 
want this to stay nice and flat so now
what<00:02:06.030> I'll<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.600> I'll<00:02:06.719> come<00:02:06.869> behind

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
what I'll just do is I'll come behind

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
what I'll just do is I'll come behind
this<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.530> wherever<00:02:07.799> there's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.069> spot<00:02:08.340> that's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this and wherever there's a spot that's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.279 
this and wherever there's a spot that's
a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.330> high<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> go<00:02:10.200> ahead

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a little high I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.320 
a little high I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:10.619> put<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> shim<00:02:11.129> in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and put a shim in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
and put a shim in
and<00:02:12.450> I'll<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.990> by<00:02:13.170> where<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and I'll do that right by where the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.710 
and I'll do that right by where the
screws<00:02:13.710> are<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:15.000> run<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> screw<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.600> on

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
screws are so I can run a screw in on

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.550 
screws are so I can run a screw in on
top<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.110> use<00:02:19.140> smaller

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
top of that and you can use smaller

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
top of that and you can use smaller
shims<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.100> course<00:02:20.310> those<00:02:20.550> are<00:02:20.580> kind<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> big

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
shims of course those are kind of big

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.760 
shims of course those are kind of big
for<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:25.200> will<00:02:25.290> hold<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.530> in

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
for this and that will hold that in

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.590 
for this and that will hold that in
place<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.850> I'll<00:02:26.910> do<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.060> same<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
place and then I'll do the same on the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080 
place and then I'll do the same on the
other<00:02:27.750> side<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.040> 36<00:02:29.640> inch<00:02:29.820> board

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
other side and on this 36 inch board

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.290 
other side and on this 36 inch board
I'll<00:02:30.240> probably<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> couple<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
I'll probably do that in in a couple of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.360 
I'll probably do that in in a couple of
spots<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.170> oak<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.740> huge<00:02:35.100> if

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
spots because it's oak and it's huge if

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.030 
spots because it's oak and it's huge if
it<00:02:35.940> were<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> 3/4<00:02:36.870> inch<00:02:36.900> board<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.770> pine

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it were a 3/4 inch board and it was pine

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.550 
it were a 3/4 inch board and it was pine
or<00:02:38.070> something<00:02:38.580> I'd<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.290> shim<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
or something I'd have to shim it in a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.500 
or something I'd have to shim it in a
few<00:02:40.770> more<00:02:40.890> spots<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.550> want<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.240> sure<00:02:42.360> my

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
few more spots I want to make sure my

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.030 
few more spots I want to make sure my
screw<00:02:42.750> head<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.110> below<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> surface<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
screw head so below the surface but I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.980 
screw head so below the surface but I
don't<00:02:44.280> want<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.850> tighten<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.270> down<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.810> much

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
don't want to tighten this down so much

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.400 
don't want to tighten this down so much
that<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:47.100> know<00:02:47.160> deflecting<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
that it's you know deflecting the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.440 
that it's you know deflecting the
straight<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> board<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:51.150> I'll<00:02:51.300> just

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
straight on the board here and I'll just

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.120 
straight on the board here and I'll just
check<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.990> my<00:02:52.170> eyeball<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
check that with my eyeball and that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.460 
check that with my eyeball and that
looks<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.550> good<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.140> I'm<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.350> go

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
looks really good so I'm going to go

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.620 
looks really good so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> cut<00:02:55.860> these<00:02:56.040> shims<00:02:56.340> off<00:02:56.550> right<00:02:57.450> now

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
ahead and cut these shims off right now

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.850 
ahead and cut these shims off right now
and<00:02:57.660> then<00:02:57.959> I'll<00:02:58.050> run<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.350> through<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> board

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and then I'll run this through the board

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.230 
and then I'll run this through the board
it's<00:02:59.280> run<00:02:59.430> us<00:02:59.550> through<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.730> planer<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.060> show

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
it's run us through the planer and show

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's run us through the planer and show
you<00:03:00.330> out<00:03:00.420> work

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:31.860 

you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:42.790 

you

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.070 

okay<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:43.860> I've<00:03:44.100> got<00:03:44.130> my<00:03:44.430> big<00:03:44.700> wide<00:03:45.210> oak<00:03:45.720> play

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
okay so I've got my big wide oak play

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.590 
okay so I've got my big wide oak play
but<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.710> when<00:03:46.860> I've<00:03:46.980> got<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.310> I've<00:03:47.430> got<00:03:47.490> I<00:03:47.910> want

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
but now when I've got is I've got I want

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320 
but now when I've got is I've got I want
to<00:03:48.720> get<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.900> nice<00:03:49.080> clean<00:03:49.320> edge<00:03:49.440> along<00:03:49.890> here<00:03:50.160> and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
MDF and then I'm going to leave it just

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.090 
MDF and then I'm going to leave it just
a<00:04:06.630> touch<00:04:06.810> proud<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.350> where<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.860> cut<00:04:08.070> it
