very nice so we can slide off the back

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.319 
very nice so we can slide off the back
of<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.350> leaf<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.829> that's<00:01:52.549> how<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:52.759> do<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.909> to

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
of the leaf and that's how we do it to

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:53.859 
of the leaf and that's how we do it to
get<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.540> open

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
get it open

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.340 
get it open
yep<00:01:54.829> slide<00:01:55.220> off<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.400> back<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.320> can

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
yep slide off the back and then we can

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.469 
yep slide off the back and then we can
put<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.680> battery<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:59.979> yep<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.479> that

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
put the battery in yep so that that

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.200 
put the battery in yep so that that
pacing<00:02:03.079> me<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:04.040> get<00:02:04.189> with<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.490> needs<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.970> go<00:02:05.090> in

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
pacing me you get with it needs to go in

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:14.309 
pacing me you get with it needs to go in
now<00:02:05.390> believe

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.520 

in<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.040> battery<00:02:15.489> goes<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.849> first<00:02:19.079> yep<00:02:20.079> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
in that battery goes in first yep and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.280 
in that battery goes in first yep and
then<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.829> clips<00:02:21.099> in<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:26.079> then<00:02:26.260> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
then that clips in like so and then that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:40.349 
then that clips in like so and then that
clicks<00:02:26.799> back<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:31.560> let's<00:02:32.560> turn<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.859> on<00:02:39.359> there

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
clicks back on let's turn it on there

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.030 
clicks back on let's turn it on there
you<00:02:40.389> go

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you go

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.440 
you go
so<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.099> says<00:02:42.250> insert<00:02:42.609> sim<00:02:42.849> will<00:02:42.970> connect<00:02:43.239> via

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
so it says insert sim will connect via

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.559 
so it says insert sim will connect via
bluetooth<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.849> going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.060> connect<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.420> to

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
bluetooth so I'm going to connect it to

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.349 
bluetooth so I'm going to connect it to
my<00:02:46.840> iPhone

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:03:04.069 

here<00:02:52.359> we<00:02:52.510> go<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:57.030> let's<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.299> Bluetooth
