00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 The main character of the letter is a former professional boxer 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.120

 Huge number of letters from prison kept by family of Mr. Ashida training

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 As the same former boxer and the same affair I am now Japan's largest Korea 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.979
 It is driven by the urge to scream out of the deepest cell window 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.690
 There is one former professional boxer who saw this letter 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.039

 This is the only package 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:43.700
 When I wanted to deliver a letter to Carter, I could not stand or stand 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.370
 Sense of tension 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.690
 There all 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.560

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:33.190
 Because I saw a pair of eyes 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.290
 Finally in Toronto I met Mr. Carter and I received a letter from Shibata 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:42.790
 I was able to hand it over 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:47.560
 He is earnestly sound even in wars and earns me the money that makes me sound over the country and across the sea 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.640

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.579
 up 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:25.580
 Mr. Tokuhisa's letter was also delivered by the story of Mr. Hideko of Shida's death penalty sister 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:30.740
 It is said that nothing has been transmitted to Mr. Shibata's death prisoner that the reply came from Mr. shoulder 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.370
 The next time I go to the meeting, I would like to give a letter from Carter. 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.639
