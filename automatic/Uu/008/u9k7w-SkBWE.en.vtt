 and the grapes were collecting dust very well despite 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.439
 on very frequent rains the beginning of summer here 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:30.080
 today is June 17 or 18 every other day 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:34.790
 almost rain and the end of the end of spring 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.790
 what was wet 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:45.879
 this is arcade here will have more 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:52.260
 normalize the void of clusters

 transfiguration 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 despite the constant rains on the leaves 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:12.790
 no hint of illness my experiment 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.159
 this whole season goes on processing 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.340
 only microbiological preparations and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.680
 feed up 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 and process this microbiological 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:37.110
 Baikal EM1 fertilizer its derivative 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 drug m5 here it is baikal em1 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.329
 m5 drugs to protect against pests and 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.469
 diseases 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 preparing independently with 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:55.520
 using baikal em1 also 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 periodically add when spraying 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.399
 microbiological preparation of 3 plant 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 for protection 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.170
 vineyard but also other plants from 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:17.340
 fungus-based pathogens 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 milldue a and dima and various root 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:37.760
 so far experiment 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 manages to glory season abnormally wet 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.470
 but diseases in the vineyard 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.450
 not noticed by the way a neighbor across the street 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.880
 treats with chemicals 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.440
 of protection 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.750
 what can I say about his treatments 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 normal sheet flooring stands without 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.440
 diseases 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.879
 pests in the vineyard he, too, I 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.569
 I did not notice and this is Victor 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:18.890
 but chemicals are chemicals 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.170
 means they are harmful both to humans 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.420
 spraying time as well as 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.030
 using 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.890
 berries and fruits are food besides chemical 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:40.090
 protective equipment does not destroy only 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.090
 harmful microflora but also useful and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.610
 insects beneficial and mites and beneficial 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.849
 microorganisms 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.849
 that is, everything and everything is destroyed 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:05.330
 that is, to organic products 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:09.110
 here is very, very far sooner even 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:13.129
 infinitely far therefore your right 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.190
 choose of course I did not apply 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.970
 microbiological preparations as they say 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.590
 with kondachka 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:25.310
 so I decided and suddenly I started though 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.180
 will take more time i approached this 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.310
 gradually, that is, a few years no longer 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.979
 I dig the earth also a few years 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.050
 I sow using green fertilizer 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.410
 there are siderats 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.460
 as sideratov use mustard 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.789
 young 3 of 4 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.680
 just the same and I do not remember using the m 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:54.340
 compost but chemical fertilizers applied 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.740
 all this time until this season and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.530
 fertilizer remedies this year 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.180
 apply as a fertilizer like me 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.349
 spoke baikal em1 and as a means 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.930
 protect him 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:18.280
 and its derivatives of the drug m 5 as well 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 3 plan on the left above you see a reference 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.900
 how to start using and apply on 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.289
 their plots 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.410
 microbiologically preparations how to go 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:35.380
 on organic cultivation 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.500
 products on your site use 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.750
 recommend 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:46.660
 but already grown up with a fork 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:50.210
 which I did a bush stamp in the fall 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.810
 recently showed shoots at all 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.810
 little ones 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.340
 and here my cucumbers are also fertilized and 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.110
 watered 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:08.480
 I am very pleased with Baikal EM1 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.870
 using microbiological 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:18.220
 drugs baikal em1 on the site is very 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:24.550
 very, very all plants are green 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:27.670
 fresh and healthy it can be seen even by 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.670
 appearance 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:40.440
 This is sturdy raspberry standard 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.440
 starts to ripen
