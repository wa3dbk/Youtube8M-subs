00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
entire loom this will be different from

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.779 
entire loom this will be different from
standard<00:00:37.630> like<00:00:38.230> double<00:00:38.680> knitting<00:00:38.890> analog

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
standard like double knitting analog

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.669 
standard like double knitting analog
loom<00:00:40.090> because<00:00:40.329> you're<00:00:41.050> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.350> going<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.649> be

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
loom because you're kind of going to be

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.639 
loom because you're kind of going to be
using<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.190> loom<00:00:42.789> as<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.480> round<00:00:43.780> loom<00:00:44.140> instead

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
using this loom as a round loom instead

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.970 
using this loom as a round loom instead
of<00:00:44.769> as<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:45.219> long<00:00:45.460> loop<00:00:46.559> once<00:00:47.559> I've<00:00:47.739> done<00:00:47.920> that

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
of as a long loop once I've done that

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.049 
of as a long loop once I've done that
I'm<00:00:48.280> just<00:00:48.489> gonna<00:00:48.609> go<00:00:48.730> ahead<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:48.940> take<00:00:49.030> my

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
I'm just gonna go ahead and take my

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.180 
I'm just gonna go ahead and take my
fingers<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.989> push<00:00:50.199> those<00:00:50.410> loose<00:00:50.649> down<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
fingers and push those loose down to the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.310 
fingers and push those loose down to the
bottom<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.730> peg<00:00:51.969> if<00:00:52.269> your<00:00:52.809> fingers<00:00:53.170> are

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
bottom of the peg if your fingers are

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.020 
bottom of the peg if your fingers are
thicker<00:00:53.649> than<00:00:53.859> mine<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.280> may<00:00:54.460> need<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.730> find<00:00:54.910> a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
thicker than mine you may need to find a

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.750 
thicker than mine you may need to find a
different<00:00:55.420> method<00:00:55.870> for<00:00:56.559> pushing<00:00:57.219> those<00:00:57.429> loops

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
different method for pushing those loops

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.689 
different method for pushing those loops
down<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.480> bottom<00:00:58.899> I<00:00:59.559> suggest<00:01:00.280> using<00:01:00.429> your

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
down to the bottom I suggest using your

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.060 
down to the bottom I suggest using your
purple<00:01:01.030> hook<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.510> laying<00:01:02.079> it<00:01:02.320> across<00:01:02.469> each

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
purple hook and laying it across each

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.060 
purple hook and laying it across each
row<00:01:03.519> of<00:01:03.550> pegs<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:04.440> kind<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.530> using<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:05.860> just<00:01:05.890> to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
row of pegs and kind of using it just to

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.910 
row of pegs and kind of using it just to
push<00:01:06.310> them<00:01:06.490> down<00:01:06.730> like<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.620> then<00:01:08.620> I'm<00:01:08.740> just

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
push them down like so then I'm just

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.040 
push them down like so then I'm just
going<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.070> go<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.340> take<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.550> bottom<00:01:09.850> loops<00:01:10.720> on

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
going to go and take the bottom loops on

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.370 
going to go and take the bottom loops on
my<00:01:11.409> pegs<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.280> pull<00:01:12.640> them<00:01:12.850> over<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.270> top<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
my pegs and pull them over the top the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.639 
my pegs and pull them over the top the
doing<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.340> pegs<00:01:15.759> for<00:01:16.570> any<00:01:16.990> kind<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.409> step

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
doing the in pegs for any kind of step

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.350 
doing the in pegs for any kind of step
in<00:01:17.799> this<00:01:17.890> process<00:01:18.130> will<00:01:18.759> be<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.939> little<00:01:19.149> bit

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
in this process will be a little bit

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.380 
in this process will be a little bit
more<00:01:19.570> awkward<00:01:19.840> since<00:01:20.680> there's<00:01:20.920> only<00:01:21.189> one<00:01:21.790> peg

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
more awkward since there's only one peg

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.080 
more awkward since there's only one peg
on<00:01:22.630> about<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.740> side<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.430> loop<00:01:24.640> if<00:01:24.909> that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
on about that side of the loop if that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:39.300 
on about that side of the loop if that
makes<00:01:25.299> sense

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.710 

all<00:01:40.310> right<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:40.730> once<00:01:40.880> again<00:01:41.000> I'm<00:01:41.210> just<00:01:41.420> taking

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
all right so once again I'm just taking

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.450 
all right so once again I'm just taking
those<00:01:41.900> loops<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.530> putting<00:01:42.740> them<00:01:42.890> down<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
those loops and putting them down to the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.500 
those loops and putting them down to the
bottom<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.970> my<00:01:44.270> peg<00:01:48.940> all<00:01:49.940> right<00:01:50.060> once<00:01:50.210> again

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
bottom of my peg all right once again

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.330 
bottom of my peg all right once again
I'm<00:01:50.690> just<00:01:50.870> gonna<00:01:51.020> go<00:01:51.200> an<00:01:51.290> e-wrap<00:01:51.770> around<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
I'm just gonna go an e-wrap around the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.900 
I'm just gonna go an e-wrap around the
entire<00:01:52.940> spot<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:54.140> my<00:01:54.350> loop<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:55.460> may<00:01:55.580> notice

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
entire spot of my loop you may notice

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.750 
entire spot of my loop you may notice
that<00:01:55.970> I'm<00:01:56.180> starting<00:01:56.900> by<00:01:57.110> each<00:01:57.380> row<00:01:57.800> or<00:01:58.460> where<00:01:58.730> I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
that I'm starting by each row or where I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.030 
that I'm starting by each row or where I
started<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> was<00:01:59.960> at<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.440> central<00:02:00.860> knob

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
started it was at that central knob

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.280 
started it was at that central knob
that's<00:02:01.340> where<00:02:01.550> I<00:02:01.580> recommend<00:02:02.210> starting<00:02:02.930> it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
that's where I recommend starting it

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.620 
that's where I recommend starting it
because<00:02:03.800> it's<00:02:04.100> close<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.970> central<00:02:05.420> knob

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
because it's close to that central knob

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.560 
because it's close to that central knob
so<00:02:05.900> it's<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.229> be<00:02:06.290> easy<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:07.240> your<00:02:08.240> yarn

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
so it's going to be easy for your yarn

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.100 
so it's going to be easy for your yarn
to<00:02:08.929> attach<00:02:09.170> there<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.520> slipknot

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.260 

alright<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.740> once<00:02:16.160> again<00:02:16.370> I'm<00:02:16.790> going<00:02:17.150> to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
alright for the once again I'm going to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.970 
alright for the once again I'm going to
just<00:02:17.420> take<00:02:17.900> those<00:02:18.050> bottom<00:02:18.410> loops<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> put

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
just take those bottom loops and put

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.280 
just take those bottom loops and put
them<00:02:19.100> over<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.400> top<00:02:19.580> now<00:02:20.480> I've<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.840> done

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
them over the top now I've got it done

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.140 
them over the top now I've got it done
this<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:21.709> about<00:02:21.830> 12<00:02:22.220> more<00:02:22.340> rows<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:22.880> I've<00:02:22.970> just

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this for about 12 more rows so I've just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.600 
this for about 12 more rows so I've just
been<00:02:23.270> knitting<00:02:23.570> for<00:02:23.600> actually<00:02:24.590> sorry<00:02:24.740> 14<00:02:25.280> rows

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
been knitting for actually sorry 14 rows

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.970 
been knitting for actually sorry 14 rows
now<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.420> you're<00:02:26.630> working<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.170> around<00:02:27.440> little<00:02:27.800> I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
now if you're working on around little I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.160 
now if you're working on around little I
would<00:02:28.160> suggest<00:02:28.370> doing<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.880> for<00:02:29.090> 12<00:02:29.330> rows<00:02:29.660> but

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
would suggest doing it for 12 rows but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.810 
would suggest doing it for 12 rows but
now<00:02:30.290> I'm<00:02:30.380> going<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.680> doing<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.010> for<00:02:31.190> 14<00:02:31.610> rows

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
now I'm going to be doing it for 14 rows

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.730 
now I'm going to be doing it for 14 rows
and<00:02:32.120> as<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.690> saw<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:32.990> took<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.350> Slipknot

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
and as you saw I just took my Slipknot

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.030 
and as you saw I just took my Slipknot
off<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.520> central<00:02:35.180> knob<00:02:35.480> um<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.860> reason

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
off of that central knob um the reason

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.759 
off of that central knob um the reason
for<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> two<00:02:37.610> extra<00:02:38.060> rows<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:39.170> on

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
for the two extra rows is because on

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.759 
for the two extra rows is because on
this<00:02:40.489> blue<00:02:41.180> actually<00:02:41.420> has<00:02:41.660> 26<00:02:42.290> pegs

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
this blue actually has 26 pegs

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.670 
this blue actually has 26 pegs
versus<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.580> round<00:02:43.970> looms<00:02:44.239> only<00:02:44.660> have<00:02:44.750> 24<00:02:45.320> pegs

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
versus the round looms only have 24 pegs

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.009 
versus the round looms only have 24 pegs
so<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.060> extra<00:02:47.510> width<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.930> want

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
so because of that extra width you want

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.810 
so because of that extra width you want
to<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.560> bit<00:02:48.739> longer<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.670> can

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
to make it a little bit longer you can

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.090 
to make it a little bit longer you can
see<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.120> going<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.450> take<00:02:51.019> my<00:02:51.290> rib<00:02:51.890> up

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
see I'm just going to take my rib up

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.130 
see I'm just going to take my rib up
through<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> loom<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.540> will<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.870> kind<00:02:54.080> of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
through the loom this will be kind of

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.590 
through the loom this will be kind of
weird<00:02:54.320> because<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.340> loom<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:55.910> narrow<00:02:56.120> up

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
weird because this loom is so narrow up

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.110 
weird because this loom is so narrow up
but<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.350> really<00:02:57.680> what's<00:02:57.950> best<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.370> making

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
but it's really what's best for making

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.640 
but it's really what's best for making
this<00:02:59.570> brim<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.070> I'm<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.610> tying<00:03:02.150> my<00:03:02.390> yarn<00:03:03.019> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
this brim so I'm just tying my yarn to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.470 
this brim so I'm just tying my yarn to
the<00:03:03.769> central<00:03:04.130> knob<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.610> then<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:05.269> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the central knob and then just like I

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.840 
the central knob and then just like I
would<00:03:05.810> make<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> normal<00:03:06.530> brim<00:03:07.040> I'm<00:03:07.550> going<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
would make a normal brim I'm going to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.440 
would make a normal brim I'm going to
take<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.600> first<00:03:08.930> stitch<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.450> first

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
take the first stitch of the first

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.449 
take the first stitch of the first
stitches<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:12.200> should<00:03:12.380> say<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.800> first<00:03:13.220> row

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
stitches I should say of that first row

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.330 
stitches I should say of that first row
and<00:03:13.750> put<00:03:14.750> them<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.110> their<00:03:15.260> corresponding<00:03:16.040> peg

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
and put them to their corresponding peg

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.920 
and put them to their corresponding peg
on<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.640> loom<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.299> want<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> make<00:03:17.630> sure<00:03:17.660> that

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
on the loom you want to make sure that

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.750 
on the loom you want to make sure that
you<00:03:18.049> get<00:03:18.200> those<00:03:18.380> two<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.890> pegs<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.489> there

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
you get those two in pegs on there

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.210 
you get those two in pegs on there
because<00:03:19.970> if<00:03:20.420> those<00:03:20.930> are<00:03:21.110> somehow<00:03:21.290> off<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.950> will

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
because if those are somehow off it will

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.280 
because if those are somehow off it will
affect<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.940> brim<00:03:23.269> it'll<00:03:23.570> make<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.900> look<00:03:24.110> kind

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
affect the brim it'll make it look kind

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
affect the brim it'll make it look kind
of<00:03:24.410> kind<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.040> weird<00:03:25.220> because<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.700> will<00:03:25.820> be<00:03:26.000> out

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
of kind of weird because it will be out

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.630 
of kind of weird because it will be out
of<00:03:26.989> funk<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.500> make<00:03:27.650> sure<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:27.980> line<00:03:28.220> up<00:03:28.430> each

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
of funk so make sure you line up each

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.759 
of funk so make sure you line up each
one<00:03:28.940> accordingly<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:29.959> easy<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.440> do<00:03:30.590> this

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
one accordingly and it's easy to do this

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.759 
one accordingly and it's easy to do this
by<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.280> matching<00:03:31.910> up<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:33.019> strand<00:03:33.530> with

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
by just matching up that in strand with

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.770 
by just matching up that in strand with
the<00:03:33.920> central<00:03:34.310> lot<00:03:34.459> if<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.820> makes<00:03:35.000> sense<00:03:35.120> once

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
the central lot if that makes sense once

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.660 
the central lot if that makes sense once
again<00:03:36.049> up<00:03:36.230> going<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.739> fast<00:03:37.070> through<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
again up going really fast through the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.950 
again up going really fast through the
making<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.239> hat<00:03:38.480> if

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
making of this hat if

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.350 
making of this hat if
this<00:03:39.050> is<00:03:39.170> your<00:03:39.350> first<00:03:39.620> time<00:03:40.010> making<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.820> hat<00:03:41.330> I

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
this is your first time making a hat I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.390 
this is your first time making a hat I
would<00:03:41.900> suggest<00:03:42.140> checking<00:03:42.530> out<00:03:42.860> my<00:03:43.010> video

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
would suggest checking out my video

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.170 
would suggest checking out my video
which<00:03:43.700> I'm<00:03:43.880> will<00:03:43.910> link<00:03:44.240> here<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.560> below<00:03:46.180> about

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
which I'm will link here and below about

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.660 
which I'm will link here and below about
how<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.390> make<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> loop<00:03:48.080> on<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.380> round<00:03:48.890> loop<00:03:49.190> there

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
how to make a loop on a round loop there

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.120 
how to make a loop on a round loop there
I<00:03:49.700> go<00:03:49.940> into<00:03:50.060> more<00:03:50.360> detail<00:03:50.780> exactly<00:03:50.990> how<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.560> do

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
I go into more detail exactly how to do

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.500 
I go into more detail exactly how to do
this<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:52.640> video<00:03:52.880> I'm<00:03:53.150> basically

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
this but in this video I'm basically

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.960 
this but in this video I'm basically
just<00:03:53.600> going<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.990> be<00:03:54.080> showing<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.470> all

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
just going to be showing you all

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.670 
just going to be showing you all
modifications<00:03:55.970> from<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.780> long<00:03:56.990> loop<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.560> the

fine in order to cut anything off you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.810 
fine in order to cut anything off you
just<00:04:11.480> do<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:12.440> I've<00:04:13.100> at<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.430> end<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:13.730> the

row I just finished my brim I'm going to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.440 
row I just finished my brim I'm going to
go<00:04:15.770> ahead<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:15.980> switch<00:04:16.190> colors<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.120> for

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
go ahead and switch colors so that for

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.500 
the Hat portion I will have a new color
to<00:04:19.580> work<00:04:19.820> with<00:04:21.820> alright<00:04:22.820> so<00:04:23.060> I'm<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.330> going

to work with alright so I'm just going
ahead<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:24.050> just<00:04:24.470> like<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.770> was<00:04:24.980> with<00:04:25.130> that

ahead and just like I was with that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.090 
ahead and just like I was with that
other<00:04:25.310> color<00:04:25.790> I'm<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.510> be<00:04:26.600> wrapping

other color I'm going to be wrapping

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.520 
other color I'm going to be wrapping
across<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.340> entire<00:04:29.330> loop<00:04:31.960> I'm<00:04:32.960> just<00:04:33.260> taking

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
across the entire loop I'm just taking

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.130 
across the entire loop I'm just taking
the<00:04:33.650> same<00:04:34.240> but<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.270> once<00:04:35.480> put<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.780> over<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.110> top

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
the same but I once put it over the top

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.380 
the same but I once put it over the top
for<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.830> first<00:04:37.070> few<00:04:37.310> rows<00:04:37.640> when<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.970> after

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
for the first few rows when you after

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.550 
for the first few rows when you after
you've<00:04:38.510> done<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.720> bread<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.050> may<00:04:39.200> be<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.380> little

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
you've done the bread it may be a little

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.320 
you've done the bread it may be a little
bit<00:04:39.770> tight<00:04:39.980> or<00:04:40.100> weird<00:04:40.460> that's<00:04:40.850> just<00:04:41.210> because

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
bit tight or weird that's just because

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.690 
bit tight or weird that's just because
you<00:04:41.540> switch<00:04:41.840> colors<00:04:42.260> also<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.430> may<00:04:43.550> notice

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
you switch colors also you may notice

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.040 
you switch colors also you may notice
something<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> have<00:04:44.180> another<00:04:44.450> strand<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.870> yarn

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
something to have another strand of yarn

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.900 
something to have another strand of yarn
hanging<00:04:45.320> which<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:46.010> gonna<00:04:46.130> be<00:04:46.250> awkward

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
hanging which is just gonna be awkward

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.790 
hanging which is just gonna be awkward
alright<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:47.900> I've<00:04:47.990> gone<00:04:48.140> ahead<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.560> knitted

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
alright so I've gone ahead and knitted

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
alright so I've gone ahead and knitted
16<00:04:49.730> more<00:04:50.240> rows<00:04:50.570> now<00:04:51.350> with<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.650> normal<00:04:52.250> round

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
16 more rows now with a normal round

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.150 
16 more rows now with a normal round
though<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.330> would<00:04:53.540> only<00:04:53.690> knit<00:04:53.960> 14<00:04:54.560> rows<00:04:54.890> for<00:04:55.130> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
though I would only knit 14 rows for the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.070 
though I would only knit 14 rows for the
Hat<00:04:55.370> but<00:04:55.580> since<00:04:55.850> this<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.300> long<00:04:56.510> loop<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.930> is

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
Hat but since this is a long loop it is

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.360 
Hat but since this is a long loop it is
going<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.350> be<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> little<00:04:57.680> wider<00:04:57.830> I'm<00:04:58.160> knitting

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
going to be a little wider I'm knitting

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.270 
going to be a little wider I'm knitting
16<00:04:59.000> rows<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.810> I'm<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.830> going<00:05:00.950> to<00:05:00.980> go<00:05:01.130> ahead

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
16 rows and I'm just going to go ahead

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.940 
16 rows and I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:05:01.400> cut<00:05:01.640> my<00:05:01.850> yarn<00:05:01.880> at<00:05:02.390> about<00:05:02.630> two<00:05:02.900> feet

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.200 

alright<00:05:06.950> so<00:05:07.130> using<00:05:07.310> my<00:05:07.490> purple<00:05:07.880> hook<00:05:08.030> I'm

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
alright so using my purple hook I'm

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.720 
alright so using my purple hook I'm
going<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.420> take<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:09.350> hat<00:05:09.950> off<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.550> loop

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
going to take the hat off of the loop

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.840 
going to take the hat off of the loop
let<00:05:11.330> me<00:05:11.360> show<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:12.020> close<00:05:12.530> up<00:05:12.830> exactly<00:05:13.550> what

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
let me show you in close up exactly what

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.380 
let me show you in close up exactly what
I'm<00:05:13.970> doing

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
I'm doing

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.780 
I'm doing
all<00:05:14.870> I'm<00:05:15.170> doing<00:05:15.200> is<00:05:15.740> basically<00:05:16.010> looping<00:05:16.610> my

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
all I'm doing is basically looping my

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.510 
all I'm doing is basically looping my
hook<00:05:17.060> through<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.990> working<00:05:18.470> yarn<00:05:18.520> pulling

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
hook through the working yarn pulling

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.990 
hook through the working yarn pulling
the<00:05:19.910> Strand<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.420> yarn<00:05:20.650> over<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:22.310> loop<00:05:22.610> on<00:05:22.820> the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
the Strand of yarn over the loop on the

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.760 
the Strand of yarn over the loop on the
pack<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:23.390> hope<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:23.720> makes<00:05:23.870> sense<00:05:23.990> this<00:05:24.560> is

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
pack I hope that makes sense this is

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.100 
pack I hope that makes sense this is
exactly<00:05:25.220> like<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.610> would<00:05:25.760> be<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.360> do<00:05:26.810> for<00:05:26.840> a

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
exactly like you would be do I do for a

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.910 
exactly like you would be do I do for a
pearl<00:05:27.530> stitch<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.450> um<00:05:29.450> it's<00:05:29.780> just<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.680> same

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
pearl stitch and um it's just the same

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.230 
pearl stitch and um it's just the same
kind<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.250> technique<00:05:31.550> that<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.790> use<00:05:32.030> with<00:05:32.210> that

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
kind of technique that I use with that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.690 
kind of technique that I use with that
round<00:05:32.630> loop<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.110> also<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.920> this<00:05:34.070> doesn't<00:05:34.460> make

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
round loop I also if this doesn't make

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.520 
round loop I also if this doesn't make
sense<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.150> you<00:05:35.240> just<00:05:35.810> go<00:05:35.930> ahead<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.230> thread

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
sense to you just go ahead and thread

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.840 
sense to you just go ahead and thread
your<00:05:36.740> yard<00:05:37.130> into<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.850> large<00:05:38.630> eyed<00:05:39.580> needle<00:05:40.580> and

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
your yard into a large eyed needle and

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.330 
your yard into a large eyed needle and
then

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
then

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.310 
then
take<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.150> off<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.570> way<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:42.990> may<00:05:43.139> be<00:05:43.199> a

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
take it off that way that may be a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.530 
take it off that way that may be a
little<00:05:43.500> bit<00:05:43.680> simpler<00:05:44.040> for<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.490> but<00:05:44.790> this<00:05:45.330> way

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
little bit simpler for you but this way

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.790 
little bit simpler for you but this way
I<00:05:45.570> find<00:05:45.870> more<00:05:46.050> efficient<00:05:46.440> because<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.650> don't

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
I find more efficient because I don't

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.770 
I find more efficient because I don't
have<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:46.980> use<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.160> needle<00:05:47.580> okay<00:05:48.030> once<00:05:48.480> again

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
have to use that needle okay once again

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.629 
have to use that needle okay once again
for<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.169> indepence<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.010> same<00:05:50.250> ways<00:05:50.490> the

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
for the indepence the same ways the

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.000 
for the indepence the same ways the
other<00:05:50.820> peg<00:05:51.090> I'm<00:05:51.810> just<00:05:52.020> showing<00:05:52.320> you<00:05:52.350> so<00:05:52.919> you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
other peg I'm just showing you so you

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.189 
other peg I'm just showing you so you
get<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.250> sense<00:05:53.520> of<00:05:53.639> what<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.850> looks<00:05:54.030> like<00:05:54.270> those

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
get a sense of what it looks like those

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.219 
get a sense of what it looks like those
impacts<00:05:55.650> are<00:05:55.830> kind<00:05:56.130> of<00:05:56.160> weird<00:05:56.600> to<00:05:57.600> work<00:05:57.810> with<00:05:58.080> I

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
impacts are kind of weird to work with I

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.510 
impacts are kind of weird to work with I
don't<00:05:58.290> really<00:05:58.530> like<00:05:58.740> those<00:06:01.130> notice<00:06:02.130> I'm<00:06:02.370> not

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
don't really like those notice I'm not

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.820 
don't really like those notice I'm not
really<00:06:02.669> cinching<00:06:03.360> up<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:04.139> Hat<00:06:04.350> as<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.590> go<00:06:04.770> along

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
really cinching up the Hat as I go along

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.070 
really cinching up the Hat as I go along
like<00:06:05.250> I<00:06:05.370> would<00:06:05.580> with<00:06:05.669> a<00:06:05.729> round<00:06:06.030> loom<00:06:06.300> it's<00:06:06.780> just

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
like I would with a round loom it's just

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.439 
like I would with a round loom it's just
so<00:06:07.380> hard<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.800> do<00:06:08.070> because<00:06:08.310> this<00:06:08.880> loom<00:06:09.150> is<00:06:09.300> so

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
so hard to do because this loom is so

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.420 
so hard to do because this loom is so
narrow<00:06:09.660> so<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.229> wouldn't<00:06:10.710> recommend<00:06:11.100> really

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
narrow so I wouldn't recommend really

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.760 
narrow so I wouldn't recommend really
cinching<00:06:11.910> up<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.210> head<00:06:12.389> until<00:06:12.870> you<00:06:13.139> entirely

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
cinching up the head until you entirely

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.800 
cinching up the head until you entirely
take<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.400> off<00:06:14.550> of<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.090> loom<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:18.570> I've<00:06:18.660> gone

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
take it off of the loom so I've gone

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.930 
take it off of the loom so I've gone
ahead<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.110> done<00:06:19.260> that<00:06:19.590> now<00:06:19.950> so<00:06:20.669> what<00:06:20.820> I'm<00:06:20.910> just

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
ahead and done that now so what I'm just

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.020 
ahead and done that now so what I'm just
gonna<00:06:21.180> do<00:06:21.510> is<00:06:21.780> just<00:06:21.990> tie<00:06:22.290> a<00:06:22.320> knot<00:06:22.710> simply<00:06:23.370> using

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
gonna do is just tie a knot simply using

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.280 
gonna do is just tie a knot simply using
my<00:06:24.060> yarn<00:06:26.330> this<00:06:27.330> will<00:06:27.540> make<00:06:27.660> sure<00:06:27.840> that<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.139> hat

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
my yarn this will make sure that the hat

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.469 
my yarn this will make sure that the hat
doesn't<00:06:28.500> unravel<00:06:28.680> or<00:06:29.280> fall<00:06:29.580> apart<00:06:29.880> at<00:06:30.000> a<00:06:30.270> time

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
doesn't unravel or fall apart at a time

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.540 
doesn't unravel or fall apart at a time
since<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.110> head<00:06:31.290> I<00:06:31.320> made<00:06:31.620> with<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:31.800> 24<00:06:32.310> pegs

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
since the head I made with a 24 pegs

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.550 
since the head I made with a 24 pegs
round<00:06:32.729> loom<00:06:32.880> this<00:06:33.570> is<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.780> head<00:06:34.050> I<00:06:34.080> made<00:06:34.320> with<00:06:34.530> a

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
round loom this is a head I made with a

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.180 
round loom this is a head I made with a
26<00:06:35.490> pegged<00:06:36.360> loom<00:06:36.900> now<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:37.530> can<00:06:37.800> try<00:06:37.919> to<00:06:37.979> see

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
26 pegged loom now you can try to see

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.040 
26 pegged loom now you can try to see
the<00:06:38.310> difference<00:06:38.340> with<00:06:38.760> width<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.539> height

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
the difference with width and height

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.930 
the difference with width and height
them<00:06:40.260> both<00:06:40.470> of<00:06:40.710> these<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.250> it's<00:06:41.610> really

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
them both of these and it's really

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.420 
them both of these and it's really
exaggerated<00:06:42.660> by<00:06:42.750> me<00:06:42.930> doing<00:06:43.080> this<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:44.100> can<00:06:44.220> see

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
exaggerated by me doing this you can see

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.909 
exaggerated by me doing this you can see
how<00:06:44.699> much<00:06:44.850> wider<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.539> second<00:06:46.289> hat<00:06:46.380> really<00:06:46.740> is

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
how much wider that second hat really is

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.250 
how much wider that second hat really is
now<00:06:47.550> on<00:06:47.910> this<00:06:48.270> hat<00:06:48.510> I<00:06:48.720> really<00:06:48.990> should<00:06:49.229> have

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
now on this hat I really should have

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.379 
now on this hat I really should have
made<00:06:49.500> it<00:06:49.530> longer<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:50.039> even<00:06:50.130> go<00:06:50.310> up<00:06:50.370> to<00:06:50.490> 18<00:06:51.060> rows

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
made it longer and even go up to 18 rows

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.909 
made it longer and even go up to 18 rows
for<00:06:51.690> the<00:06:51.720> Hat<00:06:51.870> portion<00:06:52.350> that<00:06:52.770> will
