00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.210
 dere YouTube I'm glad to rent again and bring you here 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.159
 cared for small child 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.900
 Team Deathmatch is played on the A Länder tasks 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.039
 and that does because the PIGS let split with the bar leading 21 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.210
 and in parks Marton pro though high and 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.919
 Winterthur 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.749
 that's my knee Oxnard off 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.610
 then I almost always play on nuclear bomb 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.370
 so of course the farewell tears while 7 11 and 25 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.020
 per year helicopter shooter and the atomic bomb 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.120
 then I'll talk about the tactic ICF mostly uses 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 to achieve a kind of MoMA 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.900
 that once it naturally flank the opponents and wait 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 meet and then really do it 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.220
 not to keep away from the whole team Metz 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.360
 which is simply because where the team at is the most action 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 the kickers are waiting for you 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.100
 and cut e-mails that can clear a kilo 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.030
 And of course you do not want to be so if you want the mothers Eichenzell 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.780
 Fairfield want 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.450
 this year, there were mineralized seven pieces 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.520
 from 0 9 percent higher 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.870
 then you have one over-ers Perry Erhardt 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.760
 mostly in helicopter shots 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.460
 already for sure 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.340
 when you reach the Harrier 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 is tried 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.170
 Wolf tries 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.750
 slow and safe 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 from which comes from the powder to remove 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.640
 to place in a safe 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.730
 yesterday began, according to the words of the Chancellor 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.130
 and actually only a short time before 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.540
 and who would protect the helicopter 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.799
 waiting down there 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.009
 the Bernese until the Harrier way is maybe he still makes two track 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:52.649
 Shall 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.649
 the playful one might like to buy 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.000
 Wise woman Sagittarius should do most of the work then 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.220
 Of course you can also take Spatz the top scorer with the Action at 30 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.260
 but personally I find the helicopter grazed better too 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.639
 anyway reason that achieved 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.570
 is simple 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.969
 too slow 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.229
 I can quickly respond to the bank UBS raised protect 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.849
 that would sometimes fire 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.459
 protect to co or helicopter 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 What are we always interested in if you also have a lot of money 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.419
 mim TuS on cement or rather said 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.199
 the helicopter network protect me the subject interests 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 and I'm also looking forward to cheeky comments 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.949
 here now higher 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.129
 and I said full 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.590
 remove me now 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.799
 slowly to the safe place 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.639
 and at this place Wyss is a Cash &amp; Carry out and sends him 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.639
 there Burch suspect the grids 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.960
 prompt now will not be alone for space 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.200
 where no one can bother me if I have my helicopter 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.209
 Schützenhaus shore 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.669
 Here I say attempts to take no risk and crawl slowly 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.569
 back is not no poet can see anymore 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.269
 &amp; Cie Alsace has 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.299
 certainly left room 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.189
 to wait for the helicopter to protect 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.450
 and if they really have since discovered a lot in it 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.649
 safe place on the way I should not overlook any opponents Sal 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.679
 Do not panic that could come for the Kitzinger soon follows 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:28.549
 Project 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 namely Frankfurt which percent helicopter racks 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.749
 and if the file is moving it is best for you to be Minister 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:41.519
 me pa red dot apparently seem to cover association and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.639
 It's not that the culprits know nationwide 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.199
 and Pietro is 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.199
 Meinhof shows Sagittarius 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.519
 now shoots little red dots 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.309
 what does not have a field 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:59.729
 I agree that in the clack despite the helicopter crashed already strength is 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.309
 every morning on the 2nd 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.449
 simply for the reason 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.600
 Scorer in BlackRock Steyr 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.299
 Tbilisi so funny 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.109
 Trajectory because he always claims to be dueling right 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.189
 that for 45 in the car deadly where 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.340
 no opponent at all 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.889
 and if Black departure in front 2 missiles 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.800
 so that the helicopter is finally down and in October before 2 is not enough 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.849
 only cold and it went around 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.849
 Before that, let's say we have our own facebook page 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.349
 you will succeed in the description 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.349
 We are happy if we stop by 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.439
 because then maybe we will 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.490
 also announced good things there 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.879
 say what they eat 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.879
 Magnificent Quarter of the Earth took just under 40 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.349
 now I have reached my atomic bomb 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.270
 and try startups free for the one opponent after 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.770
 but to catch 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.870
 there had to be stupid 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.919
 Paulding Ewe Kraus 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.969
 that was the time 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.060
 it was a 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.529
 agreed Klein is clear to me now 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.189
 Here you can get the backs 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.680
 and yes, here she is alone 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.839
 Still cramping a chain link fence 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.240
 the Enz Corp the loudest Pierre Brice 2 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.759
 valued with their relationship and thinkers as we ask 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.250
 and blue you should still
