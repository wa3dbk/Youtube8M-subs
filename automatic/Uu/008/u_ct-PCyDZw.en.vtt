00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
don't really necessarily recommend it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420 
don't really necessarily recommend it
for<00:02:43.810> super<00:02:44.810> oily<00:02:45.260> skin<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.860> supposed<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> be

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
for super oily skin it's supposed to be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
for super oily skin it's supposed to be
oil-free<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.020> original<00:02:48.530> formula

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430

I wouldn't recommend for oily skin
either<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.420> better<00:02:53.630> for

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
either I think that this is better for

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.210 
either I think that this is better for
dry<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:55.310> normal<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:57.350> maybe<00:02:57.560> even<00:02:57.920> slightly

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
dry to normal to maybe even slightly

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.000 
dry to normal to maybe even slightly
oily<00:02:58.700> skin<00:02:59.330> but<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.170> oily<00:03:00.500> skin<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.800> would

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
oily skin but for oily skin I would

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.580 
oily skin but for oily skin I would
highly<00:03:01.490> recommend<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.959> Make<00:03:03.140> Up<00:03:03.170> For<00:03:03.320> Ever

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
highly recommend the Make Up For Ever

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.730 
highly recommend the Make Up For Ever
matte<00:03:04.040> velvet<00:03:04.280> plus<00:03:04.880> which<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.320> takes<00:03:06.560> away

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
matte velvet plus which just takes away

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.760 
matte velvet plus which just takes away
a<00:03:06.860> little<00:03:07.100> bit<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:08.510> more<00:03:08.750> mattifying<00:03:09.290> than

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
a little bit it's more mattifying than

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.680 
a little bit it's more mattifying than
this<00:03:09.980> one<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.820> original<00:03:11.300> HD

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
this one and then the original HD

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.400 
this one and then the original HD
foundation<00:03:11.840> also<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:13.670> think<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.540> reason

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
foundation also I think that the reason

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.370 
foundation also I think that the reason
why<00:03:15.800> HD<00:03:16.430> foundations<00:03:17.030> became<00:03:17.450> such<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.050> hype

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
why HD foundations became such a hype

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.560 
why HD foundations became such a hype
was<00:03:19.070> because<00:03:19.550> celebrities<00:03:20.390> like<00:03:20.540> Kim

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570

the<00:04:07.160> old<00:04:07.370> Make<00:04:08.180> Up<00:04:08.269> For<00:04:08.330> Ever<00:04:08.510> HD<00:04:08.750> foundation

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
the old Make Up For Ever HD foundation

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.320 
the old Make Up For Ever HD foundation
kind<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:09.920> had<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> complicated<00:04:10.760> numbering

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
kind of had a complicated numbering

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.800 
kind of had a complicated numbering
system<00:04:11.810> where<00:04:12.799> they<00:04:12.950> had<00:04:13.250> pink<00:04:14.150> undertones

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
system where they had pink undertones

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.259 
system where they had pink undertones
yellow<00:04:15.290> undertones<00:04:15.890> beige<00:04:16.310> undertones<00:04:16.970> red

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
yellow undertones beige undertones red

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.270 
yellow undertones beige undertones red
undertones<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.590> numbering<00:04:19.070> system

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
undertones and the numbering system

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.070 
undertones and the numbering system
didn't<00:04:19.760> really<00:04:19.940> make<00:04:20.060> sense<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.720> all<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
didn't really make sense that all the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.200 
didn't really make sense that all the
numbers<00:04:21.350> were<00:04:21.470> kind<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:22.490> my<00:04:22.520> sister<00:04:23.000> for

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
numbers were kind of like my sister for

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.659 
numbers were kind of like my sister for
example<00:04:23.240> is<00:04:23.840> lighter<00:04:24.169> skinned<00:04:24.680> than<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.100> am<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
example is lighter skinned than I am and

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.180 
example is lighter skinned than I am and
her<00:04:26.150> number<00:04:26.510> was<00:04:26.720> higher<00:04:27.050> than<00:04:27.410> my<00:04:27.680> number<00:04:28.010> so

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
her number was higher than my number so

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.740 
her number was higher than my number so
that<00:04:28.340> was<00:04:28.610> really<00:04:28.820> confusing<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.570> lot<00:04:29.630> of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
that was really confusing for a lot of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.990 
that was really confusing for a lot of
people<00:04:30.169> what<00:04:30.770> makeup<00:04:31.070> forever<00:04:31.310> did<00:04:31.669> for<00:04:31.880> their

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
people what makeup forever did for their

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.090 
people what makeup forever did for their
new<00:04:32.180> Ultra<00:04:32.690> HD<00:04:32.720> foundation<00:04:33.200> is<00:04:33.710> they<00:04:33.890> only

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
new Ultra HD foundation is they only

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.580 
new Ultra HD foundation is they only
stuck<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:35.030> yellow<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.570> red<00:04:35.810> undertones<00:04:36.410> which

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
stuck to yellow and red undertones which

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.830 
stuck to yellow and red undertones which
is<00:04:36.740> much<00:04:37.100> more<00:04:37.400> clear<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.270> think<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.660> it's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
is much more clear and I think that it's

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.620 
is much more clear and I think that it's
more<00:04:39.650> typical<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.760> standard<00:04:41.419> in<00:04:41.539> the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
more typical and standard in the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.000 
more typical and standard in the
industry<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.380> yellow<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.890> red

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
industry to have yellow and red

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.060 
industry to have yellow and red
undertone<00:04:43.780> descriptions<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.380> what<00:04:45.650> they<00:04:45.830> did

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
undertone descriptions so what they did

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.770 
undertone descriptions so what they did
was<00:04:46.340> they<00:04:46.640> came<00:04:46.849> out<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> new<00:04:47.390> numbering

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
was they came out with a new numbering

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.920 
was they came out with a new numbering
system<00:04:48.200> so<00:04:48.440> they<00:04:49.010> have<00:04:49.340> red<00:04:50.300> yellow<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.690> red

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
system so they have red yellow and red

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.010 
system so they have red yellow and red
undertones<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.710> then<00:04:51.890> they<00:04:52.010> also<00:04:52.370> go<00:04:52.610> by<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
undertones and then they also go by the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.510 
undertones and then they also go by the
lowest<00:04:54.530> number<00:04:54.830> being<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.070> lightest<00:04:55.490> shade

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
lowest number being the lightest shade

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.700 
lowest number being the lightest shade
to<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.180> highest<00:04:56.479> number<00:04:56.930> being<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.229> darkest

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
to the highest number being the darkest

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.070 
to the highest number being the darkest
shade<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.400> what<00:04:59.150> they<00:04:59.300> also<00:04:59.450> did<00:04:59.750> which<00:04:59.930> was

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
shade so what they also did which was

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.190 
shade so what they also did which was
really<00:05:00.440> wise<00:05:00.830> was<00:05:01.520> their<00:05:01.760> packaging<00:05:02.479> on<00:05:02.900> their

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
really wise was their packaging on their

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.950 
really wise was their packaging on their
packaging<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.070> they<00:05:04.460> have<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:05.330> numbers

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
packaging and they have the numbers

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.930 
packaging and they have the numbers
listed<00:05:06.169> right<00:05:06.500> on<00:05:06.560> top<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:07.220> they<00:05:07.370> have<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.789> old

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
listed right on top so they have the old

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.589 
listed right on top so they have the old
numbering<00:05:08.450> system<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.520> then<00:05:10.520> they<00:05:10.640> have<00:05:10.910> the

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
numbering system and then they have the

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.600 
numbering system and then they have the
new<00:05:12.050> one<00:05:12.260> right<00:05:12.470> under<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.010> for<00:05:13.190> example

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
new one right under it so for example

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.450 
new one right under it so for example
this<00:05:13.729> is<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:13.940> old<00:05:14.180> one<00:05:14.440> 118<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.770> then<00:05:16.340> they

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
this is the old one 118 and then they

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.960 
this is the old one 118 and then they
have

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
have

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.200 
have
y3<00:05:17.930> 25<00:05:18.530> right<00:05:18.979> underneath<00:05:19.340> it<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.910> it's

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
y3 25 right underneath it and it's

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.730 
y3 25 right underneath it and it's
really<00:05:20.479> good<00:05:20.750> because<00:05:20.810> they<00:05:21.020> also<00:05:21.169> have<00:05:21.560> that

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
really good because they also have that

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.550 
really good because they also have that
right<00:05:21.800> underneath<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:23.000> bottle<00:05:23.360> too<00:05:23.660> so<00:05:24.260> in

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
right underneath the bottle too so in

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.710 
right underneath the bottle too so in
case<00:05:24.770> you<00:05:24.950> throw<00:05:25.160> out<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.520> black<00:05:25.760> cover<00:05:26.510> you

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
case you throw out the black cover you

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.790 
case you throw out the black cover you
don't<00:05:26.810> need<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.080> worry<00:05:27.289> about<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.680> because

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
don't need to worry about it because

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.589 
don't need to worry about it because
it's<00:05:28.220> right<00:05:28.370> underneath<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.849> bottle<00:05:29.240> so

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
it's right underneath the bottle so

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.000 
it's right underneath the bottle so
overall<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.110> would<00:05:30.440> definitely<00:05:30.860> recommend

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010
