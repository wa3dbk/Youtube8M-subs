00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.360
 Hello friends with you and you 921 I 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.610
 keep playing us three nasty 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.349
 account once such a thing I decided 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.019
 ride on those tanks that are long 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.949
 a long time ago to buy back which is new 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.199
 to your account 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.050
 I see no need but nevertheless 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.820
 they enter into some such 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.679
 hit parade of tanks which is very often 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.289
 asked to make a video of the same 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.660
 hit parade t28 prototype here alawar 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.149
 in 40 tons sometime we will reach them 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.340
 decided to start exactly 130 with the American 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.600
 self-propelled and ninth level can not 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.300
 no way get used all the same that we have 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.219
 Fri-Sau because most recently for 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.219
 I personally had this tank at all 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.109
 American top zhevyi level 10 and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.539
 tom with everything he was my very first 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.670
 deflated that is so much on with 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.420
 he was bound when that now 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.460
 inc. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.410
 at the ninth level as if forgotten 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.320
 most often when I was asked to do 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.780
 exactly the video on it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 question was something like this that such 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 seeing who did it all now 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.920
 changed other artillery others 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 other setup cards and many other things that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.770
 how note 30 is played right now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 as well as 2 years ago 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.660
 the only place u is strong is this 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.000
 our tank to 30 this mask mask if 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.770
 he would all consist of a mask sticking out of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 his trunk there would be none 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.710
 claims and so the mask takes only 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.200
 only he could tower it is not all and falls 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 often he and a lot if he gets enemies 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.300
 to any other places of our corps and in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.850
 including towers here for example now i 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.899
 I pay for my big mistake 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 instead of cheerfully and confidently 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.369
 dive into this puddle on the sandy river in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.229
 which I could confidently there through 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.630
 the tower is always dismantled slowly in battle 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.340
 as the wind you have and nothing would not hurt 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 there the whole team shoot off neat 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.920
 actually tanking the tower but not the same 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 I get under the distribution of Article 1 which is there for 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.360
 the diagonals of the drawing square in me 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 shoot didn't even show up from above 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 still luckily drove from where 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.030
 curious that he points out the review itself 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.070
 I did not see me 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 and I'm into it for Tyson's filigree not 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.840
 would highlight it if he saw me 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.690
 and lit it up from Article 1 would probably still 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.180
 it's true practice shows that I 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.920
 so constantly play at the beginning of stupidity 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.200
 losing somewhere half and if 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.750
 in general, not everything even has its own hp and then 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.190
 on these balances on pairs literally 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.049
 tried to pull something there 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 any homework stuff well i mean 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.860
 becoming very careful so 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.860
 provident usually this and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.110
 you need our y principle for efficient 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.730
 wallpaper well yes god with it if it is not to take 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.650
 into account that deny it 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 really very good unit and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 maybe he is somewhat morally under 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.880
 outdated amid the appearance of all sorts there 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.670
 waffentragers when bts towers are already 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.650
 nonsense is already the norm and therefore it is on 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.989
 waffle looks a little bit somehow 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.570
 because what's up with that armor 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.630
 frankly not very much that this and that 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.900
 of the tower rotates hardly well waffles 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.180
 there is more or less some kind of disguise 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.410
 there is such a small size of your 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.100
 own case 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.200
 there is choosing weapons in principle among 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.610
 Here is such a big woman already Halka but either 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.740
 more accurate me gun 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.110
 Yes, and then actually waffentraguera 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.610
 generally accepted imba not only because 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.380
 she is generally recognized by all those who 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.930
 plays the game duck also by all those who 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.520
 it creates and modifies it because they 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.070
 On purpose and update the Islands and specifically 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.290
 ponerfili way a couple of battles on 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.110
 defeated offline noted that he got up 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.870
 something worse pollack is still mega 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.390
 imba from denying looks like this 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.540
 how to be typical is called the average 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580
 that is, he or his nerve is clearly not threatened 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.560
 although once his nerves were his nerve or 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.930
 friends would you remember how much is there 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.910
 was in kent deny having a tower 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 counted directly criminal 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.460
 a punishable act as if kings 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.320
 for it is godless now in the era of all sorts 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.930
 waffles have become much easier with this 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.430
 but at least for the waffles themselves 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.220
 from and 30 sometime very seriously 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 Ogreb in the end it turns out that with low dp 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.750
 moms don't just fight here 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 such here pvp any places especially with 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.620
 classmates especially tanks 10 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.510
 level and accounts most often 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.359
 use such a typical bush 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.020
 from stone shelters 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.240
 careful thoughtfully leisurely probably 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.640
 so I consider up to 30 one of the most 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.370
 probably easy to learn car among 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.140
 the crap in the game having bashki is incredible 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.419
 relaxing gives complete freedom of movement 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.110
 and then what to hide this whole thread 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.730
 starting 149 hellcat 25 in half well really 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.440
 20 in half probably has some 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.190
 Difficulties with his not so great 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.440
 armor penetration 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.480
 but all other cars are almost better 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.320
 their levels well, maybe there is a prototype 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.570
 not easy too 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.430
 because of its slowness but the tower 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.890
 also there is about not to pierce and also 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.840
 good dpm good i'm probably 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.669
 just how you rocked of course 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.250
 Soviet pt should probably take up 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.050
 American and these are all German waffles 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.550
 leave already at the time when you are completely 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.830
 you will feel confidently grated 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.500
 Already such a roll will be when for you 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.680
 on lack of armor it is not a sentence 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.330
 just a reason to go on the other side 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.590
 now finally let's get back to 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.560
 battle which principle already 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.630
 well I understand what will end in 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.580
 need to dry while wins in principle 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.950
 perfect as you would have to play it 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.400
 immediately feel free to dive here 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.560
 pit 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.450
 here in the absence of artillery in 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.889
 the enemy team everything would have broken 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.020
 just with a bang and in such here 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.910
 moments for 30 feels perfect 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.530
 especially know here on the background of all these 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.090
 recent events of our game when 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.360
 quite a few cards are added which 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.190
 abound, and noses there corridors 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.010
 swings where any bump for any 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.560
 oak tone as a real challenge for t30 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.740
 this is the perfect place exactly where it can 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.570
 most of all stuff nastrelyat if 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.280
 more than you will not interfere with the enemy 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.979
 aim a fairly large commander 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.870
 the tower she appears in a sight 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.610
 the enemy probably much earlier than ours 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.240
 sturdy mask in which does not make sense 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.790
 shoot 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.400
 so I can receive more often but in 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.350
 In the end, up to 30, so much has passed 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.690
 a lot of time has changed but he 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.220
 now very very fit into our 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.470
 group with all current obligations 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.070
 yes and also it seems to me not 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.750
 much worse than all the other newbies 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.400
 Incidentally, it is now pretty 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.220
 rare occurring anywhere 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.500
 a platoon of two or even 3 t30 at once 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.020
 After all, as I remember in those days when 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.610
 we played on t30 at all in hard drinking when 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.280
 the branch just got out 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.950
 American pt 10 level where there was 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.590
 test 10 4 at the end of the trip we are with a huge 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.140
 pleasure rolled in 30 in platoon 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.180
 because d food is a couple of such 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.940
 alpha babahalo k not able to delay 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.370
 any horde of the enemy unless of course 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.280
 somehow stupidly be substituted but 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.340
 the result is that t30 two years later 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.680
 feels great in my hands 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.970
 every fight that took place there 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.820
 was productive 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.940
 and even more than suited me therefore 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.820
 t30 is still beautiful there if not 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.830
 Believe check download and I have you 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.930
 I assure you will get a lot of pleasure 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.970
 Thanks for watching the results. 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.289

 subscribe to my channel to new 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.190
 See you all for now
