 dreams

 there are no two ways to evolve in this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.850
 world 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 one is through love and another 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 through pain with the way you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.489
 choose today do not prevent do not let the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.309
 shyness that prevents you from seeking your 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.409
 dreams if you like dancing if you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.320
 likes to sing 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.049
 if there is something if there is some talent that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 Do you believe in your heart there? 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.180
 be afraid do not be ashamed believe 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 in you is on your side because it 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.200
 You're not on your side, nobody. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 but will do it for you? 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 in this walk here in this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 Earth 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.729
 we need to walk with our own 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.689
 legs and do not use other people 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.350
 crutch 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.070
 then the great exercise of acting in the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.409
 stage of life is learning to be an actress. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.509
 principal actor 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.450
 as our august master cury says 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.399
 is the lead actress in the theater of his 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 Life does not mean to be more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.430
 important that nobody 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 This does not mean being above 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.869
 no one wants to say take own 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.079
 able to take their own choices and I 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 I like this I want it that makes me 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.119
 well then it's after that that I go and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 have that power to choose instead 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.459
 sitting on a background as an audience 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.979
 watching life go by 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.159
 so today's suggestion is like this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.860
 do what you love, love what you do 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.840
 And do not let the team leave you in the way. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.019
 because their team is a subtle form of 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.599
 fear fear than fear of not being accepted 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.690
 fear of not being approved 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.879
 fear of not being recognized as loved 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 valued by other people 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.620
 remembering that people are different 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 ideas are different wills are 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.440
 different ones like blue others from 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.810
 yellow and we did not like emusa all 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.760
 So when you step in, it's in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.920
 any situation in your life think 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 so I'm going to please my soul I 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.450

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
