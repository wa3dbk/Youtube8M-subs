drsa<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.640> NASA<00:01:32.880> lap<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.240> Monaco

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
drsa as you can the NASA lap and Monaco

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.289 
drsa as you can the NASA lap and Monaco
so<00:01:33.990> we've<00:01:34.650> managed<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.820> manage<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so we've managed to do you manage to do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
so we've managed to do you manage to do
a<00:01:36.509> thirteen<00:01:37.020> point<00:01:37.259> six<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.009> pretty

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
a thirteen point six which is a pretty

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
a thirteen point six which is a pretty
good<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.450> messed<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> couple<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
good time I messed up on a couple of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
good time I messed up on a couple of
corners<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.400> could<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.840> improved

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
corners there where could have improved

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.950 
corners there where could have improved
slightly<00:01:43.049> my<00:01:43.350> PB<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.040> 13<00:01:44.670> 4<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
slightly my PB is a 13 4 but as you can

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.569 
slightly my PB is a 13 4 but as you can
see<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.790> 1904<00:01:47.790> 6<00:01:48.060> 8<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> 17<00:01:48.840> 7<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.799> first

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
see here 1904 6 8 and 17 7 so the first

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
see here 1904 6 8 and 17 7 so the first
and<00:01:50.880> last<00:01:51.030> set<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.079> middle

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and last set do really good but middle

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.560 
and last set do really good but middle
sector<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.759> couple<00:01:54.090> attempts<00:01:54.420> off

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
sector was a about a couple attempts off

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.139 
sector was a about a couple attempts off
so<00:01:54.920> overall<00:01:55.920> pretty<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.219> lap<00:01:56.520> hopefully<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
so overall pretty good lap hopefully and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.490 
so overall pretty good lap hopefully and

it's not 11:11 let you go be using

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
eleven eight because I find around here

eleven eight because I find around here
haven't<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> need<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.840> turning

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
haven't you need a more for turning

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.619 
haven't you need a more for turning
rather<00:02:07.500> than<00:02:07.970> having<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.420> stability

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
rather than having just that stability

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.839 
rather than having just that stability
you<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.289> need<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:10.709> turning<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.670> find

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
you just need more turning I just find

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.360 
you just need more turning I just find
having<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> sharper<00:02:12.569> front<00:02:12.780> end<00:02:12.930> just

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
having a sharper front end just

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.860 
having a sharper front end just
really<00:02:13.910> helps<00:02:14.120> around<00:02:14.360> here<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.840> can

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
really helps around here and as you can

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.120 
really helps around here and as you can
see<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.110> brakes<00:02:15.380> are<00:02:15.590> pretty<00:02:15.620> different<00:02:15.920> as

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
see the brakes are pretty different as

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.200 
see the brakes are pretty different as
well<00:02:16.310> I've<00:02:16.400> got<00:02:16.520> 46

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
well I've got 46

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.230 
well I've got 46
I<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.990> 54<00:02:18.590> high<00:02:18.830> standard<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:19.820> stopping

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
I have 54 high standard I think stopping

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.940 
I have 54 high standard I think stopping
power<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.540> pretty<00:02:20.810> crucial<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.500> since<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
power is pretty crucial and since the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.830 
power is pretty crucial and since the
game<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.340> almost<00:02:22.580> impossible<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.180> lock<00:02:23.420> up<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
game it's almost impossible to lock up I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.020 
game it's almost impossible to lock up I
think<00:02:24.440> that's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:25.010> really<00:02:25.580> good<00:02:25.700> combination

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
think that's a really good combination

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.660 
think that's a really good combination
and<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.870> find<00:02:27.320> putting<00:02:27.830> more<00:02:28.040> towards<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.460> rear

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and I find putting more towards the rear

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.120 
and I find putting more towards the rear
just<00:02:28.990> Jarrett's<00:02:29.990> move<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.440> over<00:02:30.830> see<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
just Jarrett's move it's over see and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.260 
just Jarrett's move it's over see and
that's<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.610> pretty<00:02:31.760> actually<00:02:31.970> pretty

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
that's that's pretty actually pretty

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.240 
that's that's pretty actually pretty
good<00:02:32.420> thing<00:02:32.660> around<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:33.050> as<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.130> see

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
good thing around here as you can see

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.000 
good thing around here as you can see
the<00:02:34.370> balance<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.880> 911<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.720> always<00:02:36.500> go<00:02:36.650> go<00:02:36.830> over

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the balance is 911 I always go go over

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.640 
the balance is 911 I always go go over
1111<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:37.850> 911<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.140> still<00:02:39.410> need

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
1111 but 911 you just you still need

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.260 
1111 but 911 you just you still need
that<00:02:39.680> high<00:02:40.550> speed<00:02:40.850> cornering<00:02:41.210> grip

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
that high speed cornering grip

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.850 
that high speed cornering grip
particularly<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.080> top<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.440> hill<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
particularly for the top of the hill and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.530 
particularly for the top of the hill and
for<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.430> fast<00:02:43.700> left<00:02:43.970> hand<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.300> right

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
for that fast left hand that right

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.000 
for that fast left hand that right
handers<00:02:44.960> as<00:02:45.110> well<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.470> quite<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> few<00:02:45.830> high

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
handers as well it's quite a few high

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.070 
handers as well it's quite a few high
speed<00:02:46.310> coins<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.700> need<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.910> grip<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.959> it's

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
speed coins you need to grip for so it's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.300 
speed coins you need to grip for so it's
a<00:02:48.110> good<00:02:48.260> compromise<00:02:48.590> me<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.190> 11<00:02:49.580> 111<00:02:50.320> 111<00:02:51.320> 1<00:02:52.070> on

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
a good compromise me and 11 111 111 1 on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
a good compromise me and 11 111 111 1 on
the<00:02:52.780> ride<00:02:53.780> height<00:02:53.959> obviously<00:02:54.320> for

the ride height obviously for
straight-line<00:02:54.860> speed<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.940> 11<00:02:56.300> 1<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:57.050> the

straight-line speed and the 11 1 for the

straight-line speed and the 11 1 for the
spring<00:02:57.650> stiffness<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.490> just<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.120> get

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
spring stiffness it's just to get

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.660 
spring stiffness it's just to get
maximum<00:02:59.930> traction<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.590> could<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.070> 11<00:03:01.400> 11

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
maximum traction you could have it 11 11

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.220 
maximum traction you could have it 11 11
which<00:03:02.180> would<00:03:02.300> give<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.510> more<00:03:02.660> responsiveness

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
which would give you more responsiveness

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.110 
which would give you more responsiveness
but<00:03:03.530> you're<00:03:03.680> actually<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.640> really

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
but you're actually really really

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.940 
but you're actually really really
damaging<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:05.750> traction<00:03:06.200> traction<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.740> pretty

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
damaging on traction traction is pretty

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.010 
damaging on traction traction is pretty
crucial<00:03:07.220> ramp<00:03:07.550> here<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:08.540> for<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.780> lime

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
crucial ramp here and as for your lime

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.390 
crucial ramp here and as for your lime
and<00:03:09.200> top<00:03:09.380> due<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.800> bottom<00:03:10.010> two<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and top due to that bottom two to the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.830 
and top due to that bottom two to the
right<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.880> get<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> best<00:03:11.300> time<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.720> both

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
right just to get the best time for both

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.440 
right just to get the best time for both
so<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.220> lap<00:03:13.340> on<00:03:13.459> Monaco<00:03:13.850> here<00:03:14.060> hopefully

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
so that's a lap on Monaco here hopefully

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.810 
so that's a lap on Monaco here hopefully

my lines are braking points of help Joe
I<00:03:16.940> know<00:03:17.000> it's<00:03:17.269> quite<00:03:17.390> difficult<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.930> see

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
I know it's quite difficult to see

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.770 
I know it's quite difficult to see
because<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:18.709> such<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> fast<00:03:19.459> pace<00:03:19.550> but

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
because it's such a fast pace but

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.759 
because it's such a fast pace but
hopefully<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.930> go<00:03:21.080> through<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.590> can

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
hopefully if you go through that you can

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.350 
hopefully if you go through that you can
see<00:03:22.070> exactly<00:03:22.370> where<00:03:22.640> I'm<00:03:22.760> braking<00:03:23.150> why<00:03:23.300> I'm

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360
