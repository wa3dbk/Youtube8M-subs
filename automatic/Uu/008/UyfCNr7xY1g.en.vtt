00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
versus putting the chickens under the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 
versus putting the chickens under the
heat<00:02:23.890> lamps<00:02:24.250> although<00:02:25.239> most<00:02:25.660> people<00:02:25.780> that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
heat lamps although most people that

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.960 
heat lamps although most people that
come<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:26.380> here<00:02:26.650> they<00:02:26.890> want<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.190> hand<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.730> when

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
come out here they want a hand and when

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.570 
come out here they want a hand and when
you<00:02:28.060> raise<00:02:28.239> them<00:02:28.450> naturally<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.770> lot

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you raise them naturally you get a lot

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.420 
you raise them naturally you get a lot
more<00:02:30.610> roosters<00:02:31.180> than<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.720> hen<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.280> we

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
more roosters than you do hen so so we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.740 
more roosters than you do hen so so we
still<00:02:33.670> buy<00:02:33.819> them<00:02:33.940> from<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.120> hatchery<00:02:34.390> we

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
still buy them from the hatchery we

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.600 
still buy them from the hatchery we
raise<00:02:34.930> them<00:02:35.080> under<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.440> heat<00:02:35.650> lamps<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.280> then

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
raise them under the heat lamps and then

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.449 
raise them under the heat lamps and then
once<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.300> get<00:02:37.750> their<00:02:37.930> feathers<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:39.100> bring

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
once they get their feathers we bring

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.940 
once they get their feathers we bring
them<00:02:39.550> out<00:02:39.700> into<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.300> into<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.840> pen<00:02:41.080> after

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
them out into the into the pen after

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.729 
them out into the into the pen after
they<00:02:42.069> get<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.910> their<00:02:43.060> laying<00:02:43.420> age<00:02:43.780> then<00:02:44.350> we

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
they get to their laying age then we

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.740 
they get to their laying age then we
take<00:02:44.950> them<00:02:45.160> out<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> Pens<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.150> move<00:02:46.540> them

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
take them out of the Pens and move them

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.920 
take them out of the Pens and move them
out<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.319> pasture<00:02:47.560> as<00:02:47.860> much<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.160> possible

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
out to the pasture as much as possible

to graze on the west side of the farm
with<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> intention<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.819> plant<00:02:55.120> more<00:02:55.390> grass

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660

on the south end inside the house Shelly

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.060 
on the south end inside the house Shelly
displays<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.489> variety<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.299> fresh<00:03:01.630> eggs<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
displays a variety of fresh eggs the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.560 
displays a variety of fresh eggs the
smaller<00:03:03.370> ones<00:03:03.579> like<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:04.000> these<00:03:04.269> are<00:03:04.329> the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
smaller ones like this these are the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.259 
smaller ones like this these are the
poet's<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.350> started<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:07.120> maybe

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
poet's that just started so for maybe

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.449 
poet's that just started so for maybe
about<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.570> month<00:03:07.870> they'll<00:03:08.739> lay<00:03:08.980> them<00:03:09.100> like<00:03:09.130> this

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
about a month they'll lay them like this

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.130 
about a month they'll lay them like this
and<00:03:09.730> then<00:03:09.820> they'll<00:03:10.030> gradually<00:03:10.750> get<00:03:10.959> bigger

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
and then they'll gradually get bigger

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.860 
and then they'll gradually get bigger
and<00:03:11.440> bigger<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.299> weigh<00:03:13.510> them<00:03:13.720> all

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
and bigger and so we just weigh them all

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.729 
and bigger and so we just weigh them all
out<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.470> put<00:03:15.480> them<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:17.230> them<00:03:17.320> in<00:03:17.410> cartons

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
out and put them in put them in cartons

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.550 
out and put them in put them in cartons
we<00:03:18.609> usually<00:03:18.880> sell<00:03:19.120> them<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.870> carton<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.320> like

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
we usually sell them the carton is like

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.009 
we usually sell them the carton is like
the<00:03:20.850> medium<00:03:21.850> through<00:03:22.030> extra-large<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.810> sort

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
the medium through extra-large is sort

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.560 
the medium through extra-large is sort
of<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.109> variety<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.739> them<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.070> then<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:25.209> small

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
of a variety of them and then the small

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.420 
of a variety of them and then the small
ones<00:03:25.780> are<00:03:25.870> really<00:03:26.019> small<00:03:26.290> ones<00:03:26.500> that's<00:03:27.220> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
ones are really small ones that's the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.140 
ones are really small ones that's the
ones<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:27.730> eat<00:03:29.100> we<00:03:30.100> first<00:03:30.370> got<00:03:30.549> chickens<00:03:30.940> for

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
ones we eat we first got chickens for

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.020 
ones we eat we first got chickens for
our<00:03:31.239> own<00:03:31.390> eggs<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:32.829> enjoy<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.880> got

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
our own eggs and we enjoy them so we got

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.800 
our own eggs and we enjoy them so we got
more<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:35.010> then<00:03:36.010> when<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.060> got<00:03:37.209> more<00:03:37.510> I

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
more and then when we got more I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.690 
more and then when we got more I
realized<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.590> probably<00:03:38.650> had<00:03:39.190> more<00:03:39.400> than<00:03:39.549> we

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
realized I probably had more than we

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.270 
realized I probably had more than we
needed<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:40.180> had<00:03:40.359> too<00:03:40.570> many<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.140> decided<00:03:42.130> to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
needed we had too many so I decided to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.849 
needed we had too many so I decided to
sell<00:03:42.459> some<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.880> they<00:03:43.420> sold<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.019> fast<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.829> I

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
sell some and they sold so fast that I

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.310 
sell some and they sold so fast that I
thought<00:03:45.250> there's<00:03:46.150> probably<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.600> demand<00:03:47.049> for

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
thought there's probably a demand for

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.840 
thought there's probably a demand for
this<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.430> then<00:03:49.209> we<00:03:50.049> had<00:03:50.140> purchased<00:03:50.350> some

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
this so then we had purchased some

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.360 
this so then we had purchased some
rescue<00:03:51.850> horses<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.600> were<00:03:53.260> quite<00:03:53.500> costly<00:03:54.100> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
rescue horses that were quite costly and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.090 
rescue horses that were quite costly and
and<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.900> love<00:03:56.290> my<00:03:56.440> horses<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.069> I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and I have this I love my horses so I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.069 
and I have this I love my horses so I
thought<00:03:57.459> well<00:03:57.640> maybe<00:03:57.840> raising<00:03:58.840> chickens

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
thought well maybe raising chickens

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.250 
thought well maybe raising chickens
would<00:03:59.319> be<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.470> way<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.239> offset<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.750> cost<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.170> the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
would be a way to offset the cost of the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.559 
would be a way to offset the cost of the
horses<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.650> little<00:04:02.950> bit<00:04:03.100> now<00:04:03.970> when<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.239> put<00:04:04.450> it

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
horses a little bit now when you put it

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.740 
horses a little bit now when you put it
pencil<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.140> paper<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.890> probably<00:04:06.489> doesn't

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
pencil to paper it probably doesn't

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.960 
pencil to paper it probably doesn't
pencil<00:04:07.750> out<00:04:07.930> very<00:04:08.199> well<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.489> chickens

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
pencil out very well but the chickens

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.820 
pencil out very well but the chickens
are<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:10.840> entertaining

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
are so entertaining

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.860 
are so entertaining
I<00:04:11.920> have<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:12.550> many<00:04:12.640> people<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.120> will<00:04:13.330> tell<00:04:13.810> me

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
I have so many people that will tell me

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.930
