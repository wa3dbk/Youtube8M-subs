00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.940
 summertime vacation time highest time with 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.799
 Chris never talks about hairstyles 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.810
 then get a beautiful beach 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.059
 for example, a simpler yet 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.830
 damn well the hairstyle looks him yes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.360
 and today I start with it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 I am relative to that in the morning 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.660
 quickly finished well so that one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 Effective did so but my hairstyle you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 daylong stops because if I 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 I'm down shopping and that's why 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 I call myself a classic today 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 pike braid decided where he many 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 many women find the great but 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.670
 Mostly do not know again 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.940
 and actually that he is easier than 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 you think and if you have the hair 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.080
 also we lend that sound quite quite 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.970
 fast and simple without it 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.700
 finger that one reports the fingers 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 so and first backwards but 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 still relatively loose so not 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:01:02.930
 back to the stern and then we divide 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:05.570
 the braid in half and then with it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.230
 have shared over there we always take 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.390
 from one side down a little 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.200
 passe about the strength I would 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.840
 take now and a piece of hair strand 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.820
 from below and place them over the others 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 So rausgenommen over the coach boris 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.600
 have to go to the other side 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 that's the first step then 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.800
 we have the hair piece here what 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.150
 now, so to speak, from which the strand 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:36.050
 was taken and have that to the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.509
 So the other side is taken over 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.670
 one same on the other side 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.970
 we take back from the h what are we from 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.590
 this time left piece has a passive 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.619
 from below so a hair piece from below 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.750
 and put it on the same place 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.430
 the right side that you have so 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.770
 once from left to right and 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 once made from right to left and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.330
 We repeat that all the time 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.130
 means we go again so short one 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.560
 arrange schwuppdiwupp now we go 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 again from the right side into the hair 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.990
 part from below and put it over that 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.790
 would say after a bit of exercise though 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.450
 It's basically really simple 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.450
 So you have to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.760
 that's probably right and left that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.760
 the difficulty is that women 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.440
 others to one side of another 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.930
 turn each side quickly anyway 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.760
 and we just think about it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.590
 want to keep it loose it should not 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.910
 Being strict we are on vacation we are 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.460
 not on the catwalk we do not do it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 cover shooting but we are in 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.400
 Holiday is also said as he said that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.290
 but this hairstyle is quick if you go 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.250
 which has made two three times then 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080
 you're really within five 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.700
 minutes 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.930
 and not that they are 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.300
 it must be neat that it is not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.070
 must be placed in the sense comes 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.590
 You also progress pretty quickly once you get there 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.760
 once the rhythm has it in and what 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.400
 it is also time course times can 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 vary that you can vary 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.490
 make a page-top for example 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.760
 nothing sides if you short here 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.870
 passagen has to which person couple 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.820
 do not necessarily like that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.860
 you can grow them out too 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.390
 always a bit twirling you have 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.980
 real possibility with this hairstyle you 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.050
 can be personalized job in itself it can 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.060
 the sides are so you have to do it 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 not now since I have it now 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.320
 but you came at the back of the back 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.570
 can also use it on the side and lay 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.860
 have really variations that 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.550
 what I like about the job will be so nice 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.350
 markus vannes pattern 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.370
 It is definitely unusual 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970
 that is not a classic one 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.190
 plaited plait and you have on each 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.040
 case nice variations and 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.300
 The victory I find easy personally 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.490
 I am a bit absorbed in the course of the 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.110
 I do not care about the day I am 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.000
 a fan of it fringe individual 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.240
 pull out so it is so loud it is 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.680
 it is a vacation trip in any case 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.690
 very casual very very simple and very 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.130
 effective but still so bumblebee 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.420
 now it was quite a bit pure 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:14.920
 especially I know you can do that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.239
 may everything go on we take 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.320
 we are already at the end and we are 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.810
 right now that's maybe three 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.360
 minutes to weave so it works 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.950
 pretty fast and it's already included 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.200
 your hair structure because you have so 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.700
 easily is easy to stand nature now 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 inside from the sun maybe 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.810
 African is my nature stand 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.760
 that means a different one 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.080
 have in the in the individual passes and 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.390
 Of course, this is also a nice 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.110
 effect 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.900
 so beautiful also found in this 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.580
 This hairstyle is beautiful 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.860
 distributed and hidden extensions in it 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.230
 So you're hiding for one too 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.690
 woman currently maybe extensions 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.600
 Coach has a good chance then 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.970
 to make effective hairstyle without you 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:14.290
 just the whole wrong hair out 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:18.820
 Everything looks natural, everything shines 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:30.400
 but not everything of course very much of me 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:34.270
 of course , that rested well 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.380
 namely always like and that are 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.690
 it is such a small transparent 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.070
 hair gums which also likes straight 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.140
 if you are so gerd loks 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.479
 makes and so there are there too 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.820
 really good if you have a small pot 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.650
 aminat and this last piece is just 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.100
 also not as voluminous as 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:54.310
 a neck so then turn your hair 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.730
 we make the rubber firm enough 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.710
 really three times through and if you are 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.930
 now as you can see then has 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.610
 you have a relatively neat one here 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.650
 Just say it and you can do it 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.380
 but pull out a bit more like that 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:13.110
 a little bit looser and has real 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.610
 a nice nice header in the back 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.710
 and the thing just does not really matter 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.910
 whether the whole day can be the whole day 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.170
 here to run and the hairstyle remains 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.750
 will only be here for a while now 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.340
 Use hairspray around that a bit 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.110
 to fix everything here in front of everything 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.870
 and that's it 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.850
 and it's summery, it's fresh 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.850
 It's young and it's cheeky and doable 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.850
 with pleasure
