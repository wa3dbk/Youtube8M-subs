00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.990 

so<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.380> don't<00:00:45.740> think<00:00:46.070> there's<00:00:46.400> a<00:00:46.460> reason<00:00:46.970> to

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
so you don't think there's a reason to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.690 
so you don't think there's a reason to
buy<00:00:47.330> that<00:00:47.630> special<00:00:48.010> transmission<00:00:49.010> fluid<00:00:49.400> for

you<00:00:53.960> see<00:00:54.170> automatic<00:00:54.890> transmission<00:00:55.610> fluids

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
you see automatic transmission fluids

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.630 
you see automatic transmission fluids
are<00:00:56.210> tailored<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.920> operating

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
are tailored to the operating

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.310 
are tailored to the operating
characteristics<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.750> specific

characteristics of a specific
transmission<00:01:01.130> now<00:01:01.970> what<00:01:02.600> we're<00:01:02.780> really

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
transmission now what we're really

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.650 
transmission now what we're really
talking<00:01:03.380> about<00:01:03.710> here<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> factor<00:01:05.030> known<00:01:05.330> as

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
talking about here is a factor known as

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
talking about here is a factor known as
coefficient<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:07.280> friction<00:01:08.000> now<00:01:08.870> if<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.260> think

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
coefficient of friction now if you think

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.340 
coefficient of friction now if you think
of<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:10.400> being<00:01:10.760> like<00:01:11.120> sandpaper<00:01:11.840> here<00:01:12.170> we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
of that as being like sandpaper here we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.850 
of that as being like sandpaper here we
have<00:01:12.590> coarse<00:01:13.250> sandpaper<00:01:14.110> medium<00:01:15.110> sandpaper

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
have coarse sandpaper medium sandpaper

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.250 
have coarse sandpaper medium sandpaper
and<00:01:16.190> fine<00:01:16.670> sandpaper<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.690> if<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.869> run<00:01:18.080> your

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
and fine sandpaper and if you run your

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.950 
and fine sandpaper and if you run your
hands<00:01:18.650> over<00:01:18.950> them<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.729> feel<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.330> real

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
hands over them you can feel a real

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.380 
hands over them you can feel a real
difference<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.890> certainly<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.759> course<00:01:23.090> is

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
difference and certainly the course is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.859 
difference and certainly the course is
more<00:01:23.660> grippy<00:01:24.290> than<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.009> fine<00:01:25.310> well<00:01:26.270> inside

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
more grippy than the fine well inside

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.770 
more grippy than the fine well inside
your<00:01:27.290> automatic<00:01:27.890> transmission<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:29.479> have

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
your automatic transmission you have

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.530 
your automatic transmission you have
clutches<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:31.250> unit<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:31.759> can<00:01:31.940> see<00:01:32.210> them<00:01:32.330> in

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
clutches in this unit we can see them in

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
clutches in this unit we can see them in
this<00:01:33.170> area<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.070> up<00:01:34.670> here

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
this area and up here

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.320 
this area and up here
well<00:01:35.990> these<00:01:36.229> clutches<00:01:36.680> are<00:01:37.310> similar<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.150> what

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
well these clutches are similar to what

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.270 
well these clutches are similar to what
we<00:01:38.509> have<00:01:38.780> right<00:01:39.140> here<00:01:39.200> these<00:01:39.650> are<00:01:39.710> actual

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
we have right here these are actual

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.870 
we have right here these are actual
automatic<00:01:41.090> transmission<00:01:41.900> clutch<00:01:42.250> disks<00:01:43.250> and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
automatic transmission clutch disks and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.400 
automatic transmission clutch disks and
if<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.200> get<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.009> wrong<00:01:46.990> transmission<00:01:47.990> fluid

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
if you get the wrong transmission fluid

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.830 
if you get the wrong transmission fluid
in<00:01:48.590> your<00:01:49.039> automatic<00:01:49.460> transmission<00:01:49.700> what<00:01:50.630> can

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
in your automatic transmission what can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.550 
in your automatic transmission what can
happen<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:52.250> simple<00:01:52.670> suppose<00:01:53.660> your

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
happen is really simple suppose your

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.010 
happen is really simple suppose your
transmission<00:01:55.490> takes<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.600> grippy

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
transmission takes this really grippy

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.010 
transmission takes this really grippy
high<00:01:57.679> coefficient<00:01:58.069> of<00:01:58.700> friction

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
high coefficient of friction

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.510 
high coefficient of friction
transmission<00:02:00.020> fluid<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.619> get<00:02:01.310> some

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
transmission fluid and you get some

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.300 
transmission fluid and you get some
generic<00:02:02.119> stuff<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.110> really<00:02:03.350> fine<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
generic stuff that is really fine with a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.450 
generic stuff that is really fine with a
low<00:02:04.670> coefficient<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.600> friction<00:02:06.100> every<00:02:07.100> time

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
low coefficient of friction every time

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.260 
low coefficient of friction every time
these<00:02:07.880> clutch<00:02:08.330> discs<00:02:08.929> are<00:02:09.369> engaged<00:02:10.369> you're

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
these clutch discs are engaged you're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.530 
these clutch discs are engaged you're
going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.810> get<00:02:11.990> slippage<00:02:13.150> slippage<00:02:14.150> means

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
going to get slippage slippage means

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.980 
going to get slippage slippage means
heat<00:02:14.930> heat<00:02:15.620> means<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.160> shorter<00:02:16.610> life<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.450> over<00:02:17.959> a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
heat heat means a shorter life so over a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.380 
heat heat means a shorter life so over a
period<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.560> time<00:02:18.800> you're<00:02:19.550> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.880> shorten

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
period of time you're going to shorten

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.570 
period of time you're going to shorten
the<00:02:20.510> life<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.900> your<00:02:21.050> transmission<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.459> you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the life of your transmission but you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.510 
the life of your transmission but you
say<00:02:22.790> well<00:02:23.060> no<00:02:23.569> that's<00:02:23.959> not<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.440> case<00:02:24.650> maybe

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
say well no that's not the case maybe

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.030 
say well no that's not the case maybe
I'm<00:02:25.700> going<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.120> some<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.630> that's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
I'm going to get some of this that's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
I'm going to get some of this that's
really<00:02:28.040> grippy<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.700> mine<00:02:28.910> doesn't<00:02:29.360> require

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
really grippy and mine doesn't require

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
really grippy and mine doesn't require
it<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.890> can't<00:02:31.190> be<00:02:31.280> bad<00:02:31.550> can<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> well<00:02:32.240> yes

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
it but that can't be bad can it well yes

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.680 
it but that can't be bad can it well yes
it<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.250> causes<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.030> clutches<00:02:35.660> to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it can because it causes the clutches to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.610 
it can because it causes the clutches to
engage<00:02:36.380> with<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.610> shock<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> firm<00:02:39.110> shift

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
engage with a shock you get a firm shift

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.360 
engage with a shock you get a firm shift
and<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:41.090> time<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.780> shock<00:02:42.290> load<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:43.040> the
