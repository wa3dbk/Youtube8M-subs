finish<00:02:18.959> your<00:02:19.140> studying<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.860> day<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.970> if

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
finish your studying for the day so if

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.540 
finish your studying for the day so if
you're<00:02:21.450> preparing<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:21.989> five<00:02:22.260> days<00:02:22.739> you're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
you're preparing for five days you're

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.240 
you're preparing for five days you're
writing<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.120> 20<00:02:24.930> times<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.319> day<00:02:25.349> you've

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
writing it out 20 times a day you've

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460 
writing it out 20 times a day you've
written<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.849> thing<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> hundred<00:02:28.140> times

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
written this thing out a hundred times

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.220 
written this thing out a hundred times
so<00:02:29.430> when<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> comes<00:02:30.000> time<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> take<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.870> test

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so when it comes time to take the test

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
so when it comes time to take the test
or<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.739> final<00:02:32.160> they'll<00:02:32.790> usually<00:02:33.239> give<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
or the final they'll usually give you a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.120 
or the final they'll usually give you a
scratch<00:02:35.610> sheet<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.030> paper<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.800> you've<00:02:37.800> run<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
scratch sheet of paper and you've run it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.550 
scratch sheet of paper and you've run it
out<00:02:38.250> 100<00:02:38.670> times<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:40.019> go<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.349> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
out 100 times you can just go on there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280 
out 100 times you can just go on there
and<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.769> make<00:02:41.190> your<00:02:41.250> chart<00:02:41.819> here<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.450> make

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and just make your chart here and make

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.650 
and just make your chart here and make
your<00:02:43.620> fluid<00:02:44.040> electrolyte<00:02:44.280> test<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:45.090> hundred

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
your fluid electrolyte test a hundred

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.990 
your fluid electrolyte test a hundred
percent<00:02:45.780> more<00:02:46.200> easier<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
percent more easier and this is what I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.559 
percent more easier and this is what I
did<00:02:48.330> with<00:02:48.540> my<00:02:48.810> nursing<00:02:49.709> studies<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.569> it

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
did with my nursing studies and it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.009 
did with my nursing studies and it
worked<00:02:52.019> wonders<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.890> me<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.329> chart<00:02:54.780> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
worked wonders for me so this chart you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.370 
worked wonders for me so this chart you
see<00:02:55.349> right<00:02:55.739> here<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:56.489> what<00:02:57.239> I'd<00:02:57.329> recommend<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
see right here is what I'd recommend the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.500 
see right here is what I'd recommend the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
like a five minute video but if you need

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.569 
like a five minute video but if you need
to<00:03:26.400> memorize<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.959> values<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.100> recommend

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
to memorize the values then I recommend

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.370 
to memorize the values then I recommend
this<00:03:29.819> let<00:03:30.180> me<00:03:30.269> show<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.079> what<00:03:31.200> I'm<00:03:31.290> talking
