but go ahead Richard made sure the
trench<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:45.379> 18<00:00:45.770> inches<00:00:46.010> deep<00:00:46.250> for<00:00:46.580> the<00:00:46.699> entire

trench was 18 inches deep for the entire
50<00:00:47.510> feet<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.080> it<00:00:48.199> wouldn't<00:00:48.410> be<00:00:48.680> washed<00:00:49.040> away<00:00:49.250> by

imagination well we're trying to keep
80-pound<00:01:10.820> cement<00:01:11.149> bags<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.750> falling<00:01:12.110> on<00:01:12.229> top

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
80-pound cement bags and falling on top

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.810 
80-pound cement bags and falling on top
of<00:01:12.590> our<00:01:12.710> guys<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.220> we're<00:01:13.340> sliding<00:01:13.640> them<00:01:13.790> down

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
of our guys so we're sliding them down

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.050 
of our guys so we're sliding them down
hill<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> tethered<00:01:14.979> shelf<00:01:15.979> where'd<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.940> get

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
hill on a tethered shelf where'd you get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.100 
hill on a tethered shelf where'd you get
that<00:01:17.119> idea<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.640> spot<00:01:19.880> thinking<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.479> two

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
that idea on the spot thinking with two

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.830 
that idea on the spot thinking with two
minutes<00:01:21.440> before<00:01:21.770> i<00:01:21.800> had<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:21.979> leave<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:23.690> you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
minutes before i had to leave just you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.940 
minutes before i had to leave just you
gotta<00:01:24.020> look<00:01:24.140> around<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.560> improvise

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
gotta look around and improvise

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.490 
gotta look around and improvise
sometimes<00:01:25.690> Richard<00:01:26.690> used<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.050> pole<00:01:27.259> that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
sometimes Richard used the pole that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.499 
sometimes Richard used the pole that
connects<00:01:27.800> my<00:01:27.890> hammock<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> maple<00:01:29.090> tree<00:01:29.119> as

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
connects my hammock to the maple tree as

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.320 
connects my hammock to the maple tree as
a<00:01:29.539> primitive<00:01:30.080> pulley<00:01:30.670> using<00:01:31.670> ropes<00:01:31.970> they

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
a primitive pulley using ropes they

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.389 
a primitive pulley using ropes they
could<00:01:32.539> slide<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.110> bags<00:01:33.350> down<00:01:33.500> on<00:01:33.890> plastic

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
could slide the bags down on plastic

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.639 
could slide the bags down on plastic
pallets<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.030> quickly<00:01:35.869> pull<00:01:36.170> them<00:01:36.319> up<00:01:36.440> again

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.160 

only<00:01:41.649> one<00:01:41.950> bag<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> concrete<00:01:43.000> broke<00:01:43.329> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
only one bag of concrete broke the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.830 
only one bag of concrete broke the
system<00:01:44.590> worked<00:01:44.829> now<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.789> most<00:01:46.060> difficult<00:01:46.720> and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
system worked now the most difficult and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.889 
system worked now the most difficult and
dangerous<00:01:47.049> part<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.770> operation<00:01:48.899> we're

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
dangerous part of the operation we're

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
dangerous part of the operation we're
going<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.079> dig<00:01:50.259> down<00:01:50.439> 18<00:01:50.979> inches<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.720> lay<00:01:52.720> pipe
