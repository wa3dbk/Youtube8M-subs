00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.130 
trying to see if there's any loose wires
I<00:00:25.289> took<00:00:26.289> there's<00:00:27.099> two<00:00:27.369> screws<00:00:27.550> up<00:00:27.819> here<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
I took there's two screws up here this

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.870 
I took there's two screws up here this
black<00:00:29.470> thing<00:00:29.499> is<00:00:29.859> on<00:00:30.009> this<00:00:30.189> black<00:00:30.489> thing<00:00:30.759> was

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
came right out four screws right here

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.720 
came right out four screws right here
one<00:00:39.670> two<00:00:40.000> three<00:00:40.480> four<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.920> kind<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.310> wiggled

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
one two three four and I kind of wiggled

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.300 
one two three four and I kind of wiggled
it<00:00:42.850> this<00:00:43.030> way<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.320> then<00:00:44.440> bump<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:44.920> reset

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
it this way and then bump the reset

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.660 
it this way and then bump the reset
thing<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:45.790> I<00:00:45.820> lost<00:00:46.150> track<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.540> my<00:00:46.690> gas<00:00:47.050> mileage

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
thing so I lost track of my gas mileage

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.900 
thing so I lost track of my gas mileage
you<00:00:48.670> can<00:00:48.850> just<00:00:49.030> kind<00:00:49.240> of<00:00:49.330> like<00:00:50.520> move<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.670> down

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
you can just kind of like move it down

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.180 
you can just kind of like move it down
this<00:00:52.180> way<00:00:52.390> then<00:00:52.870> sideways<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:53.830> can<00:00:53.980> take

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
this way then sideways and you can take

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.730 
this way then sideways and you can take
it<00:00:54.220> out<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:58.329> going<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.600> mark<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.200> numbers

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
it out so I'm going to mark the numbers

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.960 
it out so I'm going to mark the numbers
of<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.250> connectors<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:03.460> mark<00:01:03.700> with

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
of the connectors with the the mark with

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.170 
of the connectors with the the mark with
a<00:01:04.000> sharpie<00:01:04.480> here<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.950> they<00:01:06.850> don't<00:01:06.970> get

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
a sharpie here so that they don't get

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.590 
a sharpie here so that they don't get
mixed<00:01:07.330> up<00:01:08.310> sharpie<00:01:09.310> right<00:01:09.460> here<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.850> then

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
mixed up sharpie right here and then

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.550 
mixed up sharpie right here and then
I'll<00:01:10.810> continue<00:01:11.020> on<00:01:11.380> with<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.620> video

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I'll continue on with the video

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.080 
I'll continue on with the video
okay<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.010> can<00:01:15.159> see<00:01:15.310> I've<00:01:15.460> unplugged<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
okay so you can see I've unplugged the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.050 
okay so you can see I've unplugged the
connectors<00:01:16.570> after<00:01:16.930> marking<00:01:17.350> them<00:01:19.290> three

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
connectors after marking them three

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.319 
connectors after marking them three
three<00:01:22.060> over<00:01:22.360> here

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:44.000 

and<00:01:29.329> I've<00:01:29.509> taken<00:01:29.689> out<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:32.740> unit<00:01:33.740> here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.910 

all<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> contacts<00:01:45.510> are<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.900> flexible<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
all the contacts are really flexible and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.870 
all the contacts are really flexible and
thin<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:50.360> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.580> how<00:01:53.700> there

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
thin I can see how I can see how there

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.960 
thin I can see how I can see how there
may<00:01:54.120> be<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.330> bit<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> connection<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.820> also

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
may be a bit of connection but I also

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.680 
may be a bit of connection but I also
figured<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.780> light<00:01:58.020> bulbs<00:01:59.690> these

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
figured out these are light bulbs these

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.650 
figured out these are light bulbs these
have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.230> green<00:02:01.910> cover<00:02:02.910> over<00:02:03.330> them<00:02:03.510> to

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
have a little green cover over them to

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.500 
have a little green cover over them to
give<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.170> green<00:02:05.100> color<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.940> probably<00:02:06.300> to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
give the green color of the probably to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.030 
give the green color of the probably to
give<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.810> green<00:02:06.990> color<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.740> dash<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:10.040> so

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
give the green color of the dash and so

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.950 
give the green color of the dash and so
these<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> bad<00:02:11.910> connection<00:02:12.120> no<00:02:12.660> flicker

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
these have a bad connection no flicker

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.200 
these have a bad connection no flicker
on<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.200> off<00:02:13.470> or<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> light<00:02:14.580> bulb<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> bad

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
on and off or if the light bulb is bad

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.190 
on and off or if the light bulb is bad
you<00:02:15.480> probably<00:02:15.810> need<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.110> change<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:18.200> I'm

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you probably need to change it so I'm

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.680 
you probably need to change it so I'm
just<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:21.000> through<00:02:21.240> every<00:02:21.480> single

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
just going to go through every single

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.520 
just going to go through every single
one<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.990> these<00:02:22.170> probable<00:02:22.980> these<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
one of these probable these are all the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.590 
one of these probable these are all the
different<00:02:25.530> lights<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.700> bottom<00:02:27.120> these

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
different lights in the bottom these

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.780 
different lights in the bottom these
should<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.900> okay<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.520> through

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
should be okay I'm going to go through

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
should be okay I'm going to go through
these<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.780> there's<00:02:30.960> any<00:02:31.110> burned-out

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
these and see if there's any burned-out

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.100 
these and see if there's any burned-out
light<00:02:31.710> bulbs<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:34.340> hopefully<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:36.600> will<00:02:36.780> make<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
light bulbs and hopefully it will make a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.920 
light bulbs and hopefully it will make a
difference<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.300> might<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
difference but if not I might have to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
difference but if not I might have to
open<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.770> thing<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:42.209> close<00:02:43.760> make<00:02:44.760> sure

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
open this thing up to as close make sure

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
open this thing up to as close make sure
you<00:02:45.120> don't<00:02:46.340> okay<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> pause<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you don't okay I'm going to pause it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.670

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I'll be back okay so let's see what I've

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.220 
I'll be back okay so let's see what I've
done<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.550> checked<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.150> connectors<00:02:57.810> and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
done I checked all the connectors and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.920 
done I checked all the connectors and
you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.380> see<00:03:01.530> they<00:03:01.709> move<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.459> floppy<00:03:03.360> they

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
you can see they move like floppy they

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
you can see they move like floppy they
printed<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.650> circuit<00:03:05.130> which<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
printed on the circuit which is just a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.340 
printed on the circuit which is just a
between<00:03:07.730> sandwich<00:03:08.730> between<00:03:08.910> two<00:03:09.350> plastic

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
between sandwich between two plastic

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.180 
between sandwich between two plastic
layers<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.840> figured<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.890> one

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
layers so this I figured out this one

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.740 
layers so this I figured out this one
controls<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.709> light<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:18.120> cleaned<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.570> out

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
controls the light and I cleaned it out

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.770 
controls the light and I cleaned it out
I<00:03:19.519> tweaked<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> connectors<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.630> that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
I tweaked all the connectors so that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.820 
I tweaked all the connectors so that
they<00:03:22.040> pushed<00:03:23.040> harder<00:03:23.459> down<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:24.000> them<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.830> so

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
they pushed harder down on them and so

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.770 
they pushed harder down on them and so
far<00:03:27.410> I've<00:03:28.410> been<00:03:28.790> plugging<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.480> far

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
far I've been plugging it in and so far

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.280 
far I've been plugging it in and so far
it's<00:03:31.050> been<00:03:31.140> working<00:03:31.290> without<00:03:32.100> flickering<00:03:32.550> off

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
it's been working without flickering off

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's been working without flickering off
so<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.980> could<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.400> coincidence<00:03:35.730> because<00:03:36.269> it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
so it could be a coincidence because it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
so it could be a coincidence because it
does<00:03:37.530> flicker<00:03:37.830> on<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.130> off<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:39.209> been

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
does flicker on and off in it's been

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.650 
does flicker on and off in it's been
known<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:40.050> on<00:03:40.080> for<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> long<00:03:40.769> time<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:42.450> it

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
known to go on for a long time but it

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.729 
known to go on for a long time but it
seems<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:44.850> possible<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.250> fixed<00:03:48.739> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
seems it's possible that it's fixed it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.360 
seems it's possible that it's fixed it's
not

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
not

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.430 
not
I'm<00:03:52.360> going<00:03:52.569> to<00:03:52.629> have<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.840> take<00:03:53.049> this<00:03:53.230> whole

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
I'm going to have to take this whole

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.350 
I'm going to have to take this whole
thing<00:03:53.680> out<00:03:53.830> take<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:54.909> whole<00:03:55.120> thing<00:03:55.150> apart

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
thing out take this whole thing apart

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.030 
thing out take this whole thing apart
and<00:03:56.159> then<00:03:57.780> see<00:03:58.780> what<00:03:59.110> other<00:03:59.290> connectors<00:03:59.890> are

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and then see what other connectors are

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.850 
and then see what other connectors are
I'm<00:04:00.790> thinking<00:04:01.569> they<00:04:01.720> might<00:04:02.019> have<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
I'm thinking they might have the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.830 
I'm thinking they might have the
previous<00:04:03.250> owners<00:04:03.580> might<00:04:03.849> have<00:04:04.060> replaced<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
previous owners might have replaced the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.780 
previous owners might have replaced the
dials<00:04:07.840> with<00:04:08.049> indigo<00:04:08.650> dials<00:04:09.099> as<00:04:09.340> they<00:04:09.549> don't

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
dials with indigo dials as they don't

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.690 
dials with indigo dials as they don't
actually<00:04:10.000> let<00:04:10.360> light<00:04:10.569> through<00:04:11.159> but<00:04:12.159> I'm<00:04:12.400> not

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
actually let light through but I'm not

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.229 
actually let light through but I'm not
sure<00:04:13.030> if<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:13.420> car<00:04:13.750> came<00:04:14.079> with<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.379> or<00:04:14.500> not

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
sure if this car came with it or not

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.729 
sure if this car came with it or not
because<00:04:16.239> there's<00:04:16.600> two<00:04:16.900> light<00:04:17.199> bulbs<00:04:17.380> back

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
because there's two light bulbs back

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.860 
because there's two light bulbs back
there<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.280> are<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:19.000> ones<00:04:19.239> are<00:04:19.419> covered<00:04:19.630> in

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
there that are that ones are covered in

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 
there that are that ones are covered in
green<00:04:20.139> I'm<00:04:21.040> thinking<00:04:21.489> those<00:04:21.729> might<00:04:22.030> have

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
green I'm thinking those might have

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.159 
green I'm thinking those might have
shown<00:04:22.570> through<00:04:22.900> here<00:04:23.169> before<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:25.090> again<00:04:26.020> I'm

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
shown through here before but again I'm

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.210 
shown through here before but again I'm
not<00:04:26.199> sure<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:29.050> car<00:04:29.289> might<00:04:29.530> have<00:04:29.680> came<00:04:29.919> stock

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
not sure this car might have came stock

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.900 
not sure this car might have came stock
with<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.490> indigo<00:04:31.650> dials<00:04:32.650> or<00:04:32.860> they<00:04:33.460> could<00:04:33.760> have

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
with the indigo dials or they could have

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.800 
with the indigo dials or they could have
put<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.080> themselves<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.389> just<00:04:37.600> bought

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
put it in themselves so I just bought

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.439 
put it in themselves so I just bought
this<00:04:37.960> car<00:04:38.020> secondhand<00:04:39.010> can't<00:04:39.820> quite<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.300> too

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
this car secondhand can't quite be too

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.570 
this car secondhand can't quite be too
sure<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:41.650> hopefully<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.190> fixes<00:04:42.550> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
sure but hopefully that fixes the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.219 
sure but hopefully that fixes the
problem<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:44.260> that's<00:04:44.410> how<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:45.930> how<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:46.990> take

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
problem so that's how you how you take

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.580 
problem so that's how you how you take
apart<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> -<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.900> didn't<00:04:49.900> get<00:04:50.050> any<00:04:50.350> further

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
apart the - I didn't get any further

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.080 
apart the - I didn't get any further
than<00:04:50.889> that<00:04:50.919> hopefully<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.550> don't<00:04:51.639> need<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.139> but

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
than that hopefully I don't need to but

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.260 
than that hopefully I don't need to but
let<00:04:55.090> me<00:04:55.270> pause<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.229> here<00:04:56.380> for<00:04:56.530> now<00:04:56.650> let<00:04:57.070> me

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
let me pause this here for now let me

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.330 
let me pause this here for now let me
test<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.570> little<00:04:58.780> bit<00:04:58.900> more<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.340> if

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
test it a little bit more and if

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.890 
test it a little bit more and if
everything<00:05:00.669> works<00:05:00.880> I'm<00:05:01.180> going<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.570> put<00:05:01.810> it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
everything works I'm going to put it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.680 
everything works I'm going to put it
back<00:05:01.990> together<00:05:02.200> oh<00:05:03.090> yes<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:04.270> that<00:05:04.389> if<00:05:04.539> this

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
back together oh yes so that if this

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.400 
back together oh yes so that if this

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
to so far my plan is to make a lot of

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.150 
to so far my plan is to make a lot of
videos<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:18.190> hopefully<00:05:19.150> improve<00:05:20.160> improve

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
videos and hopefully improve improve

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.610 
videos and hopefully improve improve
with<00:05:21.490> practice<00:05:22.349> okay<00:05:24.479> okay<00:05:25.479> so<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.470> can<00:05:26.590> see

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
with practice okay okay so you can see

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.700 
with practice okay okay so you can see
it's<00:05:26.889> halfway<00:05:27.099> out<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.729> hole<00:05:27.910> but<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:29.169> had<00:05:29.530> to

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
it's halfway out the hole but I had to

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.129 
it's halfway out the hole but I had to
kind<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:30.130> push<00:05:30.430> them<00:05:30.610> in<00:05:30.820> while<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.180> was<00:05:31.419> uh<00:05:31.630> in

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
kind of push them in while I was uh in

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.450 
kind of push them in while I was uh in
this<00:05:32.380> position<00:05:33.389> I'm<00:05:34.389> not<00:05:34.449> sure<00:05:34.870> if<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.050> can<00:05:35.460> do

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
this position I'm not sure if you can do

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.450 
this position I'm not sure if you can do
it<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.760> then<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.949> guess<00:05:38.949> you<00:05:39.070> could<00:05:39.220> do<00:05:39.340> it

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
it and then I guess you could do it

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490 
it and then I guess you could do it
outside<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.000> then<00:05:40.150> push<00:05:40.330> them<00:05:40.449> in<00:05:40.630> if<00:05:41.199> it<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.470> a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
outside and then push them in if it is a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.060 
outside and then push them in if it is a
tight<00:05:41.830> squeeze<00:05:42.130> so<00:05:43.560> once<00:05:44.560> again<00:05:44.680> make<00:05:45.039> sure

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
tight squeeze so once again make sure

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.890 
tight squeeze so once again make sure
they're<00:05:45.370> nice<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.639> tight<00:05:45.970> because<00:05:46.389> these

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
they're nice and tight because these

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.750 
they're nice and tight because these
connectors<00:05:47.410> are<00:05:47.650> easily<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.340> have<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:48.490> bad

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
connectors are easily to have a bad

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.969 
connectors are easily to have a bad
connection<00:05:48.970> because<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.139> nature<00:05:50.590> of<00:05:50.740> the

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
connection because of the nature of the

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.659 
connection because of the nature of the
way<00:05:51.130> they're<00:05:51.310> built<00:05:51.660> so<00:05:53.099> put<00:05:54.099> that<00:05:54.130> in<00:05:54.280> I'm

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
way they're built so put that in I'm

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.940 
way they're built so put that in I'm
going<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.740> reposition<00:05:56.740> this<00:05:57.220> back<00:05:57.430> in

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
going to reposition this back in

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.580 
going to reposition this back in
just<00:05:59.950> for<00:06:00.220> screws<00:06:00.840> I'm<00:06:01.840> going<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.140> put<00:06:02.260> them<00:06:02.380> in

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
just for screws I'm going to put them in
