up<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.389> corn<00:00:03.899> snakes<00:00:04.200> tank<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:05.870> just<00:00:06.870> fed<00:00:07.259> him

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
up my corn snakes tank I just fed him

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.980 
up my corn snakes tank I just fed him
he's<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.980> there<00:00:08.309> but<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.210> gonna<00:00:09.389> push<00:00:09.719> down

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
he's in there but I'm gonna push down

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.999 
he's in there but I'm gonna push down
the<00:00:10.260> mouse<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> clean<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.950> his

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the mouse and so I had to clean out his

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.470 
the mouse and so I had to clean out his
tank<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.519> figured<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.880> might<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.059> well<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
tank so I figured I might as well do a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.980 
tank so I figured I might as well do a
video<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.230> how<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:17.090> set<00:00:18.090> up<00:00:18.119> their<00:00:18.390> tank<00:00:18.720> it's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
video on how to set up their tank it's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.849 
video on how to set up their tank it's
pretty<00:00:19.199> simple<00:00:19.710> they're<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:21.470> set<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
pretty simple they're not to set up and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.519 
pretty simple they're not to set up and
see<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> lean<00:00:24.210> my<00:00:24.449> iPod<00:00:24.930> across<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
see if I can lean my iPod across the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.210 
see if I can lean my iPod across the
tank<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.180> would<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.599> hold<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.070> go

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
bedding get it from Petco just get like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.310 
bedding get it from Petco just get like
two<00:00:44.160> inches<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.149> nut<00:00:45.539> no<00:00:45.809> maybe<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.140> two

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
two inches on this nut no maybe not two

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.050 
two inches on this nut no maybe not two
inches<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.800> close

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.680 

it's<00:00:56.060> not<00:00:56.240> too<00:00:56.420> expensive<00:00:56.450> it's<00:00:57.200> like<00:00:58.690> ten

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
it's not too expensive it's like ten

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's not too expensive it's like ten
bucks<00:00:59.960> for<00:01:00.320> this<00:01:01.840> this<00:01:02.840> size

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.800 

it<00:01:06.710> says<00:01:07.160> not<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.490> wasn't<00:01:07.730> too<00:01:07.790> bad<00:01:08.530> but

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
it says not it wasn't too bad but

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.740 
it says not it wasn't too bad but
basically<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:11.930> put<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.470> there<00:01:13.630> spread<00:01:14.630> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
basically just put it in there spread it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.170 
basically just put it in there spread it
around<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.830> not<00:01:16.130> enough<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.610> want<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.060> put

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
around this is not enough I want to put

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:28.500 
around this is not enough I want to put
more<00:01:17.300> hair<00:01:17.510> but<00:01:17.800> it's<00:01:18.800> pretty<00:01:19.040> simple<00:01:19.750> I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.850 

should<00:01:29.510> have<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.750> thermometer<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.440> both<00:01:30.590> sides

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
should have a thermometer on both sides

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.810 
should have a thermometer on both sides
but<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.130> don't<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.510> probably<00:01:32.750> should<00:01:33.170> have

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
but I don't and I probably should have

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.010 
but I don't and I probably should have
humidity<00:01:34.820> but<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:36.500> not<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.680> huge<00:01:37.190> deal

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
humidity but it's not a huge deal

00:01:38.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
humidity but it's not a huge deal
because<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:39.320> not<00:01:39.470> overly<00:01:39.979> human<00:01:40.460> my<00:01:46.300> see

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.690 

all<00:02:08.040> right

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

have a normal light inside of that
casing<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:48.190> gets<00:05:48.400> right<00:05:49.030> around<00:05:49.540> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
casing and it gets right around the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.690 
casing and it gets right around the
correct<00:05:50.260> temporary<00:05:50.680> cooled<00:05:50.980> down<00:05:51.190> right<00:05:51.520> now

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
correct temporary cooled down right now

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.390 
correct temporary cooled down right now
because<00:05:52.060> uh<00:05:52.680> because<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.710> had<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.070> light<00:05:54.250> off

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
because uh because I had the light off

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.950 
because uh because I had the light off
but<00:05:54.580> he<00:05:54.640> gets<00:05:54.760> right<00:05:55.480> around<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.810> right

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
but he gets right around the right

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.850 
but he gets right around the right
temperature<00:05:56.350> for<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.590> outside<00:05:56.920> and

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
temperature for the outside and

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.020 
temperature for the outside and
10-gallon<00:05:59.860> is<00:05:59.980> big<00:06:00.190> enough<00:06:00.370> for<00:06:00.430> him<00:06:00.730> for

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
10-gallon is big enough for him for

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.460 
10-gallon is big enough for him for
probably<00:06:01.630> until<00:06:01.780> he's<00:06:01.900> about<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.080> year<00:06:02.140> old

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
probably until he's about a year old

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.610 
probably until he's about a year old
maybe<00:06:02.860> a<00:06:02.950> little<00:06:03.130> bit<00:06:03.250> more<00:06:03.400> than<00:06:03.610> that

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
maybe a little bit more than that

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.960 
maybe a little bit more than that
so<00:06:05.790> yeah<00:06:06.790> it's<00:06:07.570> about<00:06:07.750> it
