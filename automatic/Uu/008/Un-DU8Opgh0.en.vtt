Jeff<00:00:10.410> Loomis<00:00:10.620> uses<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.639> bed

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
Jeff Loomis uses it a lot in bed

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.629 
Jeff Loomis uses it a lot in bed
Malmsteen<00:00:12.300> uses<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.870> over<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> place<00:00:13.639> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
Malmsteen uses it all over the place and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.279 
Malmsteen uses it all over the place and
it's<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:15.030> good<00:00:15.240> great<00:00:15.570> shape<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.020> kind<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's really good great shape to kind of

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.340 
it's really good great shape to kind of
connect<00:00:16.650> different<00:00:16.980> places<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> neck

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
connect different places on the neck

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.870 
connect different places on the neck
because<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:19.770> easy<00:00:19.890> shape<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
because it's a really easy shape to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.250 
because it's a really easy shape to
learn<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.689> speed<00:00:21.960> through

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
learn and kind of speed through

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.529 
learn and kind of speed through
different<00:00:22.590> positions<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:24.330> we're<00:00:24.420> going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
different positions so what we're going

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.970 
different positions so what we're going
to<00:00:24.600> start<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.490> your<00:00:26.490> basic<00:00:26.880> D<00:00:27.689> fold<00:00:28.529> fully

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to start with is your basic D fold fully

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580 
to start with is your basic D fold fully

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
string your hammer on to the 10th fret

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
string your hammer on to the 10th fret
of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.000> first<00:00:48.270> string<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.170> gonna<00:00:49.289> end

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of the first string so you're gonna end

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.760 
of the first string so you're gonna end
up<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> once<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> get

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
up with this so once you kind of get

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
up with this so once you kind of get
that<00:00:55.949> shape<00:00:56.250> together<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.820> moving<00:01:01.070> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that shape together and moving it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
that shape together and moving it's
really<00:01:02.399> easy<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.879> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> together

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
really easy to kind of put it together

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
really easy to kind of put it together
in<00:01:04.110> sequential<00:01:04.619> patterns<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.510> because<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
in sequential patterns so because the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.030 
in sequential patterns so because the
cool<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.260> diminished<00:01:07.680> 7th<00:01:07.979> chord

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
cool thing about a diminished 7th chord

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
cool thing about a diminished 7th chord
is<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> repeats<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.479> exact<00:01:09.840> same<00:01:10.110> notes<00:01:10.409> every

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
is it repeats the exact same notes every

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
is it repeats the exact same notes every
three<00:01:11.430> frets<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> start<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
three frets so if we want to start on

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.300 
three frets so if we want to start on
down<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.479> 4th<00:01:16.229> fret<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:16.830> g<00:01:17.070> string

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
down on the 4th fret of your g string

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
down on the 4th fret of your g string
which<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> B<00:01:18.659> diminished<00:01:19.110> 7th

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
which is going to be a B diminished 7th

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
which is going to be a B diminished 7th
chord<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> connect<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:23.000> moving<00:01:24.000> all

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
chord you can connect that moving all

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
chord you can connect that moving all
the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> back<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> neck<00:01:25.590> really

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the way up and back down the neck really

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
the way up and back down the neck really
easily<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> something<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.119> call<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
easily which is something I call the in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
easily which is something I call the in
Gaelic<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.619> something<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
Gaelic because it's something these is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
Gaelic because it's something these is
all<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> time<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> start<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.530> 4th<00:01:31.890> fret<00:01:32.189> of

all the time to start on the 4th fret of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.370 
all the time to start on the 4th fret of
your<00:01:32.400> third<00:01:32.670> string<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> ascend<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
your third string and ascend that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
your third string and ascend that
diminished<00:01:34.860> seven<00:01:35.130> arpeggio<00:01:35.430> shape<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
diminished seven arpeggio shape that we

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.310 
diminished seven arpeggio shape that we
learned<00:01:36.479> earlier<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:38.180> 7th<00:01:39.180> fret<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.990> first

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
learned earlier a 7th fret of the first

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
learned earlier a 7th fret of the first
string<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.009> slide<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.960> fourth

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.980 
finger up to the 10th fret of the first
string<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.000> descend<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> same

string then then descend down that same
arpeggio<00:01:49.500> shape<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.829> either

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
arpeggio shape and then you can either

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.149 
arpeggio shape and then you can either
hammer<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.479> 10th<00:01:54.810> fret<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.350> slide<00:01:56.009> up
