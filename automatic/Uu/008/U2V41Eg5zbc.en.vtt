reassure you that this is the best thing

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
reassure you that this is the best thing
to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.949> done<00:00:53.160> because<00:00:53.730> those<00:00:54.300> benefits<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to be done because those benefits so

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.430 
to be done because those benefits so
outweigh<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.070> risks<00:00:56.750> one<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> can

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
outweigh the risks one thing that can

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.619 
outweigh the risks one thing that can
happen<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.879> metabolic<00:01:00.420> rate

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
happen is because the metabolic rate

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
happen is because the metabolic rate
goes<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:00.960> slightly<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.340> tend<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> put

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
goes down slightly they can tend to put

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
goes down slightly they can tend to put
weight<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
weight on a little bit but this is so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090 
weight on a little bit but this is so
easily<00:01:05.689> compensated<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.960> by<00:01:07.170> reducing<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
easily compensated for by reducing the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
easily compensated for by reducing the
amount<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.760> feed<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.420> even<00:01:10.140> better<00:01:10.409> by

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
amount that you feed and even better by

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.580 
amount that you feed and even better by
feeding<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> diet<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.850> designed

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
feeding a diet that's designed

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.890
