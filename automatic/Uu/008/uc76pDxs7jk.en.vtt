minecraft server mainly everybody knows

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.009 
minecraft server mainly everybody knows
how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.179> pretty<00:00:12.330> obvious<00:00:12.809> but

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
how to do that it's pretty obvious but

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.609 
how to do that it's pretty obvious but
this<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.240> can't<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> server

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
this one is like you can't have a server

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.950 
this one is like you can't have a server
connect<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.550> internet<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.750> can't

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
connect to the internet and you can't

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.410 
connect to the internet and you can't
have<00:00:19.080> your<00:00:19.170> friends<00:00:19.740> connect<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.640> this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.339 

because<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.609> doesn't<00:02:06.640> have<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.450> folders<00:02:08.050> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.220 

just<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:16.239> should<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.569> looking<00:03:17.049> like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
just so that it should be looking like

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.350 
just so that it should be looking like
that<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.680> then<00:03:17.860> i<00:03:18.220> recommend<00:03:18.790> putting<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
that and then i recommend putting in a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630 
that and then i recommend putting in a
seed<00:03:19.599> doesn't<00:03:19.989> matter<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:21.159> want<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.400> save

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
seed doesn't matter and you want to save

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.250 
seed doesn't matter and you want to save
that<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.330> i'm<00:03:22.540> not<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.870> say<00:03:23.019> that

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
that but i'm not going to say that

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.690 
that but i'm not going to say that
because<00:03:23.379> i<00:03:23.500> already<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.980> my<00:03:24.220> own<00:03:24.580> now<00:03:26.700> now

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250

there<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:54.610> if<00:05:55.030> you<00:05:55.150> have<00:05:55.300> mcafee<00:05:55.659> i<00:05:56.139> recommend

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
there and if you have mcafee i recommend

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.649 
there and if you have mcafee i recommend
getting<00:05:57.129> mcafee<00:05:57.729> because<00:05:57.939> it's<00:05:58.090> way<00:05:58.270> easier

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
getting mcafee because it's way easier

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.670 
getting mcafee because it's way easier
when<00:05:58.870> you<00:05:58.990> have<00:05:59.319> stuff<00:05:59.949> like<00:06:00.069> that<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.840> if<00:06:02.199> this
