in<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.840> demo<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.560> want<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.100> take<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> look<00:00:08.670> at

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
in this demo I want to take a look at

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.590 
in this demo I want to take a look at
one<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.059> my<00:00:09.300> favorite<00:00:10.139> tools<00:00:10.820> channel<00:00:11.820> Iser

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
one of my favorite tools channel Iser

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.140 
one of my favorite tools channel Iser
and<00:00:12.840> what<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:14.100> is<00:00:14.369> I'm<00:00:14.699> going<00:00:14.760> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
be<00:00:15.299> using<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.199> wireless<00:00:17.190> adapter<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
be using a wireless adapter and I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800 
be using a wireless adapter and I
brought<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.430> website<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.760> meta<00:00:21.449> geeks

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
brought up here a website of meta geeks

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.829 
brought up here a website of meta geeks
and<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.919> see<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> different

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
and you can see up here the different

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.980 
and you can see up here the different
types<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.349> adapters<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.279> I've<00:00:26.999> plugged<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.869> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
types of adapters so I've plugged one of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
types of adapters so I've plugged one of
these<00:00:28.140> adapters<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.820> actually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
these adapters in and I'm actually

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.860 
these adapters in and I'm actually
running<00:00:30.480> channel<00:00:31.349> Iser<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> let's<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
running channel Iser for so let's take a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
running channel Iser for so let's take a
look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> brought<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
look at that now so I brought up the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
look at that now so I brought up the
channel<00:00:37.350> eyes<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.310> you<00:00:38.970> can<00:00:39.000> see

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
channel eyes at all and you can see

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.950 
channel eyes at all and you can see
already<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.530> starting<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.370> pick<00:00:41.610> up

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
already that is starting to pick up

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.190 
already that is starting to pick up
signals<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.950> 2.4<00:00:44.700> gigahertz<00:00:44.760> band<00:00:45.630> now

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
signals in the 2.4 gigahertz band now

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.230 
signals in the 2.4 gigahertz band now
how<00:00:46.380> do<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.560> know<00:00:46.650> this<00:00:47.040> is<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.310> 2.4<00:00:47.970> gigahertz

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
how do I know this is the 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.890 
how do I know this is the 2.4 gigahertz
band<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:49.560> here<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.550> displaying<00:00:51.330> the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
band see here is displaying the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.530 
band see here is displaying the
different<00:00:52.320> frequencies<00:00:52.980> across<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.790> 2.4

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540

difference between an ad hoc and
infrastructure<00:01:48.209> later<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.319> if<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:50.100> look<00:01:50.369> here

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
infrastructure later on if I look here

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.059 
infrastructure later on if I look here
at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.999> data<00:01:51.240> rates<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.530> tell<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.799> by

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
at the data rates I can tell just by

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.770 
at the data rates I can tell just by
looking<00:01:53.459> at<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.639> data<00:01:53.850> rates<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> these<00:01:54.569> are

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
looking at the data rates that these are

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.090 
looking at the data rates that these are
all<00:01:55.049> 802<00:01:55.889> 11<00:01:55.920> n<00:01:56.600> because<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.259> G<00:01:58.499> only<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:59.069> up

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
all 802 11 n because a and G only go up

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.059 
all 802 11 n because a and G only go up
to<00:01:59.280> 54<00:01:59.909> megabits<00:02:00.359> per<00:02:00.479> second<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.200> B<00:02:01.799> only

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
to 54 megabits per second and B only

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.300 
to 54 megabits per second and B only
goes<00:02:02.429> up<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.939> 11<00:02:03.119> megabits<00:02:03.810> per<00:02:04.020> second<00:02:04.529> so

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
goes up to 11 megabits per second so

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.099 
goes up to 11 megabits per second so
let's<00:02:05.579> take<00:02:05.819> a<00:02:05.850> look<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.749> these<00:02:06.899> look

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
let's take a look at what these look

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.290 
let's take a look at what these look
like<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.859> click<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.300> avals

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
like I'm going to click on avals

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
like I'm going to click on avals
networks<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:11.510> we're<00:02:12.510> display<00:02:12.990> those

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
networks here and we're display those

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.360 
networks here and we're display those
and<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.530> channel<00:02:17.069> 1

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and here you can see this is channel 1

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.980 
and here you can see this is channel 1
and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.460 
and
here<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.880> is<00:02:21.120> channel<00:02:21.690> 7<00:02:22.320> and

11 and if you don't believe me on the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.590 
11 and if you don't believe me on the
channels<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.250> change<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.820> view<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
channels I can change the view here and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.630 
channels I can change the view here and
just<00:02:28.290> say<00:02:28.470> oh<00:02:28.500> rather<00:02:29.010> than<00:02:29.250> having

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
just say oh rather than having

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.820 
just say oh rather than having
frequencies<00:02:30.360> displayed<00:02:30.780> let<00:02:31.050> me<00:02:31.200> display<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
frequencies displayed let me display the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
channels and now you can see and for the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.650 
channels and now you can see and for the
main<00:02:35.430> thing<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.670> wanted<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> point<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.420> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
main thing I wanted to point out you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.190 
main thing I wanted to point out you
here<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.520> deploying<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.510> channel<00:02:40.020> 1

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
here with this is deploying on channel 1

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160 
here with this is deploying on channel 1
and<00:02:40.380> he's<00:02:40.590> using<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.370> 20<00:02:41.970> megahertz<00:02:42.390> band<00:02:42.930> see

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
and he's using a 20 megahertz band see

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
and he's using a 20 megahertz band see
how<00:02:43.290> he's<00:02:43.440> spreading<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.190> signal<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> 20

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
how he's spreading that signal of a 20

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.530 
how he's spreading that signal of a 20
megahertz<00:02:45.390> band<00:02:45.890> whereas<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
megahertz band whereas up here in the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.690 
megahertz band whereas up here in the
higher<00:02:48.780> part<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> 2.4<00:02:50.010> gigahertz<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
higher part of the 2.4 gigahertz and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.660 
higher part of the 2.4 gigahertz and
I've<00:02:51.300> got<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> 14<00:02:52.560> megahertz<00:02:53.070> channels<00:02:53.130> as

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
I've got a 14 megahertz channels as

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.700 
I've got a 14 megahertz channels as
twice<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.180> wide<00:02:55.160> operating<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.370> channel<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.710> 7

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
twice as wide operating on channel and 7

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.920 
twice as wide operating on channel and 7
and<00:02:58.920> 11<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.760> added<00:03:00.210> those<00:03:00.390> two<00:03:00.660> channels

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
and 11 so it's added those two channels

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.700 
and 11 so it's added those two channels
together<00:03:01.640> now<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:03.000> also<00:03:03.330> hear<00:03:03.930> display<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
together now I can also hear display the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.330 
together now I can also hear display the
iMac<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.060> turn<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:08.130> can

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
iMac here I turn that one on and you can

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.420 
iMac here I turn that one on and you can
see<00:03:08.550> that's<00:03:08.760> deployed<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.540> channel<00:03:10.140> 5<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.770> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
see that's deployed on channel 5 and you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.170 
see that's deployed on channel 5 and you
can<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.360> overlaps<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:14.400> my<00:03:14.790> other

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
can see that it overlaps with my other

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.900 
can see that it overlaps with my other
access<00:03:15.840> points<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:16.620> when<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.580> that

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
access points and so when you see that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
access points and so when you see that
you<00:03:18.240> know<00:03:18.450> those<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.960> going<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.230> cause

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
you know those are going to cause

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.670 
you know those are going to cause
interference<00:03:20.190> with<00:03:21.060> each<00:03:21.240> other<00:03:21.570> let<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
interference with each other let me just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.640 
interference with each other let me just
turn<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.190> imac<00:03:23.730> off<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.260> other<00:03:25.410> thing<00:03:25.560> i

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
turn the imac off so the other thing i

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.220 
turn the imac off so the other thing i
wanted<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.040> show<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.370> was<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.660> kinds<00:03:28.140> of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
wanted to show you was the kinds of

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.880 
wanted to show you was the kinds of
signatures<00:03:28.860> now<00:03:29.190> i<00:03:29.460> can<00:03:30.210> tell<00:03:30.540> by<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:31.050> square

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
signatures now i can tell by the square

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.420 
signatures now i can tell by the square
shape<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.580> these<00:03:33.300> signals<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.430> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
shape of these signals like this the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.210 
shape of these signals like this the
square<00:03:35.910> shape<00:03:36.240> here<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.740> an<00:03:37.920> earth

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
square shape here that this is an earth

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.700 
square shape here that this is an earth
DM<00:03:38.670> signal<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.320> different<00:03:40.830> radios<00:03:41.730> have

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
DM signal and so different radios have

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.060 
DM signal and so different radios have
different<00:03:44.240> signatures<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.350> by<00:03:46.620> looking

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
different signatures and so by looking

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.340 
different signatures and so by looking
at<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> signatures<00:03:47.880> i<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.720> kind<00:03:48.990> of<00:03:49.080> tell

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
at the signatures i can kind of tell

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830 
at the signatures i can kind of tell
what<00:03:49.560> might<00:03:49.770> be<00:03:49.950> transmitting<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.390> if<00:03:51.510> i<00:03:51.570> come

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
what might be transmitting so if i come

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.190 
what might be transmitting so if i come
down<00:03:52.110> here<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:52.740> here<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.790> can<00:03:54.000> see<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.870> types

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
down here but here you can see the types

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.280 
down here but here you can see the types
of<00:03:55.410> things<00:03:55.650> see<00:03:55.890> this<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.280> an<00:03:56.460> an<00:03:56.730> 802<00:03:57.450> 11<00:03:57.630> b

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
of things see this is an an 802 11 b

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.550 
of things see this is an an 802 11 b
radio<00:03:58.620> gives<00:03:59.130> me<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.430> kind<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.820> curved<00:04:00.560> look

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
radio gives me this kind of curved look

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.450 
radio gives me this kind of curved look
to<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.100> i<00:04:02.400> come<00:04:03.330> down<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.660> bit<00:04:03.960> more<00:04:04.190> here's<00:04:05.190> some

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
to it i come down a bit more here's some

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.020 
to it i come down a bit more here's some
examples<00:04:06.060> here<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.510> cordless<00:04:06.960> phone<00:04:08.030> this

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
examples here of a cordless phone this

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.410 
examples here of a cordless phone this
is<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.270> nerve<00:04:09.510> DM<00:04:10.200> signal<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.420> Motorola's

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
is a nerve DM signal this is Motorola's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.900 
is a nerve DM signal this is Motorola's
canopy<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.290> uses<00:04:13.710> in<00:04:13.890> OFDM<00:04:14.130> system

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
canopy and that uses in OFDM system

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.280 
canopy and that uses in OFDM system
different<00:04:15.510> from<00:04:16.170> 802<00:04:16.709> 11<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.880> similar<00:04:18.780> signal

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
different from 802 11 but similar signal

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.110 
different from 802 11 but similar signal
because<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.680> still<00:04:19.859> nerve<00:04:20.130> DM<00:04:20.489> structure

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
because it's still nerve DM structure

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.010 
because it's still nerve DM structure
and<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:22.109> different<00:04:22.860> radios<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:24.020> different

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and so different radios have different

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.060 
and so different radios have different
patterns<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.570> again<00:04:27.800> come<00:04:28.800> down<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
patterns and so here again come down a

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.240 
patterns and so here again come down a
bit<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.669> start<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.120> see<00:04:30.300> videos<00:04:30.750> etc

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
bit I can start to see videos etc

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.670 
bit I can start to see videos etc
so<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.400> can<00:04:32.580> literally<00:04:32.880> profile<00:04:33.680> different

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
so I can literally profile different

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.110 
so I can literally profile different
pieces<00:04:34.920> of<00:04:35.100> equipment<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.670> could<00:04:35.940> be

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
pieces of equipment that could be

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.780 
pieces of equipment that could be
operating<00:04:36.660> in<00:04:36.780> my<00:04:36.930> band<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.310> click<00:04:38.640> over

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
operating in my band so if I click over

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.930 
operating in my band so if I click over
here<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.170> button<00:04:40.500> here<00:04:40.620> I'm<00:04:41.400> going<00:04:41.820> to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
here on this button here I'm going to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.480 
here on this button here I'm going to
display<00:04:42.480> what<00:04:43.200> else<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.620> happening<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
display what else is happening in the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.690 
display what else is happening in the
2.4<00:04:45.210> gigahertz<00:04:45.540> band<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.860> can<00:04:47.190> see<00:04:47.400> my<00:04:47.640> two

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
2.4 gigahertz band so you can see my two

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.110 
2.4 gigahertz band so you can see my two
access<00:04:48.480> points<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:49.710> now<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.920> can<00:04:50.280> see<00:04:50.550> wow

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
access points but now you can see wow

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.420 
access points but now you can see wow
what<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:51.810> thing<00:04:52.350> jumping<00:04:52.920> all<00:04:53.040> over<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
what is this thing jumping all over the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.910 
what is this thing jumping all over the
place<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.570> could<00:04:54.810> look<00:04:54.990> down<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:55.800> of

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
place and I could look down here one of

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.370 
place and I could look down here one of
these<00:04:56.040> profiles<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:57.270> say<00:04:57.480> well<00:04:57.720> gee<00:04:57.960> does<00:04:58.230> it

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
these profiles and say well gee does it

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.130 
these profiles and say well gee does it
fit<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.250> these<00:04:59.340> profiles<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.420> so

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
fit with one of these profiles and so

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.750 
fit with one of these profiles and so
you<00:05:01.200> can<00:05:01.410> come<00:05:01.620> down<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.920> say<00:05:02.220> well<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.610> know

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
you can come down and say well you know

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.610 
you can come down and say well you know
is<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.540> cordless<00:05:03.840> phone

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
is it a cordless phone

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.800 
is it a cordless phone
yeah<00:05:05.400> could<00:05:05.790> it<00:05:05.910> be<00:05:06.090> this<00:05:06.360> AV<00:05:06.930> transmitter<00:05:08.810> you

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
yeah could it be this AV transmitter you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.560 
yeah could it be this AV transmitter you
know<00:05:10.190> could<00:05:11.190> it<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> headset<00:05:12.000> that's<00:05:12.210> going

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
know could it be a headset that's going

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.640 
know could it be a headset that's going
on<00:05:12.660> here<00:05:13.080> now<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.580> keep<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:14.970> out<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.650> suspense

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
on here now to keep you out of suspense

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.850 
on here now to keep you out of suspense
as<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.160> what<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.640> actually<00:05:17.910> is<00:05:18.180> is<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.650> is

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
as to what this actually is is this is

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.050 
as to what this actually is is this is
actually<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:21.140> proprietary<00:05:22.140> technology<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.370> so

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
actually a proprietary technology and so

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.970 
actually a proprietary technology and so
this<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.450> a<00:05:24.480> technology<00:05:25.140> which<00:05:25.320> would<00:05:25.440> be<00:05:25.680> de

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
this is a technology which would be de

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.909 
this is a technology which would be de
difficult<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:27.480> actually<00:05:27.900> determine<00:05:28.380> what<00:05:28.800> it

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
difficult to actually determine what it

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.070 
difficult to actually determine what it
is<00:05:29.010> based<00:05:29.370> on<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.730> signatures<00:05:30.240> because<00:05:30.750> this

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
is based on the signatures because this

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.500 
is based on the signatures because this
is<00:05:31.230> actually<00:05:31.910> propriety<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.150> not<00:05:33.360> an

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
is actually propriety and it's not an

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.050 
is actually propriety and it's not an
earned<00:05:33.750> signature<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:35.190> is<00:05:35.370> actually<00:05:35.850> my

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
earned signature this is actually my

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.990 
earned signature this is actually my
solar<00:05:36.540> power<00:05:36.990> system<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:38.370> run<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.669> solar

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
solar power system and I run a solar

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.490 
solar power system and I run a solar
power<00:05:39.360> system<00:05:39.480> on<00:05:40.110> my<00:05:40.350> home<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.940> is

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
power system on my home and it is

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.050 
power system on my home and it is
transmitting<00:05:43.500> updates<00:05:44.400> as<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.760> how<00:05:44.910> much

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
transmitting updates as to how much

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.260 
transmitting updates as to how much
energy<00:05:45.690> I'm<00:05:45.990> generating<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.310> so<00:05:47.820> that's<00:05:48.060> what

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
energy I'm generating and so that's what

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.110 
energy I'm generating and so that's what
you're<00:05:48.450> seeing<00:05:48.780> in<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.440> band<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.400> if<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:50.820> look

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
you're seeing in the band and if I look

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.370 
you're seeing in the band and if I look
here<00:05:51.570> at<00:05:51.840> my<00:05:52.590> y-axis<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:54.330> can<00:05:54.570> see<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.080> power

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
here at my y-axis you can see the power

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.770 
here at my y-axis you can see the power
level<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.070> transmitting<00:05:56.820> at<00:05:56.940> as<00:05:57.240> the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
level that is transmitting at as the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.680 
level that is transmitting at as the
kind<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.530> impact<00:05:59.130> is<00:05:59.430> going<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.120> have<00:06:00.390> on

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
kind of the impact is going to have on

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.950 
kind of the impact is going to have on
my<00:06:01.080> Wi-Fi<00:06:01.800> system<00:06:02.570> remember<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.840> way

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
my Wi-Fi system remember that the way

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.980 
my Wi-Fi system remember that the way
Wi-Fi<00:06:04.590> operates<00:06:05.250> is<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:06.120> gonna<00:06:06.300> listen<00:06:06.660> and

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
Wi-Fi operates is it's gonna listen and

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.560 
Wi-Fi operates is it's gonna listen and
it<00:06:07.169> will<00:06:07.290> only<00:06:07.530> transmit<00:06:08.220> if<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.910> doesn't<00:06:09.210> hear

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
it will only transmit if it doesn't hear

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.010 
it will only transmit if it doesn't hear
any<00:06:09.720> noise<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.710> band<00:06:11.510> first<00:06:12.510> turn<00:06:12.810> off<00:06:12.840> my

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
any noise in the band first turn off my

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.900 
any noise in the band first turn off my
you<00:06:13.680> can<00:06:13.800> just<00:06:13.979> say<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:14.250> go<00:06:14.370> back<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.760> my

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
you can just say and go back to my

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.810 
you can just say and go back to my
network<00:06:15.270> table<00:06:15.990> so<00:06:16.860> I<00:06:16.890> just<00:06:17.190> want<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.550> close

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
network table so I just want to close

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.909 
network table so I just want to close
that<00:06:17.850> I<00:06:18.690> don't<00:06:19.560> want<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.830> save<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.250> file<00:06:20.520> and

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
that I don't want to save the file and

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.130 
that I don't want to save the file and
again<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.280> pick<00:06:23.640> up<00:06:23.850> those<00:06:24.060> signals<00:06:24.600> all<00:06:24.900> I've

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
again to pick up those signals all I've

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.700 
again to pick up those signals all I've
done<00:06:25.350> is<00:06:25.680> I've<00:06:26.160> added<00:06:26.940> in<00:06:27.300> my<00:06:27.750> wireless

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
done is I've added in my wireless

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.219 
done is I've added in my wireless
adapter<00:06:29.840> I'm<00:06:30.840> running<00:06:31.350> channel<00:06:32.070> Iser<00:06:32.280> 4<00:06:32.880> as<00:06:33.229> my

adapter I'm running channel Iser 4 as my

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.790 
adapter I'm running channel Iser 4 as my
application<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.750> I'm<00:06:36.750> picking<00:06:37.169> up<00:06:37.470> signals

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
application and I'm picking up signals

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.450 
application and I'm picking up signals
in<00:06:38.190> the<00:06:38.430> 2.4<00:06:39.120> gigahertz<00:06:39.180> band<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:40.470> you<00:06:41.250> can

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
in the 2.4 gigahertz band and you can

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.150 
in the 2.4 gigahertz band and you can
see<00:06:41.729> that<00:06:42.180> 802<00:06:42.780> 11<00:06:42.930> n<00:06:43.620> uses<00:06:44.430> a

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
see that 802 11 n uses a

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.220 
see that 802 11 n uses a
twenty<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.790> a<00:06:45.970> fourteen<00:06:46.540> megahertz<00:06:47.110> channels

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
twenty and a fourteen megahertz channels

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.820 
twenty and a fourteen megahertz channels
in<00:06:48.010> the<00:06:48.730> 2.4<00:06:49.690> gigahertz

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
in the 2.4 gigahertz

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.130 
in the 2.4 gigahertz
so<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.700> main<00:06:51.850> thing<00:06:52.120> here<00:06:52.360> is<00:06:52.480> to<00:06:52.510> understand

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
so the main thing here is to understand

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.500 
so the main thing here is to understand
the<00:06:53.770> frequency<00:06:54.340> band<00:06:54.580> that<00:06:54.760> I'm<00:06:54.970> looking<00:06:55.150> at

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
the frequency band that I'm looking at

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.810 
the frequency band that I'm looking at
and<00:06:55.780> then<00:06:56.350> that<00:06:56.560> my<00:06:56.710> signals<00:06:57.280> actually

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
and then that my signals actually

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.020 
and then that my signals actually
operate<00:06:58.450> across<00:06:59.410> a<00:06:59.530> band<00:06:59.980> in<00:07:00.370> the<00:07:00.580> case<00:07:00.820> of

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
operate across a band in the case of

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.980 
operate across a band in the case of
Wi-Fi<00:07:01.540> that's<00:07:02.200> a<00:07:02.380> 20<00:07:02.950> or<00:07:03.190> a<00:07:03.420> 14<00:07:04.420> megahertz

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
Wi-Fi that's a 20 or a 14 megahertz

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.690 
Wi-Fi that's a 20 or a 14 megahertz
channels

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
channels

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.310 
channels
you<00:07:06.700> really<00:07:07.180> found<00:07:07.420> that<00:07:07.630> valuable<00:07:07.960> because<00:07:08.290> a

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
you really found that valuable because a

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.810 
you really found that valuable because a
lot<00:07:08.650> of<00:07:08.740> people<00:07:08.980> really<00:07:09.130> get<00:07:09.340> confused

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
lot of people really get confused

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.570 
lot of people really get confused
between<00:07:10.000> what's<00:07:10.960> a<00:07:11.080> channel<00:07:11.470> band<00:07:11.710> and<00:07:12.130> what's

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
between what's a channel band and what's

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.340 
between what's a channel band and what's
the<00:07:12.730> frequency<00:07:13.030> band<00:07:13.510> and<00:07:13.930> what<00:07:14.110> does<00:07:14.230> all

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
the frequency band and what does all

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.680 
the frequency band and what does all
that<00:07:14.380> mean<00:07:14.560> so<00:07:15.280> play<00:07:15.610> with<00:07:15.640> this<00:07:16.030> take<00:07:16.390> a<00:07:16.420> look

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
that mean so play with this take a look

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.780 
that mean so play with this take a look
what's<00:07:16.900> happening<00:07:17.230> on<00:07:17.320> the<00:07:17.440> band<00:07:17.680> you<00:07:18.550> can

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.790 
what's happening on the band you can

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.760 
what's happening on the band you can
take<00:07:19.090> your<00:07:19.420> tool<00:07:19.750> you're<00:07:19.930> a<00:07:19.960> wireless<00:07:20.320> adapter

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
take your tool you're a wireless adapter

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.370 
take your tool you're a wireless adapter
in<00:07:20.980> the<00:07:21.130> laptop<00:07:21.340> and<00:07:21.790> walk<00:07:22.510> closer<00:07:22.960> to<00:07:23.290> the

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
in the laptop and walk closer to the

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.750 
in the laptop and walk closer to the
source<00:07:23.560> of<00:07:23.800> interference<00:07:24.040> you're<00:07:24.550> going<00:07:24.700> to

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760 
source of interference you're going to

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.610 
source of interference you're going to
find<00:07:24.970> those<00:07:25.150> signals<00:07:25.570> will<00:07:25.720> get<00:07:25.840> stronger<00:07:26.140> as

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
find those signals will get stronger as

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.310 
find those signals will get stronger as
you<00:07:26.920> move<00:07:27.250> away<00:07:27.370> they<00:07:27.760> get<00:07:27.970> weaker<00:07:28.420> so<00:07:28.900> play

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
you move away they get weaker so play

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.230 
you move away they get weaker so play
with<00:07:29.350> these<00:07:29.860> tools<00:07:30.220> and<00:07:30.610> again<00:07:31.090> I'm<00:07:31.210> not

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 
with these tools and again I'm not

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.620 
with these tools and again I'm not
recommending<00:07:31.690> channel<00:07:32.650> Iser<00:07:32.830> and<00:07:33.340> the<00:07:34.090> Y<00:07:34.240> spy
