favorite character is white I think at

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
favorite character is white I think at
least<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> beginning<00:01:41.640> he<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:42.750> have

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
least so in the beginning he did have

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
least so in the beginning he did have
good<00:01:43.259> intentions<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> do

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
good intentions because when you do

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
good intentions because when you do
think<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.049> weren't<00:01:46.259> super

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
think about it if there weren't super

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
think about it if there weren't super
super<00:01:47.130> EXTREME<00:01:47.460> criminals<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.210> talking

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
super EXTREME criminals and I'm talking

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
super EXTREME criminals and I'm talking
like<00:01:48.540> mass<00:01:48.960> murderers<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like mass murderers and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.530 
like mass murderers and
what<00:01:50.979> if<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.189> world<00:01:51.369> be<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.610> better<00:01:51.700> place<00:01:51.939> now

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
what if the world be a better place now

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.120 
what if the world be a better place now
I<00:01:52.810> know<00:01:52.869> he<00:01:53.079> did<00:01:53.259> kind<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.500> take<00:01:53.649> that<00:01:53.710> idea<00:01:54.070> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
I know he did kind of take that idea a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.219 
I know he did kind of take that idea a
bit<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.399> of<00:01:54.520> hands<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.030> even<00:01:55.149> also<00:01:55.810> kill<00:01:55.990> some

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
bit out of hands and even also kill some

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.800 
bit out of hands and even also kill some
innocent<00:01:56.890> people<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.390> thing<00:01:58.539> is<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.750> think

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
innocent people but the thing is I think

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.749 
innocent people but the thing is I think
he<00:01:59.079> also<00:01:59.229> kind<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.649> saw<00:01:59.920> them<00:02:00.159> it's<00:02:00.399> evil

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
he also kind of saw them it's evil

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.760 
he also kind of saw them it's evil
because<00:02:01.420> if<00:02:01.720> they're<00:02:01.899> standing<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.619> way

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
because if they're standing in the way

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.090 
because if they're standing in the way
of<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.700> god<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.149> new<00:02:04.299> world<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:05.409> they

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
of the god of the new world then they

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.779 
of the god of the new world then they
are<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.090> sense<00:02:07.299> opposing<00:02:08.050> him<00:02:08.619> his<00:02:09.280> ideas

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
are in a sense opposing him his ideas

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.900 
are in a sense opposing him his ideas
and<00:02:10.380> stopping<00:02:11.380> good<00:02:12.010> from<00:02:12.310> happening<00:02:12.730> because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
and stopping good from happening because

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.550 
and stopping good from happening because
they're<00:02:13.540> trying<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.750> keep<00:02:13.959> evil<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.380> world

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
they're trying to keep evil in the world

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.979 
they're trying to keep evil in the world
so<00:02:14.860> since<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:15.550> opposed<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.090> God<00:02:16.209> he<00:02:16.780> sees

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
so since they opposed to God he sees

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.110 
so since they opposed to God he sees
them<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> essentially<00:02:18.069> being<00:02:18.340> evil<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.060> I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
them is essentially being evil and I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.729 
them is essentially being evil and I
know<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.510> not<00:02:19.630> exactly<00:02:19.780> probably<00:02:20.319> proper

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
know it's not exactly probably proper

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.860 
know it's not exactly probably proper
thinking<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.790> can't<00:02:22.030> deny<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.390> light

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
thinking but you can't deny that light

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.850 
thinking but you can't deny that light
