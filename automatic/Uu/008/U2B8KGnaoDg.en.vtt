00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
hey what's up guys today I'm going to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey what's up guys today I'm going to
look<00:00:01.680> at<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.040> jawbone<00:00:02.700> up24<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.410> jawbone

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
look at the jawbone up24 and the jawbone

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.099 
look at the jawbone up24 and the jawbone
up<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.730> just<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.029> compare<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> two<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
up I'm just going to compare the two and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.870 
up I'm just going to compare the two and
kind<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.560> give<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.950> tell<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> difference

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
kind of give you tell the difference

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.450 
kind of give you tell the difference
between<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.780> two<00:00:09.960> first<00:00:10.860> off<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> very

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
between the two first off the very

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.009 
between the two first off the very
similar<00:00:11.940> they're<00:00:12.240> made<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> same

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
similar they're made of like the same

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
similar they're made of like the same
materials<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.340> only<00:00:14.519> way<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.790> really

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
materials the only way you can really

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630 
materials the only way you can really
tell<00:00:15.210> them<00:00:15.389> apart<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.260> their<00:00:16.619> design<00:00:17.220> for

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
tell them apart is by their design for

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.140 
tell them apart is by their design for
one<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.109> up24<00:00:19.380> kind<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.070> has<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> wavy<00:00:20.850> type

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
one the up24 kind of has a wavy type

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.410 
one the up24 kind of has a wavy type
front<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.109> where<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.060> second

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
front to it where the the up second

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
front to it where the the up second
generation<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.680> V's<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
generation has like the V's or the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.120 
generation has like the V's or the
double<00:00:26.939> use<00:00:27.119> zigzag<00:00:28.109> lines<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
double use zigzag lines going up and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.209 
double use zigzag lines going up and
down<00:00:29.390> also<00:00:30.560> another<00:00:31.560> way<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:31.980> tell<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
down also another way you can tell a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
down also another way you can tell a
difference<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> pop<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
difference is because if you pop off the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.830 
difference is because if you pop off the
caps<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> new<00:00:37.770> jawbone<00:00:38.309> up24

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
caps then the the new jawbone up24

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.970 
caps then the the new jawbone up24
actually<00:00:39.840> syncs<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.410> phone<00:00:40.680> via

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
actually syncs to your phone via

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.020 
actually syncs to your phone via
bluetooth<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.660> shrunk<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:44.030> cable

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
bluetooth so they have shrunk that cable

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
bluetooth so they have shrunk that cable
there<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> 2.5<00:00:46.170> millimeter<00:00:46.649> we're<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there to a 2.5 millimeter we're on the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.660 
there to a 2.5 millimeter we're on the
up<00:00:48.110> second<00:00:49.110> generation<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.520> actually

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
up second generation and would actually

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
up second generation and would actually
plug<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.420> phone<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> 3.5

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
plug into your phone so it's a 3.5

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.670 
plug into your phone so it's a 3.5
millimeter<00:00:53.449> on<00:00:54.449> besides<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> put

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
millimeter on besides that when I put

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.029 
millimeter on besides that when I put
them<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.460> buy<00:00:56.820> these<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> size<00:00:57.660> large

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
them on I buy these are the size large

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.240 
them on I buy these are the size large
the<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.309> 24<00:01:00.090> seems<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.590> bigger<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the up 24 seems to be a bit bigger and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
the up 24 seems to be a bit bigger and
when<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> put<00:01:02.699> them<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:02.940> I've<00:01:03.449> had<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.780> up

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
when I put them down I've had my up

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.679 
when I put them down I've had my up
second-generation<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> while<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.510> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
second-generation for a while now the up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
second-generation for a while now the up
24<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> still<00:01:07.740> slightly<00:01:08.490> bigger<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.119> not

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
24 is still slightly bigger so I'm not

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.840 
24 is still slightly bigger so I'm not
sure<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.049> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.100> raise<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
sure if they just kind of raise the up

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
sure if they just kind of raise the up
size<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.290> started<00:01:13.590> making<00:01:13.860> bigger<00:01:14.070> ones

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
size or just started making bigger ones

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.530 
size or just started making bigger ones
but<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.330> feel<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
but I also feel that the like around the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
but I also feel that the like around the
edge<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.140> feels<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.950> thinner<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
edge just feels like it's thinner on the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.690 
edge just feels like it's thinner on the
back<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.080> can't<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.560> tell<00:01:22.920> even<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
back you can't really tell even when you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
back you can't really tell even when you
hold<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.150> against<00:01:24.570> each<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
hold them up against each other but it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
hold them up against each other but it
just<00:01:25.560> feels<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.580> because

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
just feels I don't know if it's because

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
just feels I don't know if it's because
I<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> permissions<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> orange

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
I have the permissions or the orange

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
I have the permissions or the orange
color<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.790> feels<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
color but it just feels like it's a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
color but it just feels like it's a
little<00:01:30.810> thinner<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.189> biggest<00:01:32.400> difference

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
little thinner so the biggest difference

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
little thinner so the biggest difference
between<00:01:33.329> these<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.840> bands<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.100> 24

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
between these two bands are is the up 24

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.080 
between these two bands are is the up 24
sinks<00:01:36.270> over<00:01:36.560> bluetooth<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.070> 24<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> only

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
sinks over bluetooth the up 24 is only

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.130 
sinks over bluetooth the up 24 is only
compatible<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:41.040> iOS<00:01:41.549> devices

battery<00:02:02.700> life<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.509> gone<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.649> 24

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
battery life has gone down for the up 24

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.119 
battery life has gone down for the up 24
the<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.399> 24<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.869> expect<00:02:07.380> about<00:02:07.530> seven

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the up 24 you can expect about seven

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.880 
the up 24 you can expect about seven
days<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.580> battery<00:02:08.789> life<00:02:09.119> where<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.470> second

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
days of battery life where the up second

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.530 
days of battery life where the up second
generation<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.610> expect

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
generation you can expect

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.789 
generation you can expect
and<00:02:12.659> days<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.079> battery<00:02:13.349> life<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.709> that

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
and days of battery life and that

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.350 
and days of battery life and that
probably<00:02:14.099> has<00:02:14.159> something<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
probably has something to do with the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.199 
probably has something to do with the
Bluetooth<00:02:15.780> syncing<00:02:16.519> so<00:02:17.519> that's<00:02:17.879> about<00:02:18.030> it

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
Bluetooth syncing so that's about it

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.429 
Bluetooth syncing so that's about it
those<00:02:18.629> are<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> biggest<00:02:19.079> differences

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
those are the biggest differences

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.069 
those are the biggest differences
between<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.730> second<00:02:21.120> generation<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
between the up second generation and the

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.069 
between the up second generation and the
up<00:02:22.230> 24<00:02:22.799> I'll<00:02:23.489> go<00:02:23.670> ahead<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> put<00:02:24.239> my<00:02:24.269> reviews
