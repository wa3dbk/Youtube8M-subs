00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
started my cut on the fifth of july and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.120 
started my cut on the fifth of july and
it's<00:00:26.189> been<00:00:26.489> a<00:00:26.849> week<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.450> half<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.829> so<00:00:29.009> i'm

it's been a week and a half and so i'm

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.400 
it's been a week and a half and so i'm
taking<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.520> average<00:00:29.669> of<00:00:30.059> every<00:00:30.180> week<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
taking the average of every week and of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.369 
taking the average of every week and of
my<00:00:31.649> weight<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> average<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
my weight and then take the average of

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:35.779 
my weight and then take the average of
the<00:00:34.469> fault<00:00:34.649> i<00:00:34.739> take<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> average<00:00:35.190> every<00:00:35.609> week

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
the fault i take the average every week

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.910 
the fault i take the average every week
and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.179> compare<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.589> weight

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and then compare and see how much weight

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.139 
and then compare and see how much weight
that<00:00:37.949> I've<00:00:38.250> lost<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> between<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.640> first<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that I've lost so between my first and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.049 
that I've lost so between my first and
second<00:00:42.719> week<00:00:42.929> I<00:00:43.260> lost<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.309> whole<00:00:44.429> pound<00:00:44.670> which

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
second week I lost a whole pound which

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.939 
second week I lost a whole pound which
is<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.510> than<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.929> to<00:00:46.019> lose<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.679> feel

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
is more than I want to lose but I feel

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.829 
is more than I want to lose but I feel
like<00:00:46.999> maybe<00:00:47.999> it's<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.269> doing<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.780> because

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
like maybe it's just doing that because

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.509 
like maybe it's just doing that because
my<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.499> like<00:00:49.649> whoa<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.010> happened<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
my body is like whoa what happened and

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.910 
my body is like whoa what happened and
then<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.409> couple<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then I also have like I have a couple of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.739 
then I also have like I have a couple of
sessions<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:53.969> cardio<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
sessions of some really good cardio in

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.299 
sessions of some really good cardio in
there<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> hadn't<00:00:55.649> been<00:00:55.739> doing<00:00:55.980> cardio

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there which I hadn't been doing cardio

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.349 
there which I hadn't been doing cardio
so<00:00:56.640> um<00:00:57.920> technically<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.609> think<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.089> in<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so um technically I don't think I'm in a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.950 
so um technically I don't think I'm in a
deficit<00:01:00.979> a<00:01:01.979> caloric<00:01:02.579> deficit<00:01:02.999> with<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
deficit a caloric deficit with the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.740 
deficit a caloric deficit with the
calculations<00:01:04.800> I<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.480> used<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
calculations I did I used to do the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
calculations I did I used to do the
Harris<00:01:09.750> Benedict<00:01:10.260> equation<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> find<00:01:11.040> out

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Harris Benedict equation to find out

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
Harris Benedict equation to find out
like<00:01:11.550> my<00:01:11.760> BMR<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.480> then<00:01:12.570> calculate<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.200> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
like my BMR and then calculate in my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
like my BMR and then calculate in my
activity<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.730> figure<00:01:14.940> out<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.420> my

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
activity to figure out how much my

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
activity to figure out how much my
maintenance<00:01:15.810> calories<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
maintenance calories would be but that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.990 
maintenance calories would be but that
works<00:01:18.240> better<00:01:18.480> for<00:01:18.690> obese<00:01:18.990> people<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.610> feel

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
works better for obese people and I feel

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.750 
works better for obese people and I feel
like<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.180> pretty<00:01:21.360> lean<00:01:22.130> maybe<00:01:23.130> less<00:01:23.370> than<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
like I'm pretty lean maybe less than the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.170 
like I'm pretty lean maybe less than the
average<00:01:24.030> person<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.870> I<00:01:25.400> used<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> mifflin

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
average person but I used the mifflin

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.500 
average person but I used the mifflin
calculation<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.430> fits<00:01:29.580> your<00:01:29.730> macros<00:01:29.850> i

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
calculation on if it fits your macros i

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.410 
calculation on if it fits your macros i
just<00:01:30.780> plugged<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.140> numbers<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:32.820> said<00:01:33.090> at

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
just plugged my numbers in they said at

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.730 
just plugged my numbers in they said at
123<00:01:34.170> pounds<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:35.720> my<00:01:36.720> average<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.620> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
123 pounds my my average like the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.810 
123 pounds my my average like the
calories<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.190> supposed<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:38.700> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
calories that are supposed to take in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
calories that are supposed to take in
every<00:01:39.030> day<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.540> tdee<00:01:40.050> total<00:01:40.830> daily<00:01:41.250> energy

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
every day the tdee total daily energy

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.690 
every day the tdee total daily energy
expenditure<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:43.980> something<00:01:44.550> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
expenditure I don't know something like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.750 
expenditure I don't know something like
that<00:01:44.940> um<00:01:45.860> was<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:48.080> 2234<00:01:49.080> calories<00:01:49.650> my<00:01:50.550> average

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
that um was is 2234 calories my average

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.080 
that um was is 2234 calories my average
for<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.330> week<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:52.310> 2408<00:01:53.310> calories<00:01:53.760> because

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
for that week was 2408 calories because

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 
for that week was 2408 calories because
I<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.540> bad<00:01:54.750> cheat<00:01:55.050> day<00:01:55.410> so<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.800> took

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
I had a pretty bad cheat day so I took

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.890 
I had a pretty bad cheat day so I took
the<00:01:56.100> average<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.580> like<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.240> added<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.750> my

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
the average of like I added up all my

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.050 
the average of like I added up all my
calories<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> whole<00:01:58.680> week<00:01:58.940> divided<00:01:59.940> up

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
calories for the whole week divided up

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
calories for the whole week divided up
by<00:02:00.180> seven<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.660> took<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:00.990> average<00:02:01.260> for<00:02:01.410> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
because i haven't been super strict but

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.040 
because i haven't been super strict but
i'm<00:02:07.620> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.980> get<00:02:08.099> stricter<00:02:08.369> i<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.509> changed

that I'll just show you on my calendar
and<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.230> slowly<00:02:16.379> reducing<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:17.040> every

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and I was slowly reducing them every

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.009 
and I was slowly reducing them every
four<00:02:17.610> days<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.269> then<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> kind<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.690> slowed<00:02:18.900> it

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
four days and then I kind of slowed it

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.199 
four days and then I kind of slowed it
down<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.230> decided<00:02:19.769> oh<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.250> maybe<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.819> just

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
down and decided oh well maybe I just

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.430 
down and decided oh well maybe I just
want<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> leave<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.720> where<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.170> with

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
want to leave it where it's at with

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.490 
want to leave it where it's at with
traveling<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.340> stuff<00:02:23.580> um<00:02:23.989> since<00:02:24.989> i'm<00:02:25.140> moving

on friday but then i was like oh no i'm
probably<00:02:27.810> gonna<00:02:27.989> end<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.260> cheating<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
probably gonna end up cheating and

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.039 
probably gonna end up cheating and
eating<00:02:29.069> too<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.310> fat<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.970> whatever<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
eating too much fat and whatever so I

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.649 
eating too much fat and whatever so I
reduce<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:31.620> fat<00:02:32.010> by<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.430> five<00:02:32.579> grams<00:02:32.909> from

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
reduce my fat by just five grams from

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.729 
reduce my fat by just five grams from
6255<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.069> then<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:36.209> carbs<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:36.840> below<00:02:37.170> 300

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
6255 and then my carbs are now below 300

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.180 
6255 and then my carbs are now below 300
grams<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.250> 295<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.269> my<00:02:39.659> protein<00:02:40.079> remains<00:02:40.409> 125

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
grams so 295 and my protein remains 125

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.880 
grams so 295 and my protein remains 125
I<00:02:41.810> decided<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.989> reduce<00:02:43.109> my<00:02:43.349> carbs<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.680> little

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
I decided to reduce my carbs a little

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.470 
I decided to reduce my carbs a little
bit<00:02:44.010> even<00:02:44.250> though<00:02:44.280> I'm<00:02:44.549> still<00:02:45.000> losing<00:02:45.269> weight

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
bit even though I'm still losing weight

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.119 
bit even though I'm still losing weight
because<00:02:46.109> I'm<00:02:46.319> seeing<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> little<00:02:46.769> bit<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.040> a

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
because I'm seeing a little bit of a

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.930 
because I'm seeing a little bit of a
standstill<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.970> week<00:02:48.650> 120<00:02:49.650> 2.6<00:02:50.190> pounds<00:02:50.250> 120

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
down this in my phone and so I'm kind of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.860 
down this in my phone and so I'm kind of
seeing<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.730> little<00:02:59.849> bit<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> standstill<00:03:00.569> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
seeing a little bit of a standstill so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.119 
seeing a little bit of a standstill so
I'm<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.049> okay<00:03:01.230> well<00:03:01.500> maybe<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.739> should<00:03:01.950> reduce

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
I'm like okay well maybe I should reduce

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.160 
I'm like okay well maybe I should reduce
my<00:03:02.340> carbs<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.700> little<00:03:02.909> bit<00:03:03.030> plus<00:03:03.299> i<00:03:03.540> imagine

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
my carbs a little bit plus i imagine

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.479 
my carbs a little bit plus i imagine
that<00:03:04.200> i'll<00:03:04.349> be<00:03:04.379> cheating<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.859> little<00:03:04.890> bit<00:03:05.220> more

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that i'll be cheating a little bit more

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.599 
that i'll be cheating a little bit more
over<00:03:06.420> travels<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.980> eating<00:03:08.220> out<00:03:08.310> with<00:03:08.430> family

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
over travels just eating out with family

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.130 
over travels just eating out with family
and<00:03:08.879> everything<00:03:09.030> i'm<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.569> try<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and everything i'm going to try not to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.539 
and everything i'm going to try not to
i'm<00:03:10.379> going<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.560> try<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.709> fit<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.159> macros

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
i'm going to try and fit in my macros

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.910 
i'm going to try and fit in my macros
but<00:03:11.970> i'm<00:03:12.269> anticipating<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.739> won't

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
but i'm anticipating that it won't

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.860 
but i'm anticipating that it won't
always<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:15.060> i<00:03:15.359> want<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
always be like that so i want to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.500 
always be like that so i want to
compensate<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.919> that<00:03:16.950> by<00:03:17.099> having<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.329> lower

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
compensate for that by having a lower

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.720 
compensate for that by having a lower
caloric<00:03:19.049> intake<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> lower<00:03:19.859> carbohydrate

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
caloric intake and a lower carbohydrate

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.720 
caloric intake and a lower carbohydrate
intake<00:03:21.599> so<00:03:22.290> i<00:03:22.319> will<00:03:22.680> show<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:22.889> what<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:23.280> keep

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
intake so i will show you what I'm keep

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.050 
intake so i will show you what I'm keep
