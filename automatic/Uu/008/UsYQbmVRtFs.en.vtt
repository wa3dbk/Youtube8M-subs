run<00:02:43.290> through<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.800> dribble<00:02:44.100> through<00:02:44.220> them<00:02:44.370> or

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
run through and dribble through them or

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
run through and dribble through them or
go<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> tactic<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.930> showed<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
go for the tactic that i showed in the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.190 
go for the tactic that i showed in the
previous<00:02:46.500> em<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.210> previous<00:02:48.660> video<00:02:48.840> where

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
previous em in the previous video where

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.750 
previous em in the previous video where
what<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.920> between<00:02:50.340> each<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.670> those

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
what you do is in between each of those

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.400 
what you do is in between each of those
like<00:02:51.000> lanes<00:02:51.360> i<00:02:51.630> want<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> say<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.050> just<00:02:52.290> hold

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
like lanes i want to say you just hold

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.350 
like lanes i want to say you just hold
lb<00:02:52.830> which<00:02:53.040> stops<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.240> go

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
lb which stops it and then you can go

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
lb which stops it and then you can go
forward<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.810> little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.590> kind<00:02:55.890> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
forward a little bit and i kind of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.170 
forward a little bit and i kind of
figured<00:02:56.070> that's<00:02:56.370> probably<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.760> best<00:02:56.910> way<00:02:57.060> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
figured that's probably the best way to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.760 
figured that's probably the best way to
do<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> must<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:58.080> very<00:02:58.440> time-consuming

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
do it must just be very time-consuming

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.550 
do it must just be very time-consuming
and<00:02:59.370> slightly<00:02:59.880> boring<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:00.840> i<00:03:00.870> suppose<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> is

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and slightly boring but i suppose it is

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080 
and slightly boring but i suppose it is
the<00:03:01.740> best<00:03:01.890> way<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> do<00:03:02.340> things<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.910> hard

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the best way to do things but the hard

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.180 
the best way to do things but the hard
bit<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.780> isn't<00:03:04.350> necessarily<00:03:04.830> getting

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
bit of this is isn't necessarily getting

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.850 
bit of this is isn't necessarily getting
through<00:03:05.640> these<00:03:05.850> yellow<00:03:06.360> brick<00:03:07.140> walls<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.710> your

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
through these yellow brick walls in your

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.980 
through these yellow brick walls in your
way<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.250> actually<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.360> ending<00:03:09.750> where<00:03:09.900> you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
way it's actually the ending where you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.780 
way it's actually the ending where you
have<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> shoot<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.710> try<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:10.980> score<00:03:11.340> that's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
have to shoot and try and score that's

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.890 
have to shoot and try and score that's
the<00:03:11.940> bit<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> i<00:03:12.240> found<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> most

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the bit that i found the most

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.450 
the bit that i found the most
challenging<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.070> see<00:03:14.190> here<00:03:14.370> i'm<00:03:14.430> just

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
challenging as you can see here i'm just

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000 
challenging as you can see here i'm just
storming<00:03:15.030> down<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.420> left<00:03:15.720> wing<00:03:15.990> cuts<00:03:16.470> inside

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
storming down this left wing cuts inside

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.000 
storming down this left wing cuts inside
move<00:03:17.730> always<00:03:18.120> absolutely<00:03:18.900> done<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.680> man<00:03:19.830> in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
move always absolutely done the man in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.310 
move always absolutely done the man in
yellow<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.460> he's<00:03:20.820> shot<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:22.050> actually

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
yellow and he's shot and I do actually

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.200 
yellow and he's shot and I do actually
end<00:03:22.770> up<00:03:22.890> getting<00:03:23.190> through<00:03:23.460> past<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.910> silver

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
end up getting through past the silver

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.240 
end up getting through past the silver
level<00:03:24.390> which<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.720> nice<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
level which was nice to see and on to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.500 
level which was nice to see and on to
the<00:03:26.280> gold<00:03:26.610> level<00:03:26.760> now<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.120> one's<00:03:27.360> pretty

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
me a little while to fully understand

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.380 
me a little while to fully understand
what<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.330> wanted<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:41.340> best<00:03:41.550> way<00:03:41.820> to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
kind of complete this particular level

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.940 
kind of complete this particular level
is<00:03:44.280> by<00:03:44.790> abusing<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.690> scoop<00:03:46.050> turn<00:03:46.290> i<00:03:46.500> means<00:03:46.890> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
is by abusing the scoop turn i means you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.080 
is by abusing the scoop turn i means you
guys<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.340> how<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.520> do<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.730> scoop<00:03:47.910> turn

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
guys don't know how to do the scoop turn

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.670 
guys don't know how to do the scoop turn
you<00:03:48.240> cannot<00:03:48.510> almost<00:03:48.900> have<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.080> be<00:03:49.230> stationary

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you cannot almost have to be stationary

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.200 
you cannot almost have to be stationary
a<00:03:49.830> lot<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.250> time<00:03:50.370> especially<00:03:50.490> on<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.000> one

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
a lot of the time especially on this one

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.150 
a lot of the time especially on this one
gonna<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.720> stationary<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.410> then<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.830> just<00:03:53.010> do

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
gonna be stationary and then you just do

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.120 
gonna be stationary and then you just do
the<00:03:53.280> fake<00:03:53.520> shot<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.600> put<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.530> direction

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the fake shot and you put the direction

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.280 
the fake shot and you put the direction
it<00:03:56.610> kind<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:56.910> behind<00:03:57.240> you<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.780> does<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> 180

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
it kind of behind you so it does a 180

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.560 
it kind of behind you so it does a 180
scoop<00:03:59.160> turn<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> works<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.150> actually

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
scoop turn and it works out actually

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.360 
scoop turn and it works out actually
pretty<00:04:00.780> well<00:04:01.050> so<00:04:01.260> I'm<00:04:01.590> iris<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.920> get<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.130> first

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
pretty well so I'm iris to get the first

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.850 
pretty well so I'm iris to get the first
two<00:04:02.610> done<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:04.080> just<00:04:04.290> really<00:04:04.470> hard<00:04:04.560> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
two done and it was just really hard the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.680 
two done and it was just really hard the
defenders<00:04:05.280> go<00:04:05.460> all<00:04:05.760> out<00:04:05.790> for<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.210> as<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.570> can

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
went completely wrong anyways um I try

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.730 
went completely wrong anyways um I try
to<00:04:32.090> move<00:04:32.270> inside<00:04:32.660> there<00:04:32.930> for<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.200> little<00:04:33.350> bit<00:04:33.470> of

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
to move inside there for a little bit of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.590 
to move inside there for a little bit of
a<00:04:33.890> I<00:04:34.310> think<00:04:34.730> it's<00:04:34.820> called<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.060> stop<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.450> turn

here<00:05:23.450> take<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.260> there<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:26.150> was<00:05:26.300> my<00:05:26.420> final

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
here take it there and this was my final

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.030 
here take it there and this was my final
attempt<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.140> i<00:05:27.200> had<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.440> make<00:05:27.590> something<00:05:27.800> good

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
attempt so i had to make something good

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.860 
attempt so i had to make something good
of<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.250> but<00:05:28.730> i<00:05:29.000> managed<00:05:29.390> to<00:05:29.450> get<00:05:29.600> into<00:05:29.780> the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
of it but i managed to get into the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.210 
of it but i managed to get into the
green<00:05:30.140> zone<00:05:30.410> as<00:05:30.590> well<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:30.860> that's<00:05:30.950> when<00:05:31.130> you

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
this next one was a little bit a weird I

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.820 
this next one was a little bit a weird I
don't<00:05:53.660> fully<00:05:53.870> understand<00:05:54.320> what<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.620> crack

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
don't fully understand what the crack

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.130 
don't fully understand what the crack
was<00:05:55.010> but<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.250> actually<00:05:55.430> had<00:05:55.790> to<00:05:56.000> do<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> skill

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
was but you actually had to do a skill

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.110 
was but you actually had to do a skill
move<00:05:57.380> around<00:05:57.860> this<00:05:58.100> bit<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.730> guess<00:05:58.970> the

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
move around this bit and I guess the

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.030 
move around this bit and I guess the
easiest<00:05:59.270> one<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.720> do<00:05:59.930> was<00:06:00.110> a<00:06:00.140> roulette<00:06:00.530> but

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
easiest one to do was a roulette but

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.920 
easiest one to do was a roulette but
sometimes<00:06:01.550> it<00:06:01.730> didn't<00:06:02.030> actually<00:06:02.180> work<00:06:02.660> which

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
sometimes it didn't actually work which

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.350 
sometimes it didn't actually work which
is<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> little<00:06:03.350> bit<00:06:03.500> weird<00:06:03.770> now<00:06:04.120> excuse<00:06:05.120> me<00:06:05.300> I

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
is a little bit weird now excuse me I

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.180 
is a little bit weird now excuse me I
really<00:06:05.750> shouldn't<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.140> Bert<00:06:06.260> there<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:06.650> hey

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
really shouldn't have Bert there but hey

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.580 
really shouldn't have Bert there but hey
oh<00:06:07.220> yeah<00:06:08.060> so<00:06:08.300> we<00:06:08.780> have<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.080> do<00:06:09.170> is<00:06:09.260> you<00:06:09.410> either

oh yeah so we have to do is you either
roulette<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.250> think<00:06:10.490> someone<00:06:10.880> also<00:06:11.030> did<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
roulette I think someone also did the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.350 
roulette I think someone also did the
step-over<00:06:12.530> exit<00:06:13.250> where<00:06:13.430> you<00:06:13.550> kind<00:06:13.790> of<00:06:13.850> just<00:06:14.270> do

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
step-over exit where you kind of just do

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.550 
step-over exit where you kind of just do
a<00:06:14.390> step<00:06:14.600> over<00:06:14.780> and<00:06:14.900> then<00:06:14.990> you<00:06:15.050> push<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.320> ball

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
a step over and then you push the ball

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.710 
a step over and then you push the ball
off<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.830> one<00:06:16.070> side<00:06:16.100> so<00:06:16.880> what<00:06:17.120> you<00:06:17.210> can<00:06:17.330> also<00:06:17.450> do

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
off to one side so what you can also do

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.060 
off to one side so what you can also do
that<00:06:17.900> to<00:06:18.050> get<00:06:18.200> around<00:06:18.350> that<00:06:18.500> particular<00:06:18.680> bit

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
that to get around that particular bit

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.560 
that to get around that particular bit
but<00:06:19.430> this<00:06:19.550> book<00:06:19.700> this<00:06:19.940> bit<00:06:20.150> was<00:06:20.270> actually

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
but this book this bit was actually

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.330 
but this book this bit was actually
really<00:06:20.690> hard<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:21.170> you<00:06:21.410> might<00:06:21.590> think<00:06:21.620> Cal<00:06:22.010> Cal

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
really hard and you might think Cal Cal

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.070 
really hard and you might think Cal Cal
you<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:22.880> so<00:06:23.030> bad<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.300> decide<00:06:23.600> why<00:06:23.750> can't<00:06:24.020> you

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
you just so bad to decide why can't you

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.020 
you just so bad to decide why can't you
do<00:06:24.200> it<00:06:24.230> so<00:06:24.410> easily<00:06:24.440> it<00:06:25.010> was<00:06:25.340> actually<00:06:25.730> a<00:06:25.760> little

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
do it so easily it was actually a little

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.850 
do it so easily it was actually a little
bit<00:06:26.270> of<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:26.510> bug<00:06:26.690> in<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:26.960> game<00:06:27.140> well<00:06:27.500> not<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.650> bug

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
bit of a bug in the game well not a bug

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.010 
bit of a bug in the game well not a bug
in<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.100> game<00:06:28.250> but<00:06:28.490> it<00:06:28.910> was<00:06:29.120> really<00:06:29.720> hard<00:06:29.930> to

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
in the game but it was really hard to

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.770 
in the game but it was really hard to
pull<00:06:30.290> off<00:06:30.440> skill<00:06:30.770> moves<00:06:31.010> in<00:06:31.220> this<00:06:31.370> particular
