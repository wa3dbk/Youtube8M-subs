00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.899 

hi<00:00:00.599> again<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> figured<00:00:02.340> out<00:00:02.429> what<00:00:02.700> was

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hi again guys so I figured out what was

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi again guys so I figured out what was
the<00:00:03.120> problem<00:00:03.149> so<00:00:03.780> last<00:00:04.529> time<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.770> wanted<00:00:05.069> to

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
the problem so last time I wanted to

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.839 
the problem so last time I wanted to
draw<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:06.710> let<00:00:07.710> me<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.309> want<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.639> draw

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
draw the let me show you I want to draw

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.540 
draw the let me show you I want to draw
so<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> polygons<00:00:09.929> were<00:00:10.170> ahead<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.740> figured

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
so all the polygons were ahead I figured

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.759 
so all the polygons were ahead I figured
out<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:11.880> was<00:00:12.030> wrong<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> code<00:00:12.870> so

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
out what was wrong with the code so

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.760 
out what was wrong with the code so
let's<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.490> get<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.910> when<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:16.170> setting

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
let's just get to it when I was setting

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.939 
let's just get to it when I was setting
this<00:00:16.890> equal<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.670> calculate<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> T

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
this equal to this calculate the T

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.410 
this equal to this calculate the T
figure<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> calculator<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> T<00:00:21.060> value

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
figure out the calculator the T value

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.330 
figure out the calculator the T value
that<00:00:21.990> wasn't<00:00:22.350> actually<00:00:22.619> how<00:00:22.740> far<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.279> from

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that wasn't actually how far it was from

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.500 
that wasn't actually how far it was from
the<00:00:24.560> from<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> dat<00:00:26.400> camera<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.090> where<00:00:27.330> we're

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the from the dat camera or where we're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
the from the dat camera or where we're
looking<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:28.769> far<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> rest<00:00:29.220> they

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
looking from was how far the rest they

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.030 
looking from was how far the rest they
were<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.140> plane<00:00:31.410> we're<00:00:31.679> looking<00:00:31.920> at

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
were actually the plane we're looking at

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
were actually the plane we're looking at
so<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.940> didn't<00:00:33.270> actually<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> distance

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so that didn't actually get the distance

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.639 
so that didn't actually get the distance
to<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> point<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.600> gonna<00:00:36.809> calculate<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to the point so I'm gonna calculate the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
to the point so I'm gonna calculate the
distance<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.250> another<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:40.370> in<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
distance in another way and in this the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
distance in another way and in this the
polygon<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> make<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> new<00:00:45.500> method

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
polygon I'm going to make a new method

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.330 
polygon I'm going to make a new method
called

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
called

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
called
get<00:00:47.670> distance<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> I'm

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
get distance in this this in this I'm

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.619 
get distance in this this in this I'm
gonna<00:00:51.930> start<00:00:52.440> creating<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> total<00:00:53.910> double

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
gonna start creating the total double

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
gonna start creating the total double
total<00:00:55.050> equal<00:00:55.440> zero<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.969> run<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
total equal zero then I'm gonna run a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
total equal zero then I'm gonna run a
loop<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.770> run<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.250> each<00:00:59.340> pointers<00:01:00.030> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
loop it's gonna run for each pointers in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.860 
loop it's gonna run for each pointers in
the<00:01:00.390> polygon<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> smaller<00:01:03.030> than<00:01:03.420> extra

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the polygon so I is smaller than extra

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.899 
the polygon so I is smaller than extra
length<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:05.270> plot<00:01:06.270> loss<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.010> then<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.340> here

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
length I plot loss and then in here

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.920 
length I plot loss and then in here
we're<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.479> add<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> length<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
we're gonna add the length or the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.219 
we're gonna add the length or the
distance<00:01:14.000> from<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:17.540> what's<00:01:18.540> called<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
distance from the what's called from the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
distance from the what's called from the
view<00:01:19.710> point<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.520> point<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:23.580> we're

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
view point to the point that we're

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.719 
view point to the point that we're
trying<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> distance<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.159> plus

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
trying to get the distance to so plus

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:36.540 
trying to get the distance to so plus
equals<00:01:27.409> plus<00:01:28.579> total<00:01:29.579> plus<00:01:31.250> get<00:01:32.250> distance

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.190 

I'll<00:01:37.550> make<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:39.970> get<00:01:40.970> distance<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.510> pee<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:41.990> I'm

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
I'll make a get distance to pee and I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.530 
I'll make a get distance to pee and I'm
Gus<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.890> gonna<00:01:43.130> write<00:01:43.640> an<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.150> haven't

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
Gus just gonna write an I so I haven't

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.700 
Gus just gonna write an I so I haven't
made<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.810> function<00:01:48.170> yet<00:01:48.290> but<00:01:48.440> I'm<00:01:48.530> gonna

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
made this function yet but I'm gonna

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.230 
made this function yet but I'm gonna
make<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:48.980> right<00:01:49.070> now<00:01:49.510> boy<00:01:50.770> get<00:01:51.770> distance<00:01:52.520> to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
make it right now boy get distance to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:02.560 
make it right now boy get distance to
pee<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:55.300> then<00:02:00.730> it<00:02:01.730> is<00:02:01.880> actually<00:02:02.210> gonna<00:02:02.360> be<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
pee and then it is actually gonna be a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.440 
pee and then it is actually gonna be a
double<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.850> gonna<00:02:05.030> return<00:02:05.270> zero<00:02:05.600> for<00:02:05.870> now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.850 

and<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.630> grant<00:02:11.840> signal<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.290> G<00:02:12.440> Joe

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and this grant signal in G Joe

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.340 
and this grant signal in G Joe
so<00:02:13.820> what<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.180> function<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.110> is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
so what this function is going to do is

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.199 
so what this function is going to do is
get<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> distance<00:02:16.250> from<00:02:16.459> one<00:02:16.670> point<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
get the distance from one point to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.210 
get the distance from one point to
another<00:02:17.390> point<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.010> this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
another point and what this this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.250 
another point and what this this
function<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.240> scatter<00:02:21.080> all

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
function is going to do scatter all

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
function is going to do scatter all
those<00:02:21.470> distances<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.250> create<00:02:22.880> an<00:02:22.970> average<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
those distances and create an average of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.970 
those distances and create an average of
those<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.760> know<00:02:25.870> loop<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:27.080> once<00:02:27.740> we've

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
those so you know loop here once we've

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.610 
those so you know loop here once we've
added<00:02:28.459> all<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.090> distances<00:02:29.959> we're<00:02:30.170> gonna<00:02:30.320> say

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
added all the distances we're gonna say

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.380 
added all the distances we're gonna say
total<00:02:32.800> actually<00:02:33.800> gonna<00:02:33.920> make<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.390> double

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
total actually gonna make this a double

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.040 
total actually gonna make this a double
as<00:02:35.630> well<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.080> gonna<00:02:36.170> return<00:02:36.520> say<00:02:37.520> return

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
as well so it's gonna return say return

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.660 
as well so it's gonna return say return
total<00:02:39.050> divided<00:02:39.920> by<00:02:40.220> X<00:02:41.209> dot<00:02:41.480> length<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.519> get

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
total divided by X dot length so we get

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.120 
total divided by X dot length so we get
the<00:02:43.760> average<00:02:44.350> down<00:02:45.350> here<00:02:45.590> we're<00:02:45.769> going<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
the average down here we're going to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.440 
the average down here we're going to
calculate<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.640> distance<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.360> P<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.489> we

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
calculate the distance to P and so we

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.190 
calculate the distance to P and so we
are<00:02:50.630> going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:51.019> return<00:02:51.430> how<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.489> care<00:02:52.790> how<00:02:53.030> you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
are going to return how you care how you

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.729 
are going to return how you care how you
calculate<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.440> distance<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:56.530> 3d<00:02:57.530> is

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
calculate the distance in the 3d is

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.270 
calculate the distance in the 3d is
pretty<00:02:58.160> simple<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:58.489> text<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.360> x<00:02:59.630> value

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
pretty simple just text the x value

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.360 
pretty simple just text the x value
times<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.430> x<00:03:01.670> value<00:03:02.769> take<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.860> square<00:03:04.130> root

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
times the x value take the square root

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.420 
times the x value take the square root
of<00:03:04.610> all<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.290> plus<00:03:07.239> copy<00:03:08.239> this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
of all this plus copy this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.910 
of all this plus copy this
plus<00:03:11.560> 3y<00:03:13.060> times<00:03:14.060> y<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.720> these<00:03:14.870> C<00:03:15.200> times<00:03:15.590> 2<00:03:15.739> C

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
plus 3y times y and these C times 2 C

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.000 
plus 3y times y and these C times 2 C
square<00:03:16.420> root<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.540> all<00:03:17.629> that<00:03:17.690> then<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
square root of all that then you get the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.350 
square root of all that then you get the
distance<00:03:19.760> from<00:03:20.000> one<00:03:20.420> point<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.840> another

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.509 

actually<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.480> isn't<00:03:26.930> what<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.200> need<00:03:27.459> what<00:03:28.459> we

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
actually this isn't what we need what we

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.910 
actually this isn't what we need what we
need<00:03:28.670> was<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.180> distance<00:03:29.720> from<00:03:32.739> from<00:03:33.739> our

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
need was the distance from from our

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.250 
need was the distance from from our
viewpoint<00:03:34.280> where<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.239> ring<00:03:35.420> from<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:36.079> this

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
viewpoint where we ring from to this

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.770 
viewpoint where we ring from to this
right<00:03:37.159> now<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.730> distance<00:03:38.030> from<00:03:38.150> 0<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
right now we get the distance from 0 to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.930 
right now we get the distance from 0 to
this<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.769> instead<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.250> writing<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.579> we're

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
this so instead of writing this we're

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.020 
this so instead of writing this we're
gonna<00:03:41.120> write<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.890> view<00:03:43.390> from<00:03:44.390> gronckle<00:03:45.379> screen

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
gonna write a view from gronckle screen

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:56.670 
gonna write a view from gronckle screen
that<00:03:47.030> view<00:03:47.299> from<00:03:48.579> then<00:03:49.579> 0<00:03:49.879> minus<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:54.579> oops

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that view from then 0 minus this oops

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.130 
that view from then 0 minus this oops
minus<00:03:57.680> this

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
minus this

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.090 
minus this
it's<00:03:59.770> got<00:03:59.950> time<00:04:00.490> this<00:04:00.670> by<00:04:01.210> itself<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.690> squared

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
it's got time this by itself so squared

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.150 
it's got time this by itself so squared
okay<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.630> distance<00:04:08.080> between<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
okay so this is the distance between a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.530 
okay so this is the distance between a
view<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.430> our<00:04:12.640> X<00:04:13.210> or<00:04:14.020> Y<00:04:14.620> offset<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:15.190> whatever

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
view and our X or Y offset of whatever

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.849 
view and our X or Y offset of whatever
so<00:04:16.540> I'm<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:16.840> gonna<00:04:16.989> write<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:17.980> instead

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
so I'm just gonna write this instead

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:35.429 
so I'm just gonna write this instead
so<00:04:20.859> plus<00:04:24.360> plus<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:29.100> delete<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.250> again

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.249 

so<00:04:36.039> I'm<00:04:36.159> going<00:04:36.309> to<00:04:36.369> change<00:04:36.550> all<00:04:36.849> these<00:04:37.029> to<00:04:37.419> y<00:04:37.809> +

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
so I'm going to change all these to y +

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:44.729 
so I'm going to change all these to y +
2<00:04:38.289> 1<00:04:38.860> &amp;<00:04:39.249> 2<00:04:39.369> -<00:04:39.580> sorry<00:04:40.089> -<00:04:40.569> see<00:04:40.749> you<00:04:41.339> -<00:04:42.339> 1<00:04:42.669> 2<00:04:43.179> 2<00:04:43.389> +<00:04:43.689> 2<00:04:43.869> y

+<00:04:45.129> 2<00:04:45.159> C<00:04:46.649> so<00:04:47.649> if<00:04:47.919> I'm<00:04:48.039> not<00:04:48.159> wrong<00:04:48.369> we<00:04:48.580> now<00:04:48.699> have

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
+ 2 C so if I'm not wrong we now have

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.989 
+ 2 C so if I'm not wrong we now have
the<00:04:49.149> distance<00:04:49.809> from<00:04:50.459> view<00:04:51.459> from<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.999> our<00:04:52.239> X<00:04:53.999> so

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
the distance from view from to our X so

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.999 
the distance from view from to our X so
now<00:04:55.300> we<00:04:55.899> have<00:04:55.989> to<00:04:56.139> turn<00:04:56.349> this<00:04:56.529> we<00:04:56.709> need<00:04:56.860> to

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
now we have to turn this we need to

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.489 
now we have to turn this we need to
instead<00:04:57.399> of<00:04:57.629> doing<00:04:58.629> all<00:04:58.719> this<00:04:58.959> with<00:04:59.229> getting

00:04:59.489 --> 00:04:59.499 
instead of doing all this with getting

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.169 
instead of doing all this with getting
the<00:04:59.649> T<00:04:59.979> value<00:05:00.309> in<00:05:00.399> here<00:05:00.550> I'm<00:05:00.669> gonna<00:05:00.879> change

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:01.179 
the T value in here I'm gonna change

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:03.689 
the T value in here I'm gonna change
this<00:05:01.389> back<00:05:01.689> section<00:05:01.899> actually<00:05:02.559> delete<00:05:03.399> this

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
this back section actually delete this

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:13.649

don't do the same up here where we

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.839 
don't do the same up here where we
create<00:05:30.550> it

already did it up here and D create I've
got<00:05:38.709> to<00:05:38.829> do<00:05:38.979> it<00:05:39.069> down<00:05:39.279> in<00:05:39.459> the<00:05:39.610> update<00:05:39.999> polygon

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:40.709 
got to do it down in the update polygon

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:43.339 
got to do it down in the update polygon
so<00:05:41.709> we're<00:05:41.889> gonna<00:05:42.009> do<00:05:42.159> it<00:05:42.279> in<00:05:42.429> both<00:05:42.610> places<00:05:42.669> so

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
so we're gonna do it in both places so

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.609 
so we're gonna do it in both places so
just<00:05:44.349> delete<00:05:44.649> all<00:05:44.800> this<00:05:45.059> treat<00:05:46.059> this<00:05:46.619> then

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:47.619 
just delete all this treat this then

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:51.809 
just delete all this treat this then
just<00:05:48.039> just<00:05:48.369> change<00:05:48.699> this<00:05:48.879> to<00:05:48.939> get<00:05:49.300> distance<00:05:50.819> so

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
just just change this to get distance so

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.749 
just just change this to get distance so
that<00:05:52.240> should<00:05:52.719> be<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.169> I'm<00:05:53.439> gonna<00:05:53.649> try<00:05:54.129> and<00:05:54.550> see

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
that should be it I'm gonna try and see

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.290 
that should be it I'm gonna try and see
if<00:05:54.969> it's<00:05:55.209> going<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.539> work<00:05:56.459> so<00:05:57.459> yeah<00:05:57.879> as<00:05:58.119> you<00:05:58.149> can

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
if it's going to work so yeah as you can

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.319 
if it's going to work so yeah as you can
see<00:05:58.409> the<00:05:59.409> cube<00:06:00.009> is<00:06:00.159> now<00:06:00.309> not<00:06:00.550> being<00:06:00.759> drawn<00:06:01.029> in

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:01.329 
see the cube is now not being drawn in

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:03.869 
see the cube is now not being drawn in
any<00:06:01.539> weird<00:06:01.929> kind<00:06:02.139> of<00:06:02.169> way<00:06:02.229> you<00:06:03.219> can<00:06:03.339> see<00:06:03.519> it's<00:06:03.669> a

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
any weird kind of way you can see it's a

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.479 
any weird kind of way you can see it's a
it's<00:06:03.999> a<00:06:04.239> cube<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:04.689> there's<00:06:04.899> no<00:06:05.129> fancy<00:06:06.129> things

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:06.489 
it's a cube and there's no fancy things

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:10.199 
it's a cube and there's no fancy things
just<00:06:06.789> a<00:06:06.909> 3d<00:06:07.119> cube<00:06:08.579> but<00:06:09.579> that's<00:06:09.759> pretty<00:06:10.089> awesome

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:10.209 
just a 3d cube but that's pretty awesome

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:13.379 
just a 3d cube but that's pretty awesome
that<00:06:10.539> it's<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:11.889> is<00:06:12.129> actually<00:06:12.879> a<00:06:12.909> cube<00:06:13.269> and

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
that it's that is actually a cube and

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.589 
that it's that is actually a cube and
it's<00:06:13.509> not<00:06:13.659> being<00:06:13.839> drawn<00:06:14.110> really<00:06:14.860> weird<00:06:15.599> so

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
it's not being drawn really weird so

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.649 
it's not being drawn really weird so
yeah<00:06:17.439> I<00:06:17.469> think<00:06:17.649> that's<00:06:17.919> it<00:06:18.129> for<00:06:18.249> this<00:06:18.339> tutorial

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
yeah I think that's it for this tutorial

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
bit more see if I can get it in a good

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.790 
bit more see if I can get it in a good
position
