especially because i guess he just took
time<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.369> make<00:00:21.520> it<00:00:21.669> himself<00:00:21.759> and<00:00:22.270> he<00:00:22.660> made<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:22.930> a

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
time to make it himself and he made it a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.230 
time to make it himself and he made it a
really<00:00:23.169> nice<00:00:23.439> so<00:00:23.860> what<00:00:24.430> this<00:00:24.579> is<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:24.970> this<00:00:25.060> is<00:00:25.119> a

here we got the winners podiums and I

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.430 
here we got the winners podiums and I
guess<00:00:40.780> that's<00:00:40.960> where<00:00:41.079> they<00:00:41.170> take<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
guess that's where they take the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.470 
guess that's where they take the
photobooth<00:00:41.890> pop<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.610> champagne<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.240> get<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
photobooth pop the champagne and get the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.030 
photobooth pop the champagne and get the
kissed<00:00:43.690> on<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:43.960> cheeks<00:00:44.290> I<00:00:44.560> think<00:00:44.800> that's<00:00:44.920> how

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
kissed on the cheeks I think that's how

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.319 
kissed on the cheeks I think that's how
it<00:00:45.070> goes<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.400> haven't<00:00:45.550> actually<00:00:45.760> watched<00:00:46.120> the

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
it goes I haven't actually watched the

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
end of a race before except if it's in

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.470 
end of a race before except if it's in
like<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.370> movie<00:00:48.640> or<00:00:48.730> something<00:00:49.060> but<00:00:49.210> here<00:00:49.390> are

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
like a movie or something but here are

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.690 
like a movie or something but here are
the<00:00:49.510> cars<00:00:49.840> all<00:00:50.380> lined<00:00:50.680> up<00:00:50.890> ready<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.280> go<00:00:51.430> it's

the cars all lined up ready to go it's

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.040 
the cars all lined up ready to go it's
cool<00:00:51.850> cuz<00:00:52.090> they're<00:00:52.210> lined<00:00:52.390> up<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:52.630> guess<00:00:52.870> my

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
cool cuz they're lined up I guess my

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.690 
cool cuz they're lined up I guess my
team<00:00:53.380> I<00:00:53.590> don't<00:00:53.800> know<00:00:53.890> if<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.310> doesn't

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
team I don't know if that that doesn't

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.190 
team I don't know if that that doesn't
happen<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.090> real<00:00:55.149> racing<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.630> don't<00:00:55.780> think<00:00:56.020> but

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
happen in real racing I don't think but

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.680 
happen in real racing I don't think but
I<00:00:56.230> guess<00:00:56.950> these<00:00:57.100> are<00:00:57.160> these<00:00:57.430> would<00:00:57.790> be<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.149> guess

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
I guess these are these would be I guess

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.440 
I guess these are these would be I guess
teams<00:00:59.050> or<00:00:59.440> or<00:00:59.920> just<00:01:00.160> identical<00:01:00.940> cars<00:01:01.149> I'm

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
teams or or just identical cars I'm

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.970 
teams or or just identical cars I'm
assuming<00:01:01.960> they're<00:01:02.079> teams<00:01:02.290> I<00:01:02.559> don't<00:01:02.770> know<00:01:02.829> why

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
assuming they're teams I don't know why

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.350 
assuming they're teams I don't know why
else<00:01:03.130> it'd<00:01:03.250> have<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.579> exact<00:01:03.880> same<00:01:03.910> car<00:01:04.329> but

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
else it'd have the exact same car but

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.899 
else it'd have the exact same car but
yeah<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.259> is<00:01:05.320> what<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.740> here's<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.520> public

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
yeah it is what it is here's the public

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.719 
yeah it is what it is here's the public
highway<00:01:07.119> where<00:01:07.540> cars<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:07.960> come<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:09.219> get

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
highway where cars can come in and get

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.209 
highway where cars can come in and get
over<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.390> into<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.200> garage<00:01:11.290> here<00:01:11.740> well<00:01:12.189> I

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
over and into the garage here well I

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.709 
over and into the garage here well I
guess<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:12.610> isn't<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:13.210> probably<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.689> a

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
guess this isn't this probably is a

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.120 
guess this isn't this probably is a
little<00:01:13.869> bit<00:01:14.079> restricted<00:01:14.620> on<00:01:14.770> they<00:01:14.950> probably

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
little bit restricted on they probably

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.770 
little bit restricted on they probably
don't<00:01:15.340> let<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.549> just<00:01:15.760> anyone<00:01:16.180> go<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.600> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
don't let that just anyone go into the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.480 
don't let that just anyone go into the
middle<00:01:17.020> here<00:01:17.200> where<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.440> trucks<00:01:17.680> are<00:01:17.890> but<00:01:18.400> it

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
middle here where the trucks are but it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.950 
middle here where the trucks are but it
is<00:01:18.580> what<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.880> is<00:01:18.970> I'm<00:01:19.090> not<00:01:19.120> sure<00:01:19.240> what<00:01:19.780> that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
all the trucks are the same to which I

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.219 
all the trucks are the same to which I
thought<00:01:57.520> was<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> cool<00:01:58.000> minor<00:01:58.270> detail<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:59.200> have

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
thought was a cool minor detail you have

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.960 
thought was a cool minor detail you have
of<00:01:59.470> course<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.860> big<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.310> big<00:02:00.340> ones<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.880> then

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
of course the big the big ones and then

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.940 
of course the big the big ones and then
of<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.119> flat-faced<00:02:01.600> ones<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.560> got<00:02:02.740> all

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
of the flat-faced ones they got all

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.100 
of the flat-faced ones they got all
kinds<00:02:03.430> of<00:02:03.520> trucks<00:02:03.820> um<00:02:04.240> also<00:02:04.720> they<00:02:05.020> have

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.550 
helicopters I guess from medical or
emergency<00:02:07.210> or<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.750> don't<00:02:07.810> know<00:02:08.019> what<00:02:08.229> what
