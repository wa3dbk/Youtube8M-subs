00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.690
 Hello, how welcome are you? 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.639
 friend pegaso 21 this time 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.520
 I bring two materials enough 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.070
 interesting and good that the personal yes 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.240
 It cost me a little to find out 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.619
 account 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.910
 how to create these two materials but 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 well I found a very simple way 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.820
 to create these two is about a unicel 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.570
 and from a plastic we will see the way 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.730
 of how we create these materials 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.370
 and obviously we're going to go to the editor 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.670
 materials and let's start with the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.879
 unicel 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.059
 the way to create the whistle I went 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.170
 here to the fuzzy channel and place the value 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.170
 of 215 to not give it such a white tone 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.530
 but with a shade of gray and in the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 reflections the value of 13 also within 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 of gloss ends the value of 0.6 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.740
 and with this we obtain a shine as 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 remember that the unicel despite what 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 pack that is the material also has 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.890
 a kind of shine and in the hbo channel 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 with an exaggerated value of 700 units 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.050
 this texture is placed that unloads 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.060
 of the network 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.710
 and you can look for the one that most 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 agree and with that we have achieved in 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.870
 the weezer material that is the one that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.850
 we have here as you can see it looks 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.150
 pretty good, let's continue 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.860
 with this other one is a plastic 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 with one with a more advanced finish not 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.160
 here in the diffuse I put the value of 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 cent but in the color and you can 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.600
 choose any color not necessarily 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.050
 it has to be red so this is what 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.380
 I leave at your discretion the reflexes if 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.270
 place them with a value of 99 activate the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 fresnal reflection in 0.6 and theaters 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.480
 in the xerez if I put the value of 1 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.880
 are going to see how the material changes like this 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.980
 How good I told you the value of 6 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.600
 because if they have a certain importance 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.780
 in this type of material 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.690
 and well with that we have achieved these 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.910
 two pretty simple materials like 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 always a basic scene and remember 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.140
 that you could move the settings 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060
 depending on the scene well that 's 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.040
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.390
 forget to subscribe and see you in a 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.390
 next opportunity thanks
