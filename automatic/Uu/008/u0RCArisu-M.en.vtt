 Hi everyone how are you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 welcome once more to the channel 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.940
 video of the touch is time to kill the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 his technical doubts about mechanics and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 cars on the internet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 the people to start the game that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 Today's first question comes from the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 franklin s 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 araujo he owns a g5 goal and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 now day 12 he will do his review and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.730
 he is in doubt whether to exchange or not 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 Look at the power steering after all. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.109
 counts the lake level of the reservoir 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 direction of ortega has already lowered a little and 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.930
 want to know whether or not to exchange 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 Good fluid chicken is the next you go 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 swap surgery is dirty 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 According to him, there is no more that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.410
 characteristic red of the fluid there 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.620
 yes you can change if it is clear 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 Nice enough just complete and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 josephine nice 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 the chicken also takes the opportunity to ask 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.989
 If you have any problems getting the car started 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.210
 with air conditioning on or 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.440
 when those switches 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.480
 parked or that button 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.400
 the air conditioner selector is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 off if you have a problem 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.990
 turn on the car so it does not have any 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.420
 problem can turn on because the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.920
 air conditioners do not call immediately 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.560
 compressor does not replace it immediately 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.590
 even those buttons being on only 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.869
 after the price the statue catches the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 Air conditioning system pressure therein 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.600
 yes that will activate the compressor can not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 turn on 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 Yes, I have something with me. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.229
 I'd rather start the car engine with everything. 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 I turned the headlight off these things I think 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.170
 which may have a voltage spike a thing 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.200
 what is a lamp 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.770
 I like to avoid but there's no problem 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 nice beauty the next technical doubt 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 comes from the bid 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 he has 1 sara a citroen xsara bts 1.8 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.750
 16 beautiful car here year 2000 yellow should 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 follow golden yellow in her is cool 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.619
 this car 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.409
 I'm a fan of the car and mine is a reality 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.350
 it turns out he's hitting it tappets 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 took a trusted mechanic to 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.110
 to replace luxuries but not luxuries 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
 were replaced 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 the mechanic only charged the cleaning of the tubes 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.120
 hydraulics and said that I should 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.120
 replace the full head because it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.810
 were the luxuries 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.549
 yes the cup in the headstock conduits 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.230
 constitutive embedded 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.670
 he was disappointed in the final 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 accounts he paid for a non-service 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.940
 solved the sewing machine noise 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.110
 good there is this problem of 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.930
 little body 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.480
 in fact this body is the places 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.579
 nor the holes in the head where the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.720
 insects are embedded may have 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.200
 happened to your car from an employee 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.420
 with some lubrication deficiency and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.549
 have worn that place where everything is 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.579
 the work then even putting a 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.510
 new course it can get loose 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.400
 doing the same 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.170
 is to beat or make a characteristic noise 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.790
 sewing machine 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 only has one detail its mechanic then 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.519
 should have neither cleaned the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 courses 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.440
 after all, he should then have 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.299
 reported the head situation before 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.269
 to run the service 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.459
 he has another doubt that beyond 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.709
 cleaning of the pipes a cleaning of the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.709
 electrons getores replacement of the candles 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.230
 he had complained of performance the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.989
 performance has improved but the engine still 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.669
 it hardly goes to 5,000 rpm is well 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.000
 low at low speeds 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.510
 this has to do with the showers beats 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.120
 good 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.609
 the head of the car I'm on 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.220
 directly to the performance of the 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.959
 after all a problem of tuschi 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.370
 a problem in the workings of the works 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.599
 will directly affect the filling 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.569
 two cylinders 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.239
 therefore if you have a disability in this 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.400
 part of the head a navigation a 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.250
 difficulty in opening and closing the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.319
 valves can compromise sim performance 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.359
 and I think your car might be up 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 even out of sync to not 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.810
 to pass 5,000 rpm 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.699
 suddenly has a point owner one 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.220
 fuel pump program is 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.349
 very difficult to say anything without 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.650
 I can analyze the nice car and I hope 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.459
 to help or at least give a north 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.889
