00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.459 
can go wrong in the following way
unmoved<00:01:11.130> five<00:01:11.369> C<00:01:12.060> takes<00:01:12.329> D<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.840> fine

how<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.929> got<00:01:21.990> its<00:01:22.229> name<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:22.709> Knight<00:01:23.399> takes<00:01:23.639> d5

is<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.329> serious<00:01:24.779> blunder<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.679> black<00:01:26.310> can

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
is a serious blunder because black can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.639 
is a serious blunder because black can
simply<00:01:26.789> take<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.029> knight<00:01:27.329> give<00:01:28.109> up<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> Queen
