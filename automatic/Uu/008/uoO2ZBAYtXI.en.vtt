in gluing on fret boards so this is the
recent<00:00:06.000> fret<00:00:06.270> board<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.629> just<00:00:06.870> completed<00:00:07.259> for

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
recent fret board I just completed for

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.110 
recent fret board I just completed for
my<00:00:07.620> daughter<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.130> doesn't<00:00:08.340> have<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> radius<00:00:08.910> on

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
my daughter it doesn't have a radius on

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.379 
my daughter it doesn't have a radius on
it<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.360> anything<00:00:09.530> what<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.940> take<00:00:12.179> these

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
it or anything what I do is I take these

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.620 
it or anything what I do is I take these
little<00:00:12.719> pins<00:00:13.559> maple<00:00:14.130> pins<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.179> drill<00:00:15.450> them

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
little pins maple pins and I drill them

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.050 
little pins maple pins and I drill them
in<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> neck<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.160> fret<00:00:17.400> board<00:00:19.850> via<00:00:20.850> my

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
in to the neck and the fret board via my

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.800 
in to the neck and the fret board via my
template<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.789> what<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.970> does<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> allows

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
template and what that does is allows

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.099 
template and what that does is allows
the<00:00:25.320> fret<00:00:25.560> board<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.920> sit<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.340> properly

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
the fret board to sit in properly

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
the fret board to sit in properly
without<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.439> moving<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.939> times<00:00:30.150> if

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
without it moving so a lot of times if

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700 
without it moving so a lot of times if
you<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> you'll<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> glue<00:00:31.590> on

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you don't do this you'll go to glue on

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.250 
you don't do this you'll go to glue on
the<00:00:31.830> fret<00:00:32.070> board<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.669> it'll<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> move

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the fret board and it'll start to move

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.880 
the fret board and it'll start to move
and<00:00:34.590> wander<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.450> these<00:00:36.450> pins<00:00:36.780> help<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> stay

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and wander and these pins help it stay

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
and wander and these pins help it stay
in<00:00:38.040> place<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.520> only<00:00:38.640> need<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> really

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
in place so you only need to really

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
in place so you only need to really
drill<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.320> eighth<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> inch

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
drill it in about an eighth of the inch

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
drill it in about an eighth of the inch
or<00:00:41.760> less<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.450> each<00:00:42.899> side<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.460> these

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
or less on each side and you get these

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.900 
or less on each side and you get these
tiny<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.440> pins<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.280> quarter<00:00:47.789> inch

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
tiny little pins this is a quarter inch

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
tiny little pins this is a quarter inch
piece<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> maple<00:00:48.510> quarter<00:00:49.469> inch<00:00:49.620> dowel<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
piece of maple quarter inch dowel that I

piece of maple quarter inch dowel that I
use<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> pin<00:00:53.210> what<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.750> glue<00:00:55.020> in

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
use as the pin what I do is I glue in

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520 
use as the pin what I do is I glue in
the<00:00:55.320> pin<00:00:55.530> first<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> fret<00:00:56.460> board<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.899> when

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the pin first on the fret board and when

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
the pin first on the fret board and when
I<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> glue<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> neck<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.809> fret<00:01:01.020> board

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I go to glue in the neck the fret board

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.570 
I go to glue in the neck the fret board
on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> neck<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:03.270> line<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.750> up
