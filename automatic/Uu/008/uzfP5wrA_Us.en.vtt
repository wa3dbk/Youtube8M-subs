00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.400
 almost everywhere 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.720
 I wanted 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.810
 Vintage separation 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.029
 the whole case 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.319
 while Renault

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.539
 is not that yet 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 They do not know what's going on in Pirmasens 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.230
 I wonder what to use 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.630
 after that was 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.800
 then take over 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.280

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.850
 and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.270
 as an enhancement to them, it has indeed been called itself 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.319
 while that is 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.430
 and the CS attaches to the 12th 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.170

 2 12 inch Spiekermann 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.940

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 40 degrees 2 percent 4 6 4 6 4 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.950

 1 phone can well 4 21 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 and on the other side 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.010
 we have a Sennheiser 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.939

 I'll do it again I do not know otherwise recognized 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 So the 21 15 are hotter on the other side 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.010
 they have learned 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.010
