00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.720
 ah 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.470
 that I am Pedro again I am again 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.779
 again for the second time in a row this 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.119
 time I come with a mega super video I hope 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.040
 you like cocoons before anything else 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.470
 I would like to clarify that I do not intend to offend 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.390
 to anyone when doing this video because every 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.519
 who believes what he wants to believe so 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.500
 this video was made in order to be able 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.690
 analyze with more logic the theory and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.400
 take into account both points those that 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.570
 they favor theory and school 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.519
 they deny 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.379
 Now we can stop having blowjobs 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.019
 continue with this video in this video other 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.660
 a few days ago I saw that a theory 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.030
 of guixar that theory has become popular 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.399
 tells us that all movies are 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.739
 connected good so we'll see some 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.079
 points to disprove said web theory 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.660
 the theory tells us that movies from 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.789
 pixar are united under the first point 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.039
 tells us that in brave the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.530
 why animals behave like 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.509
 humans but now take this into account 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.580
 if the animals did not have said 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.600
 human behavior the movies 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.600
 they would be something like that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.840
 boring does not think he sees us 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 animals with this human behavior 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 because then it would be pointless to see the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.469
 movie if the characters had the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.539
 human behavior would be all a 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.520
 success and they would earn a lot of money that 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.130
 after all that's why there is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.020
 Pizza tell me it's also said that in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 ratatouille the protagonist wants 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.280
 cook but that's only what the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.439
 humans because this was done in order to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.390
 give a video message anyone can 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.520
 be an artist but an artist can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 come from either side now too 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.200
 may think that it is not that the animals 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.539
 are evolving to create a 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.640
 revolution simply need that 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.590
 behavior to be able to create a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 children's movie now to move to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 next point I need to make the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.250
 next question you were asking 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 in your first three years of life if not 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.329
 they remember it is normal nobody remembers 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.430
 that he was alive for the first years 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.170
 then it is illogical to think that hard 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.269
 is traumatized for life because the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.490
 theory tells us that as you know the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.680
 secret of the monsters that the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.110
 they are more skilled than humans are 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.120
 obsesses with finding his friend sun and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 that after so much time 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.380
 transforms into the old decrepit 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.270
 brave because this old man 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.520
 travel through the doors of the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.680
 space has in addition this theory is 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.930
 reinforced because in the pigsty where 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.210
 live the old credit you can see the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.700
 next drawing even though his reads this 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.310
 year means that the old woman has known 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 blue because pixar dealt all the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.720
 we've seen a lot of sister ex in 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.700
 all the pixar movies like this 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.620
 brown girl who has adopted in her 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.050
 fourth but it does not mean that there 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 participated in toy this here you can see 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.490
 more of this kind of curiosities that has 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 done pixar good I have omitted all the 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.600
 part of the war between human 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.370
 artificial intelligence because I have been 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.650
 absurd fact but as I said to the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.610
 beginning of the video everyone believes what 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.530
 who wants to believe 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.840
 thanks for killing neurons seeing us 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.980

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.980
