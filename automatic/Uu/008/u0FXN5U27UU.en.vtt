back<00:01:13.250> with<00:01:13.549> spray<00:01:13.939> can<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.700> today<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.729> just

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
back with spray can and today I just

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.820 
back with spray can and today I just
pinstripe<00:01:17.540> them<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.470> guys<00:01:21.530> know

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
pinstripe them and just so you guys know

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.640 
pinstripe them and just so you guys know
I<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:22.400> started<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:22.850> like<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:24.079> think<00:01:24.530> like

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
I just started this like I think like

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.480 
I just started this like I think like
three<00:01:24.860> or<00:01:24.979> four<00:01:25.040> days<00:01:25.340> ago<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:26.390> striping<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
three or four days ago and striping and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.370 
three or four days ago and striping and
so<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:28.610> not<00:01:28.700> perfect<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.990> know<00:01:30.079> lying

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
so it's not perfect you know lying

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.320 
so it's not perfect you know lying
consistency<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.430> not<00:01:31.810> great

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.160 

you<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.450> don't<00:01:37.600> know<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.720> don't<00:01:37.990> know<00:01:38.050> what

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
you know I don't know I don't know what

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.740 
you know I don't know I don't know what
to<00:01:38.260> say<00:01:38.410> she's<00:01:38.650> not<00:01:38.830> perfect<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.450> think<00:01:40.510> he

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
to say she's not perfect but I think he

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.110 
to say she's not perfect but I think he
looks<00:01:40.870> pretty<00:01:41.170> good<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.380> that's<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:45.120> and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
looks pretty good so that's that and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.280 
looks pretty good so that's that and
this<00:01:46.840> was<00:01:47.050> done<00:01:47.230> with<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.530> Mac<00:01:47.820> zero<00:01:48.820> brush

I'm<00:02:41.430> reading<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> book<00:02:41.970> or<00:02:42.240> I've<00:02:42.690> read<00:02:42.960> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
I'm reading the book or I've read and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.040 
I'm reading the book or I've read and
I'm<00:02:43.290> referring<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> book<00:02:44.630> Alan<00:02:45.630> Johnson

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
I'm referring to the book Alan Johnson

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.930 
I'm referring to the book Alan Johnson
had<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> pinstripe<00:02:48.110> by<00:02:49.110> Alan<00:02:49.380> Johnson<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.670> he's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
had a pinstripe by Alan Johnson so he's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.330 
had a pinstripe by Alan Johnson so he's
the<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:52.380> know<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.560> I've<00:02:52.800> been<00:02:52.980> taking

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the one you know that I've been taking

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.440 
the one you know that I've been taking
influence<00:02:53.610> from<00:02:53.850> really<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.330> guess

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.460 

and<00:02:58.720> here's<00:02:59.319> my<00:02:59.470> table<00:03:00.090> all<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.240> practice<00:03:01.690> work

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
and here's my table all my practice work

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.750 
and here's my table all my practice work
on<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.739> table<00:03:03.069> here

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.610 

when<00:03:06.390> my<00:03:06.480> brush<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.930> soaking<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.379> mineral

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
when my brush is soaking in mineral

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.350 
when my brush is soaking in mineral
spirits<00:03:08.010> here

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
spirits here

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.740 
spirits here
these<00:03:10.280> pinstripes<00:03:11.280> are<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:12.120> pinstripe<00:03:12.599> on

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
these pinstripes are this pinstripe on

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.440 
these pinstripes are this pinstripe on
these<00:03:12.930> flames<00:03:13.260> were<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.340> Mac<00:03:14.549> double<00:03:14.909> zero<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
these flames were the Mac double zero I

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.350 
these flames were the Mac double zero I
figured<00:03:16.200> out<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:17.549> flames<00:03:17.819> on<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.060> one

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
figured out that the flames on that one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.780 
figured out that the flames on that one
they<00:03:19.319> were<00:03:19.409> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.530> thick<00:03:19.830> line<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.489> me<00:03:20.640> so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
they were a little thick line for me so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.530 
they were a little thick line for me so
I<00:03:20.819> decided<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.450> try<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:23.000> double<00:03:24.000> zero<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.420> this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
I decided to try the double zero on this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.750 
I decided to try the double zero on this
one<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.019> these<00:03:25.620> are<00:03:25.830> like<00:03:25.980> shorter<00:03:26.610> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
one and these are like shorter and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.800 
one and these are like shorter and
tighter<00:03:26.940> curves<00:03:27.299> on<00:03:27.599> these<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.660> done

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
tighter curves on these and this is done

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530 
tighter curves on these and this is done
with<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:31.110> Mac<00:03:31.319> triple<00:03:31.950> zero

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.899 

so<00:03:35.140> yeah<00:03:35.379> hopefully<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.459> have<00:03:36.640> some<00:03:36.819> more

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909
