00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.250
 or friends now we are here with the 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.400
 motorcycles and then it's the turn of the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.650
 tinka 20 fallen let's see what it is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.090
 made this motorcycle if it has good 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 acceleration if it has good speed 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.449
 But what are we going to measure in this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.669
 circuit is a track totally is a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 road route let's say but what I 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.210
 like to me is that it is a very 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 long and this allows you to see the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.019
 acceleration and especially see the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.599
 top speed that these have 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.500
 vehicles we are going to measure this motorcycle 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.920
 vindicator against the beat 801 rr against 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 the double and against coma and then we will 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 to start we are going to start this test and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.809
 then we are going to stop in this one that is 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.760
 a very very early acceleration go and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 Well, we already see that the Valencian cvm and the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.129
 double also and the bat louisin 21 rr 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.109
 he has also beaten the vindicator 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.410
 this means that an acceleration 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.760
 early does not have very good acceleration 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.710
 then let's go to the next 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 point where are these two 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 containers and let's say here it's going to be 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.380
 let's say we have more distance 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.659
 where we are good bless and torrÃ©n 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.060
 everything in last place the cradle already 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.190
 took off wash yourself and it's also a little 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.770
 higher and clearly it is at 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 last side and then there 's 24 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.050
 let's see how this competition advances 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.900
 and then doing time doing a little 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.550
 more than devouring kilometers I think the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.860
 I sold -catorce is going to behave well 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.750
 when they reach a higher speed 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.540
 when you have developed the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.640
 potential because these are these three 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.190
 motorcycles that is subtle side to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 bhatti the comma are very motorcycles 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.990
 aggressive or simply and simply 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.770
 its composition or its position 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.310
 driver also betrayed him as they are 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.310
 motorcycles that are totally 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.250
 focused on acceleration then 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 let's hope the bird indicator 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.840
 develop at speed and let's hope 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 to recover some land we go to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.380
 next point that is where we are going to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.330
 make a cut let's stop over here 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.310
 at this point you have to stop the camera 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.760
 pum and let's check how it is now 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.610
 the 20 hector has already passed to the abbot and it has already passed 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.709
 next to the multi and the Cuba is still in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.450
 first place then here and the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.849
 vindicator is in second place 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.980
 already regained the position it had the 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.650
 Abbot and the position having havana 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.410
 in second place and we're going to see this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.000
 rest of the race if they have a good 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.060
 top speed the vindicator that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 help reach the summit and because this 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.269
 sign we see as reference 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.459
 bursting the grave first and then 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.319
 comes to the blessed one I think it does not 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.360
 is reaching we're going to expect it to 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.489
 develop a little more side the race 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.130
 we see clearly that the cradle follows 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.690
 retaining the advantage is still retaining 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.870
 the advantage here we enter a straight 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.580
 that is a bit on the rise go here 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.010
 the power is also demanded a little 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.530
 because they have to climb to high 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.880
 speed and then practically both 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.519
 motorcycles that we are up at 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.459
 adult and wash and have already been an 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.500
 little left behind go because right now 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.519
 we are already going down and we are going 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.739
 descent 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.410
 Follow the crib first of all the truth 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.550
 it is surprising to hell 'and it holds 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.720
 Cuba the advantage 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.640
 the 24 then let's say that trying to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.340
 recover that advantage but why not the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.900
 Cuba already put conditions and then if 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 keeps the aquatic here first 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 we have this bridge with reference 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.930
 we enter with the cougar we enter with the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.050
 vindicator let's go in later with the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.080
 bati and at the end we go in with the wiki 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.420
 it puts us in with this then these 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.530
 three minutes and or the elections let's say 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.840
 that does not have a speed test 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.700
 but this is going to be a series that 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.950
 let's start let's say in the next 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.650
 weeks to see the top speed of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.360
 each one of the gta 5 vehicles 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.700
 let's do as I did with the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.440
 test drive where we were 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.510
 driving the two vehicles in a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.420
 circuit to determine how good 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.700
 are and well let's go the grave is over 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.130
 now let's see who enters the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.860
 indicator la vil y tor has beaten the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.680
 Abate has beaten 2000 and also 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.890
 wow came second, so in 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.650
 top speed is a good element is 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.200
 a good option in top speed without 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.290
 However, acceleration is not your thing 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.800
 acceleration 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.870
 they won these three motorcycles in this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.000
 there is always a better option that can 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 be the coma first after 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.120
 we can choose the one from 801 of herrera or 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.220
 then we also probably choose 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.950
 the other motorcycle to the last side 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.660
 then friends, we already saw what 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.880
 it is in speed all that remains in 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.580
 second place against the fault of this is 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.010
 nothing more to put ourselves say as a 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.570
 reference where this is located 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.340
 new motorcycle that is the line 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.340
 vindicator bye friends 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.139
 Y
