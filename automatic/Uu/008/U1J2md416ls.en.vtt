00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and things like that then this could be

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950

now as I said this recipe cannot be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.439

simpler<00:00:24.660> literally<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.730> some

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
simpler literally all you need is some

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.560 
simpler literally all you need is some
whole<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.410> almonds<00:00:29.240> which<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.420> been

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
whole more almonds which have been

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.889 
whole more almonds which have been
soaked<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.980> been<00:00:32.099> soaking<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.899> 24

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
soaked these have been soaking for 24

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
soaked these have been soaking for 24
hours<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.410> basically<00:00:34.680> double<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.280> size<00:00:35.460> when

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
hours they basically double in size when

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.750 
hours they basically double in size when
you<00:00:35.790> soak<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> great<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> some

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you soak them which is great and some

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.139 
you soak them which is great and some
honey<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:40.440> clean<00:00:40.860> water<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:41.850> all

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
honey and some clean water that's all

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.010 
honey and some clean water that's all
you<00:00:42.329> need

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you need

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
you need
I<00:00:43.079> say<00:00:43.530> clean<00:00:43.770> water<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.070> mean<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.340> filtered

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I say clean water I mean like filtered

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
I say clean water I mean like filtered
water<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.260> can

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
water if you can get it I mean you can

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
water if you can get it I mean you can
use<00:00:46.680> tap<00:00:46.920> water<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.340> you've<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.579> nothing<00:00:47.700> else

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
use tap water if you've got nothing else

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
use tap water if you've got nothing else
but<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.450> better<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:48.899> filtered<00:00:49.860> clean

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
but it's better to use filtered clean

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.729 
but it's better to use filtered clean
water<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> soak<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> almonds

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
water because when you soak the almonds

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
water because when you soak the almonds
you<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> chemicals<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> stuff<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you know all the chemicals and stuff in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420 
you know all the chemicals and stuff in
the<00:00:55.020> water<00:00:55.140> they'll<00:00:55.469> soak<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.250> well

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the water they'll soak up that as well

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
the water they'll soak up that as well
so<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> get<00:00:57.600> involved

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so you don't really want to get involved

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.150 
so you don't really want to get involved
with<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.680> filtered

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
with that so if you can use filtered

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
with that so if you can use filtered
water<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> Berkey<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.930> Berkey

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
water I use that the Berkey the Berkey

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.000 
water I use that the Berkey the Berkey
light<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:02.550> filter<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:04.830> does

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
light to filter all my water and it does

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.330 
light to filter all my water and it does
a<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.489> job<00:01:05.689> okay<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> festival<00:01:07.680> I

a really good job okay so the festival I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.950 
a really good job okay so the festival I
need<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.119> notes<00:01:09.390> I've<00:01:09.510> literally

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
i've just drained these off they were

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
i've just drained these off they were
just<00:01:12.600> soaked<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.900> water<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.290> 24<00:01:14.010> hours<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
just soaked in water for 24 hours and
I'm<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> blender<00:01:16.049> obviously<00:01:16.380> need<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I'm in a blender obviously need a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.679 
I'm in a blender obviously need a
blender<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:20.330> think<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
blender to do this I think I'm going to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.210 
blender to do this I think I'm going to
do<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.170> two<00:01:22.380> batches<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> got

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
do this in two batches because it got

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.050 
do this in two batches because it got
quite<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> lot<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.470> there<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
quite a lot there so there are the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
quite a lot there so there are the
almonds<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> soaked<00:01:27.540> almonds<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.740> just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
going to have some water I'm just going
to<00:01:31.350> fill<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:31.619> little<00:01:32.130> joke<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.670> some

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to fill up my little joke with some

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
to fill up my little joke with some
water<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.720> need<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.259> three<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.040> four

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
water and you need about three or four

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.819 
water and you need about three or four
cups<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.729> water

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.020 

I'll<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.979> back<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.780> okay<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.789> you<00:01:47.789> just

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I'll be back right okay and you just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.130 
I'll be back right okay and you just
fire<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.990> blender<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.689> they<00:01:51.689> start<00:01:51.990> with

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
fire up your blender and they start with

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
fire up your blender and they start with
nuts<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:52.859> turn<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> milk<00:01:58.969> right<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.200> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
nuts and they turn to milk right then so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
nuts and they turn to milk right then so
what<00:02:01.289> we<00:02:01.409> basically<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.859> there<00:02:02.039> is<00:02:02.310> almond

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
what we basically got there is almond

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.809 
what we basically got there is almond
