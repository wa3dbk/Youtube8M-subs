00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.320
HI, it’s 5am and the bivouac is moving to Mauritania. 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.320
Having crossed the border, the guys will enter today’s special. 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.460
The last refuelling before Mauritania. Diesel is €0.5/litre. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.060
Leaving Morocco, we enter a five-kilometre sand stripe. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.640
This stripe follows the whole borderline and is mined. This is the only road to cross the border. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.600
It took 3.5 hours to cross the Morocco-Mauritania border. 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.140
Morocco was OK, the Mauritanian side was in a complete chaos. 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.960
We’re in Mauritania. Stony and fast tracks give way to sand dune fields. Tomáš is their master. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.980
Tomorrow, the guys will leave for a very difficult stage so keep your fingers crossed.
